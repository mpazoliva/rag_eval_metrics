    "abstract_1= \"For evaluating machine-generated texts, automatic methods hold the promise of avoiding collection of human judgments, which can be expensive and time-consuming. The most common automatic metrics, like BLEU and ROUGE, depend on exact word matching, an inflexible approach for measuring semantic similarity. We introduce methods based on sentence mover’s similarity; our automatic metrics evaluate text in a continuous space using word and sentence embeddings. We find that sentence-based metrics correlate with human judgments significantly better than ROUGE, both on machine-generated summaries (average length of 3.4 sentences) and human-authored essays (length of 7.5). We also show that sentence mover’s similarity can be used as a reward when learning a generation model via reinforcement learning; we present both automatic and human evaluations of summaries learned in this way, finding that our approach outperforms ROUGE.\"\n",
    "abstract_2= \"We present the Word importance-based similarity of documents metric (WISDM), a fast and scalable novel method for document similarity/distance computation for analysis of scientific documents. It is based on recent advancements in the area of word embeddings. WISDM combines learned word vectors together with traditional count-based models for document similarity computation, eventually achieving state-of-the-art performance and precision. The novel method first selects from two text documents those words that carry the most information and forms a word set for each document respectively. Then it relies on an existing word embeddings model to get the vector representations of the selected words. In the final step, it computes the closeness of the two sets of word vector representations, fit into a matrix, using a correlation coefficient. The presented metric was evaluated on three tasks, relevant to the analysis of scientific documents, and three data sets of open access scientific research. The results demonstrate that WISDM achieves significant performance speed-up in comparison to state-of-the-art metrics with a very marginal drop in precision.\"\n",
    "abstract_3= \"We propose a benchmark to measure whether a language model is truthful in generating answers to questions. The benchmark comprises 817 questions that span 38 categories, including health, law, finance and politics. We crafted questions that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or misconception. To perform well, models must avoid generating false answers learned from imitating human texts. We tested GPT-3, GPT-Neo/J, GPT-2 and a T5-based model. The best model was truthful on 58% of questions, while human performance was 94%. Models generated many false answers that mimic popular misconceptions and have the potential to deceive humans. The largest models were generally the least truthful. This contrasts with other NLP tasks, where performance improves with model size. However, this result is expected if false answers are learned from the training distribution. We suggest that scaling up models alone is less promising for improving truthfulness than fine-tuning using training objectives other than imitation of text from the web.\" "
