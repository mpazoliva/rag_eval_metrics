1. They first create a set of contextualized representations for each word using a pre-trained language model, such as BERT or ELMO. These representations capture the word's meaning in the context of the surrounding words.
2. They then take the first principal component (PC) of these contextualized representations as the static embedding for each word. The first PC captures the most important information in the representations, and is often found to be a good approximation of the word's meaning.
3. They use this static embedding for each word as input to a downstream task, such as semantic similarity or analogy solving.

The authors note that using the first PC of the contextualized representations often outperforms using the raw word embeddings (such as GloVe or FastText) or the full set of contextualized representations. This is because the first PC captures the most important information in the representations, and can be used to capture the word's meaning in a more compact and efficient way.

In the table provided earlier, the authors show the performance of different static embedding methods on several benchmark tasks. The tasks include semantic similarity, analogy solving, concept categorization, and Semeval.

Here are some common methods for measuring model compactness:

1. Model size: One simple way to measure compactness is to count the number of parameters or the size of the model in terms of the number of weights, layers, or other components. This can be done using metrics such as the number of parameters, the number of layers, or the size of the model in megabytes (MB).
2. Model complexity: Another way to measure compactness is to evaluate the complexity of the model using metrics such as the number of computations required to make predictions, the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required, or the amount of memory used during inference.
3. Model depth: The depth of the model can also be used as a measure of compactness. Shallow models with fewer layers are generally more compact than deep models with many layers.
4. Model width: The width of the model, i.e., the number of input features or the number of output classes, can also be used as a measure of compactness. Models with a smaller width are generally more compact than models with a larger width.
5. Model pruning: Another way to measure compactness is to prune the model and measure the reduction in size and accuracy. This can be done using techniques such as weight pruning, where redundant weights are removed, or layer pruning, where entire layers are removed.
6. Compression ratio: Finally, the compression ratio of the model can be used as a measure of compactness. This can be done by compressing the model using techniques such as Huffman coding or arithmetic coding, and then measuring the reduction in size.

In the context of the two sentences you provided, the models are being evaluated based on their accuracy and compactness. The first sentence mentions that the models should be ""even langidhigh"" (i.e., have high accuracy) and ""present accurate result"" (i.e., produce accurate predictions). The second sentence mentions that the models should be ""compact"" and ""present compact one langidhigh"" (i.e., have a small size and produce compact predictions).

3. Leveraging structure flickrk entities and bibref: The author suggests leveraging the structure of flickrk entities and bibref to enrich the dataset and create a coreference graph that links phrases to entities. This can help identify biases and unwarranted inferences by analyzing the relationships between phrases and entities.
4. Applying Louvain clustering to the coreference graph: The author suggests applying Louvain clustering to the coreference graph to identify clusters of expressions that refer to similar entities. This can help identify biases and unwarranted inferences by analyzing the patterns of expression and the entities they refer to.

1. Ethnicity bias: The dataset seems to be biased towards certain ethnic groups, particularly black and Asian babies, as they are more likely to be mentioned in the data. The words ""white"" and ""black"" are used more frequently than other ethnicities, which suggests that the dataset may be biased towards these groups.
2. Gender bias: The dataset may also be biased towards traditional gender roles, as the examples provided in the context suggest that female surgeons and male nurses are inconsistent with traditional gender roles. This bias may be reflected in the language used to describe the babies, as well as in the examples provided.
3. Labeling bias: The dataset may be biased towards creating narrow labels for individuals, as the adjectives used to describe the babies may create expectations for their personalities or characteristics based on their ethnicity or gender. For example, the phrase ""tough woman"" may be used to describe a woman who does not fit traditional gender roles, but this label may be inconsistent with the actual characteristics of the individual.
4. Inconsistent labeling bias: The dataset may be biased towards inconsistent labeling, as the examples provided in the context suggest that certain labels may be used to describe individuals based on their ethnicity or gender, but these labels may not be consistent with the actual characteristics of the individuals. For example, the phrase ""black baby"" may be used to describe a baby who is black, but this label may not accurately reflect the baby's actual characteristics.
5. Strengthens conclusion bias: The dataset may be biased towards strengthening a conclusion that is not supported by the data, as the examples provided in the context suggest that the data may be used to support the conclusion that the dataset is biased towards certain ethnic groups, but this conclusion may not be supported by the actual data.

Overall, the dataset may be biased towards certain groups or characteristics, and it may be inconsistent in its labeling and descriptions of individuals.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. RNNs: In the first paper, the authors use a combination of BERT and a recurrent LSTM network (BiBRE) to perform text classification. They find that the RNN layer can capture long-term dependencies in the text sequence, which can be useful for certain tasks. However, they also note that the RNN layer can be computationally expensive and may not be as effective for very long sequences.
2. Transformers: In the second paper, the authors use a combination of BERT and a transformer network (RoBERTa and ToBERT) to perform text classification. They find that the transformer layer can capture both local and global dependencies in the text sequence, which can be useful for tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of the text. Additionally, they note that the transformer layer can be more efficient than the RNN layer for very long sequences.
3. Hierarchical representations: Both papers propose using hierarchical representations to improve the performance of the models. In the first paper, the authors use a combination of segment-level and document-level representations to capture both local and global dependencies in the text. In the second paper, the authors use a combination of word-level, segment-level, and document-level representations to capture a wide range of dependencies.
4. Fine-tuning: Both papers emphasize the importance of fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT models for the specific task at hand. They find that fine-tuning the models can significantly improve their performance, especially when compared to using the pre-trained models without any fine-tuning.

In summary, both RNNs and transformers can work well on top of BERT, depending on the specific task and dataset being used. The choice between the two may depend on the specific requirements of the task, such as the need to capture long-term dependencies or the need for efficient computation. Additionally, using hierarchical representations and fine-tuning the pre-trained models can further improve their performance",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5378534566649347e-27,0.9092234592987726,0.7621724314300329,0.0221238938053097,0.0099009900990099,0.2928208410739898,0.8181818181818182,0.479553610086441,0.8083126,0.1578117311000824,0.6057073473930359,0.0093288501258072,3,1.0,0.8896286196562498,0.5289941440545893,0.7674194613003085,1.0,4.0,0.8

1. Named Entity Recognition (NER): IPA recognizes and extracts custom entities from user input, assuming seven possible entities as defined in the table ""tabref"". The recognized entities are then converted into a universal standard, such as official chapter names, to facilitate post-labeling.
2. Next Action Prediction: IPA predicts the next action according to the given user input, considering custom actions defined in the table ""tabref"". The predicted actions are then labeled and added to the dataset.
3. Post-labeling: To ensure the accuracy of the predicted actions, IPA performs post-labeling on the original dataset, using the defined generic entity names such as ""chapter question nr"" and the variations of entities in the user input.
4. Plain Dialogues: IPA labels plain dialogues with unique dialogue indexes and pairs questions and responses with unique turn indexes.
5. Plain Information: IPA extracts information from the dialogues, such as entities, and stores it in a dictionary for further use.
6. Triples: IPA forms triples of user requests, next actions, and responses to train deep machine learning algorithms for dialogue management.

1. Knowledge Store (KS): It is a repository of knowledge that stores information in the form of a knowledge graph, which consists of entities, relations, and triples. The knowledge store is updated continuously as Lili acquires new knowledge.
2. Inference Engine: It is responsible for performing inference using the knowledge store. The inference engine uses an inference strategy, which is a sequence of actions, to derive conclusions from the knowledge store.
3. Interactive Action Selection: This component is responsible for selecting the next action to be taken based on the current state of the system. The selection is based on the inference strategy and the current query.
4. Relation Entity Matrix: It is a sparse matrix that stores relations between entities. The matrix is used in the prediction model to make predictions.
5. Task Experience Store: It stores the predictive performance of Lili on past learned tasks. The store is used to measure the quality of the predictions and to improve the model.
6. Incomplete Feature Database: It stores frequency information about incomplete paths in the form of tuples. The database is used to formulate machine learning queries.
7. Inference Stack: It is a stack that holds the query state information and the RL model. Lili always processes the top query on the stack.
8. Prediction Model: It is a model that learns from the past similar tasks and helps learn the current task. The model uses lifelong learning and transfer knowledge to improve its performance.
9. Similar Task Identification: It identifies similar tasks to the current task and factors them to compute the task similarity matrix.

Firstly, they propose a method that expands the requirement of monosemy by proposing several new sources of relatives, including previously unexplored sources based on WordNet data, to gather many training cases. This helps to alleviate the problem of uneven distribution of word senses.

Secondly, they modify the Nave Bayesian classifier by adjusting the prior probabilities of the target word senses based on the aggregated feature values corresponding to each sense. This helps to weaken the influence of improper distribution of training cases and omit context features that are not observed for every word sense.

Finally, they use a large corpus of million documents to build models based on training corpora of different sizes. Experiments show that the amount of training data is sufficient for the task.

NMF is used to decompose the term-document matrix into two non-negative matrices, which closely approximate the original data. The resulting matrices are then used to identify the prominent topics in the corpus.

The comparison of common words suggests that the religious theme of ISIS is stronger in Dabiq than in Rumiyah. The topics identified using NMF in Dabiq include Islamic law, hijrah (moving to another land), spousal relations, marriage, and motherhood, while Rumiyah includes topics such as ISIS's ideology, the caliphate, and the role of women in early Islam.

The manual labeling of topics is based on the NMF output, and the important words in each topic are listed in Table 1.

3. Word prediction loss: Attention loss is related to translation quality, and analyzing the relationship between attention loss and word prediction loss can provide insights into the impact of attention on translation accuracy.
4. Distribution of attention: Attention is not equally distributed across all parts of speech, and the distribution of attention can vary substantially across different pos tags.
5. Dependency roles: Attention can capture the dependency roles of words in a sentence, such as subject-verb-object relationships, and this information can be useful for improving translation accuracy.

2. Frequency differences: Attention loss varies substantially across different POS tags, with nouns and verbs having different attention patterns. This suggests that attention is not solely determined by the position of the word, but also by its semantic meaning.
3. Concentration differences: Attention concentration, as measured by entropy, is not always aligned with the word alignments. This indicates that attention is not always evenly distributed across all words in a sentence, but can be more concentrated in certain words or parts of the sentence.

Here's a breakdown of the annotation process:

1. Crowdsourcing: The dataset was collected using scoping crowdsourcing tasks, where crowd workers were prompted to provide questions and commands related to specific topic domains. This helped to generate a large amount of data that could be used to train an AI assistant.
2. Manual annotation: The collected data was then manually grouped and annotated to identify the intents behind each question or command. This involved manually labeling each query with the intent it was intended to fulfill, such as booking a flight or checking the weather.
3. Scoping tasks: To ensure that the annotated data was representative of the team's limited budget, the crowd workers were given a set of scoping tasks to complete. These tasks were designed to gather additional data that could be used to train the AI assistant, while also ensuring that the data was relevant and useful for the intended task.
4. Intent training queries: The annotated data was then used to train the AI assistant using a set of intent training queries. These queries were designed to test the assistant's ability to understand the intents behind the queries and provide appropriate responses.
5. Validation and testing queries: To validate the performance of the AI assistant, a set of testing queries was created to test its ability to understand the intents behind the queries and provide appropriate responses. These queries were designed to be representative of the types of queries that the assistant would receive in real-world use cases.

Overall, the dataset was annotated using a combination of manual annotation and crowdsourcing to generate a large and diverse set of queries that could be used to train and validate an AI assistant. The annotated data was then used to train the assistant using a set of intent training queries, and the assistant's performance was validated using a set of testing queries",0.0965517227357907,0.0246913572355162,0.0965517227357907,3.3871076583907755e-10,4.703691618824206,3.998705938265152,0.0898203592814371,0.0099605789774608,0.6912639141082764,0.0,0.1858827620744705,0.7189917,0.1732037365436554,0.3458870351314544,0.0018899463136807,3,1.0,1.0,0.4266786110433052,0.8847317051651906,0.8,1.0,

In other words, it is a matrix that shows how often two words appear together in the same sentence or in close proximity to each other, taking into account the context provided by the surrounding words.

The second-order co-occurrence matrix is different from a first-order co-occurrence matrix, which only captures the frequency of words appearing together in the same sentence, without considering the context provided by the surrounding words. The second-order co-occurrence matrix is a more robust measure of co-occurrence, as it takes into account the context in which the words appear, and can help to capture more subtle patterns of meaning and contextual relationships between words.

The second-order co-occurrence matrix is typically constructed by counting the number of times that each word appears in the context of each other word in the corpus, and then representing these counts as a matrix. The resulting matrix can be used for a variety of NLP tasks, such as text classification, topic modeling, and information retrieval",0.037037035356653,0.0,0.0185185168381345,1.755078754448573e-05,4.175647541895082,3.548887454226901,0.1095890410958904,0.0099980396000784,0.5775085091590881,0.7104864314738091,0.4733303487300873,0.7114857,0.1316044926643371,0.3764951825141907,0.0323291088299695,4,1.0,0.9963031395307906,0.7048173857253506,0.8317011003274456,1.0,4.0,0.9

Entity linking is the task of identifying and linking mentions of entities in unstructured text to their corresponding entries in a knowledge base.

The proposed method uses a deep learning model, specifically a combination of ELMo embeddings and a residual LSTM, to learn informative morphological representations of character sequences. These representations are then used to predict entity types. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled text, where each mention of an entity is annotated with its corresponding entity type.

To incorporate the knowledge base, the authors use a redirection list to map surface forms of entities to their corresponding entries in the knowledge base. The redirection list is a list of surface forms of entities that are equivalent to a single entry in the knowledge base. For example, ""Michael Jordan"" and ""Michael Jeffrey Jordan"" are both surface forms of the same entity in the knowledge base.

During training, the model is given a list of input tokens, and it predicts the entity types for each token. The model is trained to use the redirection list to map the input tokens to the corresponding entities in the knowledge base. This allows the model to learn the relationships between the surface forms of entities and their corresponding entries in the knowledge base.

The proposed method has several advantages over existing approaches. First, it combines the strengths of deep learning models and knowledge bases to improve the accuracy of entity linking. Second, it uses a redirection list to map surface forms of entities to their corresponding entries in the knowledge base, which helps to overcome the problem of ambiguity in entity mentions. Finally, the method is flexible and can be used with different types of knowledge bases, such as Wikidata",0.0851063814214577,0.02399999915872,0.0851063814214577,1.2534706072318841e-08,3.3992044851314893,2.994093228269525,0.1291666666666666,0.0099632272055819,0.5917650461196899,0.4403399034301835,0.791856586933136,0.6790838,0.0528813600540161,0.0689630582928657,0.0223403600480233,3,0.5714285714285714,0.8162566419244456,0.9358100588583548,0.8531285148610871,0.0,0.0,0.6

1. Loss of information: By clipping negative PMI, the model may be discarding useful information that could be used to improve rare word representations and word analogies.
2. Limited improvement: Clipping negative PMI may only provide limited improvement in rare word representations, as the negative information used to repel words may not be as effective as positive information in improving the representations.
3. Over-reliance on positive information: The model may become over-reliant on positive information, which could lead to biased representations of rare words and poor performance on negative word analogies.
4. Inability to capture negative relationships: Clipping negative PMI may prevent the model from capturing negative relationships between words, which could limit its ability to generalize to unseen data.
5. Increased risk of overfitting: By discarding negative information, the model may be more susceptible to overfitting, as it may not have enough information to learn from.

Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of clipping negative PMI and explore other methods for improving rare word representations and word analogies, such as incorporating PMI in the model or using other types of information, such as word embeddings or syntactic information",0.1025641011439842,0.0314136116674433,0.0854700840499671,3.3988249016535808e-06,3.947414772055717,3.6925301577283314,0.1256983240223464,0.0100950700774282,0.4118061363697052,1.1102230246251563e-16,0.5326918363571167,0.8096301,0.3187157213687897,0.7146604657173157,0.0425313589082593,3,0.8333333333333334,0.9967317050759356,0.729356781076346,0.8091405928961849,0.5,0.0,

They constructed this dataset by simply inserting negation elements into the original LAMA statements, such as ""Birds do not fly"" instead of ""Birds fly.""

They then experimented with querying pre-trained language models (specifically, BERT) on both the original LAMA statements and the negated versions of those statements. They compared the predictions made by the models on these two sets of statements and found that the predicted filler words often had high overlap. This suggests that negating a cloze statement can significantly change the predictions made by the model, and that the model is not able to handle negation well.

To analyze this phenomenon further, they identified a subset of cloze statements where the predictions were different for the original and negated versions.

1. Micro-precision and Recall: The table shows micro-precision and recall scores for various NER styles, including CONLL, KORE, ACE, and MSNBC datasets.
2. Common English News Texts: The table comparison is based on common English news texts, which suggests that the annotators are trained on a diverse range of news articles.
3. Micro-averaged Scores: The scores are micro-averaged, which means that the annotations are aggregated across multiple spans within each text, rather than just considering the overall accuracy of the annotations.

Based on these criteria, the state of the art in table comparison annotators for NER in English news texts appears to be:

1. KORE: The KORE dataset has achieved high micro-precision and recall scores, with a micro-precision score of 88.3% and a micro-recall score of 85.7%.
2. CONLL: The CONLL dataset has also achieved high scores, with a micro-precision score of 87.6% and a micro-recall score of 84.4%.

To capture this semantic similarity, the authors use a technique called ""embedding models,"" which map words or phrases to dense vector representations that capture their meaning. They specifically use three different embedding models: CBOW, PVDM, and GloVe.

The authors then use these embedding models to discover similar equations by comparing the vector representations of the words or phrases in the equations. They use two different methods to compare the vectors: cosine distance and Euclidean distance. The cosine distance measures the cosine of the angle between the vectors, while the Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between the vectors.

The decoder takes the previous output context information and the current input sequence feature vectors as input, and predicts the target sequence probability distribution over time. The beam search strategy is used to select the most likely sequence of words or characters at each time step, based on the predicted probability distribution. The final output of the decoder is a sequence of words or characters that forms a coherent and accurate transcription of the input speech.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the decoding process:

1. Initialization: The decoder starts by initializing a set of candidate sequences, each consisting of a sequence of words or characters. The length of the candidate sequences is determined by the maximum length of the input speech sequence.
2. Beam Search: The decoder uses a beam search strategy to select the most likely candidate sequences at each time step. The beam search strategy is based on the predicted probability distribution of the target sequence, which is computed by the decoder using the current input sequence feature vectors and the previous output context information.
3. Scoring: Each candidate sequence is scored based on its predicted probability distribution. The scores are used to rank the candidate sequences and select the top-ranked sequences for further processing.
4. Expansion: The decoder expands each selected candidate sequence by adding a new word or character to the end of the sequence, based on the predicted probability distribution of the next word or character.
5. Output: The final output of the decoder is a sequence of words or characters that forms a coherent and accurate transcription of the input speech.

The decoder uses a language model and a lexicon dictionary to generate text. The language model is trained on a large corpus of text data and is used to predict the probability distribution of the target sequence. The lexicon dictionary is used to map the predicted probabilities to actual words or characters.

The models are implemented using the PyTorch framework, which provides a flexible and efficient platform for training and deploying deep learning models",0.13513513331355,0.0311284036391164,0.1216216198000365,1.3345225289768412e-08,4.657157617219595,4.116212961548461,0.1664103690685413,0.0100098999010009,0.6920900344848633,0.5389076437382303,0.635001003742218,0.5875895,0.2346570491790771,0.6650747060775757,0.0362428302192187,4,0.7777777777777778,0.8673250051573622,0.7192036668111782,0.8532849603441561,1.0,5.0,0.9
