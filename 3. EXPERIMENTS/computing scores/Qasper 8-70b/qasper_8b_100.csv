0,0,What is the seed lexicon?,A vocabulary of positive and negative predicates that helps determine the polarity score of an event.,"The seed lexicon consists of positive and negative predicates.

2,2,How are relations used to propagate polarity?,"Based on the relation between events, the suggested polarity of one event can determine the possible polarity of the other event.","In this paper, we propose a simple and effective method for learning affective events that only requires a very small seed lexicon and a large raw corpus. As illustrated in Figure FIGREF1, our key idea is that we can exploit discourse relations BIBREF4 to efficiently propagate polarity from seed predicates that directly report one's emotions (e.g., “to be glad” is positive). Suppose that events $x_1$ are $x_2$ are in the discourse relation of Cause (i.e., $x_1$ causes $x_2$). If the seed lexicon suggests $x_2$ is positive, $x_1$ is also likely to be positive because it triggers the positive emotion. The fact that $x_2$ is known to be negative indicates the negative polarity of $x_1$. Similarly, if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in the discourse relation of Concession (i.e., $x_2$ in spite of $x_1$), the reverse of $x_2$'s polarity can be propagated to $x_1$. Even if $x_2$'s polarity is not known in advance, we can exploit the tendency of $x_1$ and $x_2$ to be of the same polarity (for Cause) or of the reverse polarity (for Concession) although the heuristic is not exempt from counterexamples.

4,4,How big is the Japanese data?,"7000000 pairs of events were extracted from the Japanese Web corpus, 529850 pairs of events were extracted from the ACP corpus.","As a raw corpus, we used a Japanese web corpus that was compiled through the procedures proposed by BIBREF13. To extract event pairs tagged with discourse relations, we used the Japanese dependency parser KNP and in-house postprocessing scripts BIBREF14. KNP used hand-written rules to segment each sentence into what we conventionally called clauses (mostly consecutive text chunks), each of which contained one main predicate. KNP also identified the discourse relations of event pairs if explicit discourse connectives BIBREF4 such as “ので” (because) and “のに” (in spite of) were present. We treated Cause/Reason (原因・理由) and Condition (条件) in the original tagset BIBREF15 as Cause and Concession (逆接) as Concession, respectively. Here is an example of event pair extraction.
We constructed our seed lexicon consisting of 15 positive words and 15 negative words, as shown in Section SECREF27. From the corpus of about 100 million sentences, we obtained 1.4 millions event pairs for AL, 41 millions for CA, and 6 millions for CO. We randomly selected subsets of AL event pairs such that positive and negative latter events were equal in size. We also sampled event pairs for each of CA and CO such that it was five times larger than AL. The results are shown in Table TABREF16.
FLOAT SELECTED: Table 1: Statistics of the AL, CA, and CO datasets.
We used the latest version of the ACP Corpus BIBREF12 for evaluation. It was used for (semi-)supervised training as well. Extracted from Japanese websites using HTML layouts and linguistic patterns, the dataset covered various genres. For example, the following two sentences were labeled positive and negative, respectively:
Although the ACP corpus was originally constructed in the context of sentiment analysis, we found that it could roughly be regarded as a collection of affective events. We parsed each sentence and extracted the last clause in it. The train/dev/test split of the data is shown in Table TABREF19.

6,6,How do the various social phenomena examined manifest in different types of communities?,Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.,"We find that dynamic communities, such as Seahawks or starcraft, have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities (Spearman's INLINEFORM0 = 0.70, INLINEFORM1 0.001, computed with community points averaged over months; Figure FIGREF11 .A, left). Similarly, more distinctive communities, like Cooking and Naruto, exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities (Spearman's INLINEFORM2 = 0.33, INLINEFORM3 0.001; Figure FIGREF11 .A, right).
As with monthly retention, we find a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community (Spearman's INLINEFORM0 = 0.41, INLINEFORM1 0.001, computed over all community points; Figure FIGREF11 .B, left). This verifies that the short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content. Interestingly, there is no significant relationship between distinctiveness and long-term engagement (Spearman's INLINEFORM2 = 0.03, INLINEFORM3 0.77; Figure FIGREF11 .B, right). Thus, while highly distinctive communities like RandomActsOfMakeup may generate focused commitment from users over a short period of time, such communities are unlikely to retain long-term users unless they also have sufficiently dynamic content.","Dynamic communities exhibit higher user retention rates, both short-term and long-term, while distinctive communities show higher short-term retention but not long-term.",0.256410253001315,0.0792079176159201,0.2307692273602893,2.023079706348914,45.617078402144486,41.05898981676384,0.1079057239057239,0.002792181890706,0.8915085792541504,0.9732802831209624,0.8849221467971802,0.7377541661262512,0.0862080370023315,0.326484739780426,3,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.8267949756867917,0.7358941050673276,0.9434589007556784,0.9,0.326484739780426

9,9,How is the clinical text structuring task defined?,CTS is extracting structural data from medical research data (unstructured). Authors define QA-CTS task that aims to discover most related text from original text.,"Clinical text structuring (CTS) is a critical task for fetching medical research data from electronic health records (EHRs), where structural patient medical data, such as whether the patient has specific symptoms, diseases, or what the tumor size is, how far from the tumor is cut at during the surgery, or what the specific laboratory test result is, are obtained. It is important to extract structured data from clinical text because bio-medical systems or bio-medical researches greatly rely on structured data but they cannot obtain them directly. In addition, clinical text often contains abundant healthcare information. CTS is able to provide large-scale extracted structured data for enormous down-stream clinical researches.
However, end-to-end CTS is a very challenging task. Different CTS tasks often have non-uniform output formats, such as specific-class classifications (e.g. tumor stage), strings in the original text (e.g. result for a laboratory test) and inferred values from part of the original text (e.g. calculated tumor size). Researchers have to construct different models for it, which is already costly, and hence it calls for a lot of labeled data for each model. Moreover, labeling necessary amount of data for training neural network requires expensive labor cost. To handle it, researchers turn to some rule-based structuring methods which often have lower labor cost.
To reduce the pipeline depth and break the barrier of non-uniform output formats, we present a question answering based clinical text structuring (QA-CTS) task (see Fig. FIGREF1). Unlike the traditional CTS task, our QA-CTS task aims to discover the most related text from original paragraph text. For some cases, it is already the final answer in deed (e.g., extracting sub-string). While for other cases, it needs several steps to obtain the final answer, such as entity names conversion and negative words recognition. Our presented QA-CTS task unifies the output format of the traditional CTS task and make the training data shareable, thus enriching the training data.

The distribution of this training-test dataset segmentation followed a 50% distribution of PTSD and No PTSD from the original dataset. Our final survey based classification results showed an accuracy of 96% in detecting PTSD and mean squared error of 1.2 in estimating its intensity given we have four intensity, No PTSD, Low Risk PTSD, Moderate Risk PTSD and High Risk PTSD with a score of 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Table TABREF29 shows the classification details of our experiment which provide the very good accuracy of our classification. To compare the outperformance of our method, we also implemented Coppersmith et. al. proposed method and achieved an 86% overall accuracy of detecting PTSD users BIBREF11 following the same training-test dataset distribution. Fig FIGREF28 illustrates the comparisons between LAXARY and Coppersmith et. al. proposed method. Here we can see, the outperformance of our proposed method as well as the importance of $s-score$ estimation. We also illustrates the importance of $\alpha -score$ and $S-score$ in Fig FIGREF30. Fig FIGREF30 illustrates that if we change the number of training samples (%), LAXARY models outperforms Coppersmith et. al. proposed model under any condition. In terms of intensity, Coppersmith et. al. totally fails to provide any idea however LAXARY provides extremely accurate measures of intensity estimation for PTSD sufferers (as shown in Fig FIGREF31) which can be explained simply providing LAXARY model filled out survey details.

13,13,How is the intensity of the PTSD established?,"Defined into four categories from high risk, moderate risk, to low risk.","There are many clinically validated PTSD assessment tools that are being used both to detect the prevalence of PTSD and its intensity among sufferers. Among all of the tools, the most popular and well accepted one is Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) Scale BIBREF15. This is a psychometric scale that assesses risk taking in five content domains: financial decisions (separately for investing versus gambling), health/safety, recreational, ethical, and social decisions. Respondents rate the likelihood that they would engage in domain-specific risky activities (Part I). An optional Part II assesses respondents' perceptions of the magnitude of the risks and expected benefits of the activities judged in Part I. There are more scales that are used in risky behavior analysis of individual's daily activities such as, The Berlin Social Support Scales (BSSS) BIBREF16 and Values In Action Scale (VIAS) BIBREF17. Dryhootch America BIBREF18, BIBREF19, a veteran peer support community organization, chooses 5, 6 and 5 questions respectively from the above mentioned survey systems to assess the PTSD among war veterans and consider rest of them as irrelevant to PTSD. The details of dryhootch chosen survey scale are stated in Table TABREF13. Table!TABREF14 shows a sample DOSPERT scale demographic chosen by dryhootch. The threshold (in Table TABREF13) is used to calculate the risky behavior limits. For example, if one individual's weekly DOSPERT score goes over 28, he is in critical situation in terms of risk taking symptoms of PTSD. Dryhootch defines the intensity of PTSD into four categories based on the weekly survey results of all three clinical survey tools (DOSPERT, BSSS and VIAS )
High risk PTSD: If one individual veteran's weekly PTSD assessment scores go above the threshold for all three PTSD assessment tools i.e. DOSPERT, BSSS and VIAS, then he/she is in high risk situation which needs immediate mental support to avoid catastrophic effect of individual's health or surrounding people's life.
Moderate risk PTSD: If one individual veteran's weekly PTSD assessment scores go above the threshold for any two of the three PTSD assessment tools, then he/she is in moderate risk situation which needs close observation and peer mentoring to avoid their risk progression.
Low risk PTSD: If one individual veteran's weekly PTSD assessment scores go above the threshold for any one of the three PTSD assessment tools, then he/she has light symptoms of PTSD.
No PTSD: If one individual veteran's weekly PTSD assessment scores go below the threshold for all three PTSD assessment tools, then he/she has no PTSD.","Based on weekly survey results of all three clinical survey tools (DOSPERT, BSSS, and VIAS) and the threshold defined by Dryhootch.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.66118012671092,12.12009468419287,10.72177289316315,0.124223602484472,0.0099009900990099,0.1182966455817222,0.4964019669779352,0.1182966455817222,0.4214913249015808,0.0030701529176158,0.1136545091867446,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.9135292077312096,0.2008129511955799,0.8032518047823198,0.9,0.1136545091867446

We evaluate our model and baseline models on three versions of the dataset. The first one (Inc) only considers the original data, containing naturally incorrect tweets, and achieves accuracy of 80$\%$ against BERT's 72$\%$. The second version (Corr) considers the corrected tweets, and shows higher accuracy given that it is less noisy. In that version, Stacked DeBERT achieves 82$\%$ accuracy against BERT's 76$\%$, an improvement of 6$\%$. In the last case (Inc+Corr), we consider both incorrect and correct tweets as input to the models in hopes of improving performance. However, the accuracy was similar to the first aforementioned version, 80$\%$ for our model and 74$\%$ for the second highest performing model. Since the first and last corpus gave similar performances with our model, we conclude that the Twitter dataset does not require complete sentences to be given as training input, in addition to the original naturally incorrect tweets, in order to better model the noisy sentences.

17,17,Which experiments are perfomed?,They used BERT-based models to detect subjective language in the WNC corpus.,"In natural language, subjectivity refers to the aspects of communication used to express opinions, evaluations, and speculationsBIBREF0, often influenced by one's emotional state and viewpoints. Writers and editors of texts like news and textbooks try to avoid the use of biased language, yet subjective bias is pervasive in these texts. More than $56\%$ of Americans believe that news sources do not report the news objectively , thus implying the prevalence of the bias. Therefore, when presenting factual information, it becomes necessary to differentiate subjective language from objective language.
In this work, we investigate the application of BERT-based models for the task of subjective language detection. We explore various BERT-based models, including BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, with their base and large specifications along with their native classifiers. We propose an ensemble model exploiting predictions from these models using multiple ensembling techniques. We show that our model outperforms the baselines by a margin of $5.6$ of F1 score and $5.95\%$ of Accuracy.

We follow the recommendations of the original STM paper and focus on exclusivity and semantic coherence measures. BIBREF5 propose semantic coherence measure, which is closely related to point-wise mutual information measure posited by BIBREF6 to evaluate topic quality. BIBREF5 show that semantic coherence corresponds to expert judgments and more general human judgments in Amazon's Mechanical Turk experiments.
Exclusivity scores for each topic follows BIBREF7 . Highly frequent words in a given topic that do not appear very often in other topics are viewed as making that topic exclusive. Cohesive and exclusive topics are more semantically useful. Following BIBREF8 we generate a set of candidate models ranging between 3 and 50 topics. We then plot the exclusivity and semantic coherence (numbers closer to 0 indicate higher coherence), with a linear regression overlaid (Figure FIGREF3 ).

In multi-task training setting where a single model is trained to solve all the tasks at once, PRN and BIDAF w/ static memory perform comparably and give much better results than BIDAF. Note that the model performances in the multi-task training setting are worse than single-task performances.

27,27,How was the dataset collected?,"They crawled travel information from the Web to build a database, created a multi-domain goal generator from the database, collected dialogue between workers an automatically annotated dialogue acts.","Our corpus is to simulate scenarios where a traveler seeks tourism information and plans her or his travel in Beijing. Domains include hotel, attraction, restaurant, metro, and taxi. The data collection process is summarized as below:
Database Construction: we crawled travel information in Beijing from the Web, including Hotel, Attraction, and Restaurant domains (hereafter we name the three domains as HAR domains). Then, we used the metro information of entities in HAR domains to build the metro database. For the taxi domain, there is no need to store the information. Instead, we can call the API directly if necessary.
Goal Generation: a multi-domain goal generator was designed based on the database. The relation across domains is captured in two ways. One is to constrain two targets that locate near each other. The other is to use a taxi or metro to commute between two targets in HAR domains mentioned in the context. To make workers understand the task more easily, we crafted templates to generate natural language descriptions for each structured goal.
Dialogue Collection: before the formal data collection starts, we required the workers to make a small number of dialogues and gave them feedback about the dialogue quality. Then, well-trained workers were paired to converse according to the given goals. The workers were also asked to annotate both user states and system states.
Dialogue Annotation: we used some rules to automatically annotate dialogue acts according to user states, system states, and dialogue histories. To evaluate the quality of the annotation of dialogue acts and states, three experts were employed to manually annotate dialogue acts and states for 50 dialogues. The results show that our annotations are of high quality. Finally, each dialogue contains a structured goal, a task description, user states, system states, dialogue acts, and utterances.","Through Database Construction, Goal Generation, Dialogue Collection, and Dialogue Annotation.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5784309053930103,33.122602032109,26.99925492283461,0.2343948325952669,0.0039840637450199,0.7175063490867615,0.7267506065327007,0.7175064086914062,0.5276880264282227,0.0238567242255185,0.1249428540468216,4,1.0,2.0,0.75,0.8719632958549829,0.7220488138724336,0.8881945344125657,1.0,0.1249428540468216

This baseline is the ROUGE version that performs best on each dataset, among the versions considered by BIBREF13. Although ROUGE focuses on surface similarities between peer and reference summaries, we would expect properties like grammaticality, referential clarity and coherence to be captured to some extent by ROUGE versions based on long $n$-grams or longest common subsequences.
Methods ::: Baselines ::: Language model (LM):
For a peer summary, a reasonable estimate of $\mathcal {Q}1$ (Grammaticality) is the perplexity returned by a pre-trained language model. We experiment with the pre-trained GPT-2 model BIBREF22, and with the probability estimates that BERT can produce for each token when the token is treated as masked (BERT-FR-LM). Given that the grammaticality of a summary can be corrupted by just a few bad tokens, we compute the perplexity by considering only the $k$ worst (lowest LM probability) tokens of the peer summary, where $k$ is a tuned hyper-parameter.
Methods ::: Baselines ::: Next sentence prediction:
BERT training relies on two tasks: predicting masked tokens and next sentence prediction. The latter seems to be aligned with the definitions of $\mathcal {Q}3$ (Referential Clarity), $\mathcal {Q}4$ (Focus) and $\mathcal {Q}5$ (Structure & Coherence). Intuitively, when a sentence follows another with high probability, it should involve clear referential expressions and preserve the focus and local coherence of the text. We, therefore, use a pre-trained BERT model (BERT-FR-NS) to calculate the sentence-level perplexity of each summary:
where $p(s_i|s_{i-1})$ is the probability that BERT assigns to the sequence of sentences $\left< s_{i-1}, s \right>$, and $n$ is the number of sentences in the peer summary.","ROUGE, LM, Next sentence prediction.",0.3999999955555556,0.1538461495857989,0.3999999955555556,13.912311644176564,66.26215239297515,62.50113629209155,0.501827596710326,0.0082644628099173,0.7370163202285767,0.8337053986266255,0.7370162606239319,0.7679697871208191,0.0263881998886666,0.2498032748699188,4,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.7926266878044417,0.6571951094884828,0.9145574404664552,0.8,0.2498032748699188

For more in-depth performance analysis, we note: (1) Among all baselines, Path-based methods and Attribute-incorporated methods outperform three typical methods. This indicates that incorporating extra information can improve the knowledge graph embedding performance; (2) Four variants of KANE always outperform baseline methods. The main reasons why KANE works well are two fold: 1) KANE can capture high-order structural information of KGs in an efficient, explicit manner and passe these information to their neighboring; 2) KANE leverages rich information encoded in attribute triples. These rich semantic information can further improve the performance of knowledge graph; (3) The variant of KANE that use LSTM Encoder and Concatenation aggregator outperform other variants. The main reasons is that LSTM encoder can distinguish the word order and concatenation aggregator combine all embedding of multi-head attention in a higher leaver feature space, which can obtain sufficient expressive power.

In this section, we describe how each of these fields was generated for each Quasar variant.
The context document for each record consists of a list of ranked and scored pseudodocuments relevant to the question.
Several baselines rely on the retrieved context to extract the answer to a question. For these, we refer to the fraction of instances for which the correct answer is present in the context as Search Accuracy. The performance of the baseline among these instances is referred to as the Reading Accuracy, and the overall performance (which is a product of the two) is referred to as the Overall Accuracy. In Figure 4 we compare how these three vary as the number of context documents is varied. Naturally, the search accuracy increases as the context size increases, however at the same time reading performance decreases since the task of extracting the answer becomes harder for longer documents.

42,42,What supplemental tasks are used for multitask learning?,"Multitask learning is used for the task of predicting relevance of a comment on a different question to a given question, where the supplemental tasks are predicting relevance between the questions, and between the comment and the corresponding question.","Automation of cQA forums can be divided into three tasks: question-comment relevance (Task A), question-question relevance (Task B), and question-external comment relevance (Task C). One might think that classic retrieval models like language models for information retrieval BIBREF0 could solve these tasks. However, a big challenge for cQA tasks is that users are used to expressing similar meanings with different words, which creates gaps when matching questions based on common words. Other challenges include informal usage of language, highly diverse content of comments, and variation in the length of both questions and comments.
In our cQA tasks, the pair of objects are (question, question) or (question, comment), and the relationship is relevant/irrelevant. The left side of Figure 1 shows one intuitive way to predict relationships using RNNs. Parallel LSTMs encode two objects independently, and then concatenate their outputs as an input to a feed-forward neural network (FNN) with a softmax output layer for classification.
For task C, in addition to an original question (oriQ) and an external comment (relC), the question which relC commented on is also given (relQ). To incorporate this extra information, we consider a multitask learning framework which jointly learns to predict the relationships of the three pairs (oriQ/relQ, oriQ/relC, relQ/relC).","(oriQ/relQ, oriQ/relC, relQ/relC).",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1493330194206166,7.553269349781686,8.506149873372252,0.038860103626943,0.0007686395080707,0.0850880220532417,0.0,0.0850880071520805,0.0,0.0092712580122121,0.0573189929127693,3,1.0,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.78418524508445,0.5591720400336698,0.7366881601346793,0.0,0.0573189929127693

iMRC: Making MRC Interactive ::: Evaluation Metric
Since iMRC involves both MRC and RL, we adopt evaluation metrics from both settings. First, as a question answering task, we use $\text{F}_1$ score to compare predicted answers against ground-truth, as in previous works. When there exist multiple ground-truth answers, we report the max $\text{F}_1$ score. Second, mastering multiple games remains quite challenging for RL agents. Therefore, we evaluate an agent's performance during both its training and testing phases. During training, we report training curves averaged over 3 random seeds.

Tweets are subject to standard preprocessing steps for text such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop-word removal, and part-of-speech tagging. Moreover, due to their noisy nature, they are also processed using some Twitter-specific techniques such as substitution/removal of URLs, of user mentions, of hashtags, and of emoticons, spelling correction, elongation normalization, abbreviation lookup, punctuation removal, detection of amplifiers and diminishers, negation scope detection, etc. For this, one typically uses Twitter-specific NLP tools such as part-of-speech and named entity taggers, syntactic parsers, etc. BIBREF47 , BIBREF48 , BIBREF49 .
Despite all these opportunities, the rise of social media has also presented new challenges for natural language processing (NLP) applications, which had largely relied on NLP tools tuned for formal text genres such as newswire, and thus were not readily applicable to the informal language and style of social media. That language proved to be quite challenging with its use of creative spelling and punctuation, misspellings, slang, new words, URLs, and genre-specific terminology and abbreviations, e.g., RT for re-tweet and #hashtags. In addition to the genre difference, there is also a difference in length: social media messages are generally short, often length-limited by design as in Twitter, i.e., a sentence or a headline rather than a full document.

57,57,What semantic rules are proposed?,Rules that compute polarity of words after POS tagging or parsing steps.,"In Twitter social networking, people express their opinions containing sub-sentences. These sub-sentences using specific PoS particles (Conjunction and Conjunctive adverbs), like ""but, while, however, despite, however"" have different polarities. However, the overall sentiment of tweets often focus on certain sub-sentences. For example:
@lonedog bwahahah...you are amazing! However, it was quite the letdown.
@kirstiealley my dentist is great but she's expensive...=(
In two tweets above, the overall sentiment is negative. However, the main sentiment is only in the sub-sentences following but and however. This inspires a processing step to remove unessential parts in a tweet. Rule-based approach can assists these problems in handling negation and dealing with specific PoS particles led to effectively affect the final output of classification BIBREF11 BIBREF16 . BIBREF11 summarized a full presentation of their semantic rules approach and devised ten semantic rules in their hybrid approach based on the presentation of BIBREF16 . We use five rules in the semantic rules set because other five rules are only used to compute polarity of words after POS tagging or Parsing steps. We follow the same naming convention for rules utilized by BIBREF11 to represent the rules utilized in our proposed method.

61,61,What learning paradigms do they cover in this survey?,"Considering ""What"" and ""How"" separately versus jointly optimizing for both.","Past research took a reductionist approach, separately considering these two problems of “what” and “how” via content selection and question construction. Given a sentence or a paragraph as input, content selection selects a particular salient topic worthwhile to ask about and determines the question type (What, When, Who, etc.). Approaches either take a syntactic BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 or semantic BIBREF14 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 tack, both starting by applying syntactic or semantic parsing, respectively, to obtain intermediate symbolic representations. Question construction then converts intermediate representations to a natural language question, taking either a tranformation- or template-based approach. The former BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF13 rearranges the surface form of the input sentence to produce the question; the latter BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 generates questions from pre-defined question templates. Unfortunately, such QG architectures are limiting, as their representation is confined to the variety of intermediate representations, transformation rules or templates.
In contrast, neural models motivate an end-to-end architectures. Deep learned frameworks contrast with the reductionist approach, admitting approaches that jointly optimize for both the “what” and “how” in an unified framework. The majority of current NQG models follow the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) framework that use a unified representation and joint learning of content selection (via the encoder) and question construction (via the decoder). In this framework, traditional parsing-based content selection has been replaced by more flexible approaches such as attention BIBREF22 and copying mechanism BIBREF23 . Question construction has become completely data-driven, requiring far less labor compared to transformation rules, enabling better language flexibility compared to question templates.",Reductionist and end-to-end (neural) architectures.,0.133333328888889,0.0,0.133333328888889,3.1251907639724417,13.84570240374092,13.469257134802678,0.0699300699300699,0.005524861878453,0.2462866753339767,0.2531283323613691,0.2462866604328155,0.1218866184353828,0.0135222006584271,0.0404147692024707,3,1.0,1.0,,0.8055018135550505,0.1932691819519122,0.7730767278076491,0.8,0.0404147692024707

where INLINEFORM0 is the lexicon weight of the term, and INLINEFORM1 represents the frequency of the term in the user generated INLINEFORM2 , and INLINEFORM3 measures total word count in INLINEFORM4 . As our data is biased toward young people, we report age prediction performance for each age group separately (Table TABREF42 ).

Each plot depicts the average reward (across 5 seeds) of all representations methods. It can be seen that the NLP representation outperforms the other methods. This is contrary to the fact that it contains the same information as the semantic segmentation maps. More interestingly, comparing the vision-based and feature-based representations render inconsistent conclusions with respect to their relative performance. NLP representations remain robust to changes in the environment as well as task-nuisances in the state. As depicted in fig: nuisance scenarios, inflating the state space with task-nuisances impairs the performance of all representations. There, a large amount of unnecessary objects were spawned in the level, increasing the state's description length to over 250 words, whilst retaining the same amount of useful information.

The MFD is a psycholinguistic resource that associates each MFT category with a set of seed words, which are words that provide evidence for the corresponding moral category in text.

This dataset was collected through Mechanical Turk using 100 simulated environments with a corresponding topological map and, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first of its kind for behavioral navigation. The dataset opens up opportunities to explore data-driven methods for grounding navigation commands into high-level motion plans.
We created a new dataset for the problem of following navigation instructions under the behavioral navigation framework of BIBREF5 . This dataset was created using Amazon Mechanical Turk and 100 maps of simulated indoor environments, each with 6 to 65 rooms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark for comparing translation models in the context of behavioral robot navigation.
As shown in Table TABREF16 , the dataset consists of 8066 pairs of free-form natural language instructions and navigation plans for training. This training data was collected from 88 unique simulated environments, totaling 6064 distinct navigation plans (2002 plans have two different navigation instructions each; the rest has one). The dataset contains two test set variants:
While the dataset was collected with simulated environments, no structure was imposed on the navigation instructions while crowd-sourcing data. Thus, many instructions in our dataset are ambiguous. Moreover, the order of the behaviors in the instructions is not always the same. For instance, a person said “turn right and advance” to describe part of a route, while another person said “go straight after turning right” in a similar situation. The high variability present in the natural language descriptions of our dataset makes the problem of decoding instructions into behaviors not trivial.

77,77,How is morphology knowledge implemented in the method?,A BPE model is applied to the stem after morpheme segmentation.,"The problem with morpheme segmentation is that the vocabulary of stem units is still very large, which leads to many rare and unknown words at the training time. The problem with BPE is that it do not consider the morpheme boundaries inside words, which might cause a loss of morphological properties and semantic information. Hence, on the analyses of the above popular word segmentation methods, we propose the morphologically motivated segmentation strategy that combines the morpheme segmentation and BPE for further improving the translation performance of NMT.
Compared with the sentence of word surface forms, the corresponding sentence of stem units only contains the structure information without considering morphological information, which can make better generalization over inflectional variants of the same word and reduce data sparseness BIBREF8. Therefore, we learn a BPE model on the stem units in the training corpus rather than the words, and then apply it on the stem unit of each word after morpheme segmentation.","Morpheme segmentation is used to extract stem units, then BPE is applied on these units.",0.479999995072,0.0833333284722225,0.239999995072,6.10719615202126,43.73623666779133,39.10435664392384,0.505,0.0123456790123456,0.8140894770622253,0.7590645275063278,0.8140893578529358,0.8708999752998352,0.0603336012071609,0.9056061506271362,4,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.8211770052831314,0.6106975476223211,0.9428702995356062,0.9,0.9056061506271362
78,78,How is the performance on the task evaluated?,Comparison of test accuracies of neural network models on an inflection task and qualitative analysis of the errors.,"Neural network models, and specifically sequence-to-sequence models, have pushed the state of the art for morphological inflection – the task of learning a mapping from lemmata to their inflected forms – in the last years BIBREF6. Thus, in this work, we experiment on such models, asking not what they learn, but, motivated by the respective research on human subjects, the related question of how what they learn depends on their prior knowledge. We manually investigate the errors made by artificial neural networks for morphological inflection in a target language after pretraining on different source languages. We aim at finding answers to two main questions: (i) Do errors systematically differ between source languages? (ii) Do these differences seem explainable, given the properties of the source and target languages? In other words, we are interested in exploring if and how L2 acquisition of morphological inflection depends on the L1, i.e., the ""native language"", in neural network models.
For our qualitative analysis, we make use of the validation set. Therefore, we show validation set accuracies in Table TABREF19 for comparison. As we can see, the results are similar to the test set results for all language combinations.

80,80,Why does not the approach from English work on other languages?,"Because, unlike other languages, English does not mark grammatical genders.","To date, the NLP community has focused primarily on approaches for detecting and mitigating gender stereotypes in English BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 . Yet, gender stereotypes also exist in other languages because they are a function of society, not of grammar. Moreover, because English does not mark grammatical gender, approaches developed for English are not transferable to morphologically rich languages that exhibit gender agreement BIBREF8 . In these languages, the words in a sentence are marked with morphological endings that reflect the grammatical gender of the surrounding nouns. This means that if the gender of one word changes, the others have to be updated to match. As a result, simple heuristics, such as augmenting a corpus with additional sentences in which he and she have been swapped BIBREF9 , will yield ungrammatical sentences. Consider the Spanish phrase el ingeniero experto (the skilled engineer). Replacing ingeniero with ingeniera is insufficient—el must also be replaced with la and experto with experta.","English does not mark grammatical gender, making approaches developed for English non-transferable to morphologically rich languages.",0.3999999952,0.3333333286458333,0.3999999952,22.13908395073965,40.63498493450208,39.53729414114446,0.6095107453132146,0.0131578947368421,0.7266330718994141,0.7201138617211926,0.7266330718994141,0.9000558257102966,0.0218753812710114,0.8103207945823669,4,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.8854112770924395,0.6010905807786256,0.9043623231145024,0.8,0.8103207945823669

With respect to the methods only using precedent SQL as context, Action Copy significantly surpasses Tree Copy and SQL Attn in all metrics. In addition, we observe that there is little difference in the performance of Action Copy and Concat, which implies that using precedent SQL as context gives almost the same effect with using recent questions.

85,85,Is the baseline a non-heirarchical model like BERT?,There were hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines; BERT was one of those baselines.,"FLOAT SELECTED: Table 1: Results of various models on the CNNDM test set using full-length F1 ROUGE-1 (R-1), ROUGE-2 (R2), and ROUGE-L (R-L).
Our main results on the CNNDM dataset are shown in Table 1 , with abstractive models in the top block and extractive models in the bottom block. Pointer+Coverage BIBREF9 , Abstract-ML+RL BIBREF10 and DCA BIBREF42 are all sequence to sequence learning based models with copy and coverage modeling, reinforcement learning and deep communicating agents extensions. SentRewrite BIBREF26 and InconsisLoss BIBREF25 all try to decompose the word by word summary generation into sentence selection from document and “sentence” level summarization (or compression). Bottom-Up BIBREF27 generates summaries by combines a word prediction model with the decoder attention model. The extractive models are usually based on hierarchical encoders (SummaRuNNer; BIBREF3 and NeuSum; BIBREF11 ). They have been extended with reinforcement learning (Refresh; BIBREF4 and BanditSum; BIBREF20 ), Maximal Marginal Relevance (NeuSum-MMR; BIBREF21 ), latent variable modeling (LatentSum; BIBREF5 ) and syntactic compression (JECS; BIBREF38 ). Lead3 is a baseline which simply selects the first three sentences. Our model $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$ (in-domain), which only use one pre-training stage on the in-domain CNNDM training set, outperforms all of them and differences between them are all significant with a 0.95 confidence interval (estimated with the ROUGE script). Note that pre-training $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$ (in-domain) is very fast and it only takes around 30 minutes for one epoch on the CNNDM training set. Our models with two pre-training stages ( $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$ ) or larger size ( $\text{\sc Hibert}_M$ ) perform even better and $\text{\sc Hibert}_M$ outperforms BERT by 0.5 ROUGE. We also implemented two baselines. One is the hierarchical transformer summarization model (HeriTransfomer; described in ""Extractive Summarization"" ) without pre-training. Note the setting for HeriTransfomer is ( $L=4$ , $H=300$ and $A=4$ ) . We can see that the pre-training (details in Section ""Pre-training"" ) leads to a +1.25 ROUGE improvement. Another baseline is based on a pre-trained BERT BIBREF0 and finetuned on the CNNDM dataset. We used the $\text{BERT}_{\text{base}}$ model because our 16G RAM V100 GPU cannot fit $\text{BERT}_{\text{large}}$ for the summarization task even with batch size of 1. The positional embedding of BERT supports input length up to 512 words, we therefore split documents with more than 10 sentences into multiple blocks (each block with 10 sentences). We feed each block (the BOS and EOS tokens of each sentence are replaced with [CLS] and [SEP] tokens) into BERT and use the representation at [CLS] token to classify each sentence. Our model $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$1 outperforms BERT by 0.4 to 0.5 ROUGE despite with only half the number of model parameters ( $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$2 54.6M v.s. BERT 110M). Results on the NYT50 dataset show the similar trends (see Table 2 ). EXTRACTION is a extractive model based hierarchical LSTM and we use the numbers reported by xu:2019:arxiv. The improvement of $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$3 over the baseline without pre-training (HeriTransformer) becomes 2.0 ROUGE. $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$4 (in-domain), $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$5 (in-domain), $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$6 and $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$7 all outperform BERT significantly according to the ROUGE script.",No.,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.839838722567789,3.745318352059925,7.3018080667593885,0.0390625,0.0008326394671107,0.0651456788182258,0.12021055072546,0.0651456788182258,,0.0058270322316127,0.0683823823928833,3,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.6810437047195278,0.724159206282082,0.0,0.0683823823928833
86,86,How better are results compared to baseline models?,F1 score of best authors' model is 55.98 compared to BiLSTM and FastText that have F1 score slighlty higher than 46.61.,"We see that parent quality is a simple yet effective feature and SVM model with this feature can achieve significantly higher ($p<0.001$) F1 score ($46.61\%$) than distance from the thesis and linguistic features.

Although the BiLSTM model with attention and FastText baselines performs better than the SVM with distance from the thesis and linguistic features, it has similar performance to the parent quality baseline.
We find that the flat representation of the context achieves the highest F1 score. It may be more difficult for the models with a larger number of parameters to perform better than the flat representation since the dataset is small.

87,87,What geometric properties do embeddings display?,Winter and summer words formed two separate clusters. Week day and week-end day words also formed separate clusters.,"The initial analyses of the embedding matrices for both the UK and France revealed that in general, words were grouped by context or influence on the electricity consumption. For instance, we observed that winter words were together and far away from summer ones. Week days were grouped as well and far from week-end days. However considering the vocabulary was reduced to $V^* = 52$ words, those results lacked of consistency. Therefore for both languages we decided to re-train the RNNs using the same architecture, but with a larger vocabulary of the $V=300$ most relevant words (still in the RF sense) and on all the available data (i.e. everything is used as training) to compensate for the increased size of the vocabulary. We then calculated the distance of a few prominent words to the others. The analysis of the average cosine distance over $B=10$ runs for three major words is given by tables TABREF38 and TABREF39, and three other examples are given in the appendix tables TABREF57 and TABREF58. The first row corresponds to the reference word vector $\overrightarrow{w_1}$ used to calculate the distance from (thus the distance is always zero), while the following ones are the 9 closest to it. The two last rows correspond to words we deemed important to check the distance with (an antagonistic one or relevant one not in the top 9 for instance).",Geometric properties of embeddings display grouping by context or influence.,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.9146030690102511,15.03988663638642,12.264081226786557,0.0261780104712041,0.005524861878453,0.2176627069711685,0.408861674575342,0.2559913396835327,0.1927670985460281,0.004168981716921,0.04862966760993,3,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.988146890365162,0.7902189223578188,0.7608756894312748,0.8,0.04862966760993

Individually, the proposed system improves the existing F-scores for all the emotions except surprise. The findings of BIBREF15 also support this behavior (i.e. worst result for the surprise class). This could be attributed to the data scarcity and a very low agreement between the annotators for the emotion surprise.","BIBREF7, BIBREF39, LitisMind, BIBREF38, BIBREF37, and BIBREF15.",0.1599999959680001,0.0,0.1599999959680001,5.905575616757554,17.082106886080613,20.539906284943683,0.1413427561837456,0.0033222591362126,0.3138436377048492,0.0,0.3138435781002044,0.0,0.0235361273961649,0.0431492738425731,3,0.8333333333333334,1.0,1.0,0.8145615031888477,0.2916567800936709,0.7916271203746837,0.8,0.0431492738425731

93,93,How was quality measured?,"Inter-annotator agreement, comparison against expert annotation, agreement with PropBank Data annotations.","Dataset Quality Analysis ::: Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA)
To estimate dataset consistency across different annotations, we measure F1 using our UA metric with 5 generators per predicate. Individual worker-vs-worker agreement yields 79.8 F1 over 10 experiments with 150 predicates, indicating high consistency across our annotators, inline with results by other structured semantic annotations (e.g. BIBREF6). Overall consistency of the dataset is assessed by measuring agreement between different consolidated annotations, obtained by disjoint triplets of workers, which achieves F1 of 84.1 over 4 experiments, each with 35 distinct predicates. Notably, consolidation boosts agreement, suggesting it is a necessity for semantic annotation consistency.
Dataset Quality Analysis ::: Dataset Assessment and Comparison
We assess both our gold standard set and the recent Dense set against an integrated expert annotated sample of 100 predicates. To construct the expert set, we blindly merged the Dense set with our worker annotations and manually corrected them. We further corrected the evaluation decisions, accounting for some automatic evaluation mistakes introduced by the span-matching and question paraphrasing criteria. As seen in Table TABREF19, our gold set yields comparable precision with significantly higher recall, which is in line with our 25% higher yield.
Dataset Quality Analysis ::: Agreement with PropBank Data
It is illuminating to observe the agreement between QA-SRL and PropBank (CoNLL-2009) annotations BIBREF7. In Table TABREF22, we replicate the experiments in BIBREF4 for both our gold set and theirs, over a sample of 200 sentences from Wall Street Journal (agreement evaluation is automatic and the metric is somewhat similar to our UA). We report macro-averaged (over predicates) precision and recall for all roles, including core and adjuncts, while considering the PropBank data as the reference set.

94,94,What is different in the improved annotation protocol?,A trained worker consolidates existing annotations.,"We adopt the annotation machinery of BIBREF5 implemented using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and annotate each predicate by 2 trained workers independently, while a third consolidates their annotations into a final set of roles and arguments. In this consolidation task, the worker validates questions, merges, splits or modifies answers for the same role according to guidelines, and removes redundant roles by picking the more naturally phrased questions. For example, in Table TABREF4 ex. 1, one worker could have chosen “47 people”, while another chose “the councillor”; in this case the consolidator would include both of those answers.

Our experiments showed that using the objects color or shape to uniquely identify an object allows the robot successfully complete the binning task in 97.6% and 96.0% of the cases. However, using the shape alone as a unique identifier, the task could only be completed in 79.0% of the cases.

We considered that it was not a good metric to apply as in some occasions responses have the same meaning, but do not share any words in common.
