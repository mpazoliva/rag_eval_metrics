"In one of the examples in the paper, the longer rule gave validated fact check over short rule. Does that hinder your intuition?",No. The paper does not deal with NIL,the longer rule gave a validated fact check over the short rule in some examples but it doesn't hinder our intuition.,"A number of approaches specifically look into whether LMs can generalize from examples requiring shorter reasoning chains (shown to them either as demonstration or as finetuning data) to examples requiring longer chains Anil et al. (2022); Tafjord et al. (2020). With our model, length generalization comes for free because the model learns the building blocks of solving the problem that are applied as many times as needed to solve the problem. Note that once a set of rules \mathcal{R}_{s} are selected, the algorithm proceeds in a depth-first manner (i.e. it exhaustively verifies one rule before going to the next rule). Therefore, if the algorithm can start with the rules that have a higher chance of succeeding at proving or disproving the goal, it can save computations and be less error prone. In this paper, we use a heuristic to rank the rules: we sort them based on their lengths with shorter rules being ranked higher.This heuristic is based on the intuition that shorter rules are likely to have fewer sub-goals in their antecedent. We leave more sophisticated ranking strategies as future work."
Does prediction of Unknown values have an influence on proved and disproved?,To avoid discontinuous shape and loss of discriminative structures,The prediction of Unknown values does not have an influence on proved and disproved.,"The results for Lambada and the baselines on the two ProofWriter datasets are provided in Figure 1, and PrOntoQA results are shown in Figure 2. From the results, we observe that Lambada significantly outperforms the other two baselines, especially on ProofWriter-PUD which contains Unknown labels (44\% relative improvement compared to CoT and 56\% compared to SI on Depth-5) as well as on the higher depths of PrOntoQA (37\% relative improvement compared to CoT and 113\% compared to SI on Depth-5). These results show the merit of Lambada for logical reasoning and also show that backward chaining (which is the backbone of reasoning in Lambada) may be a better choice compared to forward chaining (the backbone in SI). The results also reveal a short-coming of the CoT approach in dealing with Unknown labels, as, unlike the examples for which the label is Proved or Disproved, there is no natural chain of thought for the examples whose labels are Unknown."
Will doing batch calls use cached values?,"Deep highway networks have the ability to smoothly vary their behavior between that of a layer that simply passes its inputs through and a layer that performs a complex computation, whereas plain networks have a fixed behavior. This allows deep highway networks to avoid the degradation in performance that is typically seen in deep plain networks. Additionally, deep highway networks can be trained more easily and with a lower computational budget than plain networks, and they generalize well to unseen data",Yes batch calls uses cache values.,"During a proof, Lambada may be called multiple times with the same theory and goal; in Appendix A we explain how cycles and redundant computations can be avoided using a cache."
Will results be similar for 5 hops?,"The seven input pixel channels represent the following features:

1. Image intensity in YUV color space (3 channels)
2. Depth channel of the image
3. X, Y, and Z components of surface normals computed based on the depth channel","No , the result substantially gets better with 5 hops","We conduct experiments with ProofWriter Tafjord et al. (2020) and PrOntoQA Saparov and He (2022) which are challenging datasets for LM reasoning containing examples requiring proof chains of up to 5 hops in length, and (in the former case) examples where the goal can neither be proved nor disproved from the provided theory. On these datasets, we show that Lambada has substantially higher deductive accuracy, and is considerably more likely to generate valid reasoning chains compared to other techniques which find correct conclusions with spurious proof traces, while also being more query efficient than other LM-based modular reasoning approaches. Our results strongly indicate that future work on reasoning with LMs should incorporate backward chaining or goal-directed strategies."
How can you come to the intuition that shorter rules have smaller sub goals?,"Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) is a step in the SSD object detection algorithm where the output bounding boxes and scores are filtered to retain only the most likely detections, based on a threshold value. This helps to reduce the number of false positives and improve the accuracy of the detections","If smaller LMs are utilised, then one may need to split the issue into sub-problems even more (e.g., further decomposing the one-to-many comparisons in the selection module) (e.g., further decomposing the one-to-many comparisons in the selection module)","We argue that the extent to which reasoning algorithms break the problem into sub-problem should be dependent on the scale and power of the LMs. If smaller LMs are used, then one may need to break the problem into sub-problems even further (e.g., further decomposing the one-to-many comparisons in the selection module). And as LMs become larger and stronger in the future, one could rely on them to solve problems even with a coarser-grained decomposition of the problem."
How is it better to decrease the depth by 1 over other values?,"An adversarial perturbation refers to a minimal perturbation of the data that is sufficient to change the estimated label of a classifier, and is used to study the robustness of the classifier to small, imperceptible changes in the data",Decreasing the depth by 1 requires fewer calls as compared to other values.,"Lambada and SI require multiple LM inference call per example. In Figure 5, we compare the two models with respect to the average number of inference calls they make to the LM per example, for the different depths of the ProofWriter-PUD dataset. We observe that Lambada requires significantly fewer inference calls, especially at higher depths. For example, for Depth-1, Lambada requires 3.8x fewer calls whereas for Depth-5 it requires 11.8x fewer calls."
"Are the results similar for other variants of values, given test set has only 1000 examples?","To maintain a small total number of parameters in a CNN, the authors use a mix of 1x1 and 3x3 filters in the expand layer of the Fire module, as described in Strategy 2 of Section 3.1. By using 1x1 filters, the number of input channels to the 3x3 filters is decreased, which helps to limit the total number of parameters in the layer","Yes, the results are similar for other variants of values.","For higher depths (3+), on the three datasets SI produces predictions that are close to the majority class prediction. We find that it tends to over-predict Disproved in the binary case and Unknown in the three-way classification case (cf. Appendix B.3), making it perform even worse than the majority class for Depth-5 of PrOntoQA which has more Proved labels than Disproved. However, we surprisingly observe that the performance of CoT remains relatively high for the ProofWriter-PD dataset, and the accuracy does not diminish. In the next sub-section, we verify the reason for this behaviour of CoT. For Fact Check, we randomly selected 100 examples from the Depth-0 examples.For Rule Selection, we randomly selected 100 examples and manually enumerated every rule whose consequent unifies with the goal. A model prediction is considered correct if it predicts all such rules correctly. For Goal Decomposition, we randomly selected 100 rules and goals such that the consequent of the rule unifies with the goal and then manually wrote the sub-goals. A model prediction is considered correct if it predicts all the sub-goals correctly. For Sign Agreement, we re-used the same examples from the Goal Decomposition module and manually labeled them with respect to their sign agreement/disagreement."
Doesn’t the possibility of having many rules make it ambiguous?,The range of the number of parameters for the models used in the study is from 5 thousand to 160 million,"No, the possibility of having many rules does not make it ambiguous.","In the case where we succeed in proving the antecedent of r, whether the goal is proved or disproved depends on whether the sign of the goal agrees or disagrees with the sign of the consequent of r. For instance, in Example 2, for the goal ‘‘Fiona is red?’’, since the sign of the goal agreed with the sign of the consequent of the second rule and the antecedent of the rule was proved, we concluded that the goal is proved. However, if the second rule was ‘‘Rough, nice people are not red.’’, then the sign of the goal would disagree with the sign of the consequent and so we would conclude that the goal is disproved. This motivates the fourth module, Sign Agreement, described next. The above results show that the Rule Selection and Goal Decomposition modules are responsible for the majority of the failure cases. Note that it is possible that the Rule Selection module fails for some examples but Lambada still arrives at the correct conclusion and proof. For the theory and goal in Example 1, for example, if there was another rule whose consequent was ‘‘being red’’ and the Rule Selection module failed to select that rule, Lambada would still arrive at the correct proof and prediction."
"Given the triggered sentences, how can this problem be rectified?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

To reduce computational cost.

Inception-v4's use of average pooling instead of max pooling in its inception module is a deliberate design choice aimed at reducing computational cost. By using average pooling, the model can capture local features more efficiently and with less computational overhead, which is particularly important in the early stages of the network","The triggered sentence is ""One solution to the aforementioned problems is to integrate the strength and reliability of classical AI models in logical reasoning with LMs Garcez and Lamb "".","One solution to the aforementioned problems is to integrate the strength and reliability of classical AI models in logical reasoning with LMs Garcez and Lamb (2020); Marcus (2020).In the classic literature, there are two major approaches to logical reasoning Poole and Mackworth (2010):1.Forward Chaining (FC) where one starts from the facts and rules (“theory”), and iterates between making new inferences and adding them to the theory until the goal statement can be proved or disproved,2.Backward Chaining (BC) where one starts from the goal and recursively decomposes it into sub-goals until the sub-goals can be proved or disproved based on the facts.Previous approaches to reasoning with LMs mostly incorporate elements of FC into LMs Tafjord et al. (2020); Creswell et al. (2022). FC requires selecting a subset of facts and rules from the entire set which might be difficult for an LM as it requires a combinatorial search over a large space.Moreover, deciding when to halt and declare failure to prove is challenging in FC Creswell et al. (2022), sometimes requiring specialized modules trained on intermediate labels Creswell and Shanahan (2022). Indeed, the classic automated reasoning literature is heavily weighted towards BC or goal-directed strategies for proof-finding."
Doesn’t breaking the problem into sub problems increase computation?,Truncated SVD,"Yes, breaking the problem into sub-problems increases computation.","These approaches break the problem into smaller modules and use separate LMs to solve each module Zhou et al. (2022b); Khot et al. (2022); Sprague et al. (2022); Zhou et al. (2022a).Most relevant to our work,in Tafjord et al. (2020), a single LM module iteratively and exhaustively derives all conclusions based on the facts and rules, and then the goal statement is checked against the final set of conclusions to confirm if it can be proved from the theory. Since exhaustively deriving all conclusions is computationally expensive, Creswell et al. (2022) consider an alternative approach with two modules: 1- selection, which, guided by the goal, selects a subset of the facts and rules from which new conclusions can be derived toward proving the goal, and 2- inference, which takes the selected facts and rules and derives a new conclusion. The two modules are called iteratively until a halting criterion is met. In this paper, we compare against the second approach."
How trustworthy are the ML decisions made by the system?,"The proposed model's data preparation is similar to SRCNN, but with a fixed input patch size equal to the receptive field size and no overlap between sub-images","How trustworthy are ML decisions depends on many factors. Human understanding and trust in ML concerns not only understanding promoted decisions, but also, evaluating these decisions in relation to limitations built into the ML model. Limitations are introduced in ML systems by humans during the design phase. The approach towards understanding ML decisions builds on connecting human understandable concepts to the ML models knowledge representations with the goal of making them explicable. We here view contemporary ML as limited to local generalization within a single task or well-deﬁned set of tasks that only holds when the training data used is independent- and-identically-distributed (i.i.d). ML is then limited when this does not hold or when it comes to causal inference and out-of-distribution (o.o.d) generalization.","We here view contemporary ML as limited to local gen- eralisation within a single task or well-deﬁned set of tasks that only holds when the training data used is independent- and-identically-distributed (i.i.d). ML is then limited when this does not hold or when it comes to causal inference and out-of-distribution (o.o.d) generalisation (Chollet 2019; Scholkopf et al. 2021). Human understanding and trust in ML concerns not only understanding promoted decisions 1 , but also, evaluating these decisions in relation to limitations built into the ML model. Limitations are introduced in ML systems by hu- mans during the design phase, for example; what to model, choice of algorithm, feature engineering, training data se- lection (Gillies et al. 2016). The need for explanations to convey understanding is pronounced in more complex ML models (Lipton 2016) and especially prominent in today’s dominating technology: neural networks. Our approach towards understanding ML decisions builds on connecting human understandable concepts to the ML models knowledge representations with the goal of making them explicable. Below follows an outline of the perspect- ives on explanations used in this paper."
How are other questions handled?,"Large annotated 3D data is lacking, and effective methods for extracting deep features of 3D faces remain to be explored","What if -questions and the centrality of concepts is the focus for this review where we examine how concepts are extracted from a neural network.

Did the authors use commonly used one-vs-all scheme for extending DeepFool method to the multiclass case?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

No","Yes, the authors use the common one-vs-all scheme \hat{k}(\bm{x})=\operatorname*{arg\,max}_{k}f_{k}(\bm{x}).","We now extend the DeepFool algorithm to the general case of multiclass differentiable classifiers. For general non-linear classifiers, the set P in Eq. (7) that describes the region of the space where the classifier outputs label \hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0}) is no longer a polyhedron. Following the explained iterative linearization procedure in the binary case, we approximate the set P at iteration i by a polyhedron \tilde{P}_{i}P~i=⋂k=1c{\displaystyle\tilde{P}_{i}=\bigcap_{k=1}^{c}\Big{\{}over~ start_ARG italic_P end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ⋂ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT {\displaystyle\bm{x}:f_{k}(\bm{x}_{i})-f_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}(\bm{x}_{i})(10)+∇fk(𝒙i)⊤𝒙−∇fk^⁢(𝒙0)(𝒙i)⊤𝒙≤0}.\displaystyle+\nabla f_{k}(\bm{x}_{i})^{\top}\bm{x}-\nabla f_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}(\bm{x}_{i})^{\top}\bm{x}\leq 0\Big{\}}.+ ∇ italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⊤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT bold_italic_x - ∇ italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT over^ start_ARG italic_k end_ARG ( bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⊤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT bold_italic_x ≤ 0 } .We then approximate, at iteration i, the distance between \bm{x}_{i} and the complement of P, \text{{dist}}(\bm{x}_{i},P^{c}), by \text{{dist}}(\bm{x}_{i},\tilde{P}_{i}^{c}). Specifically, at each iteration of the algorithm, the perturbation vector that reaches the boundary of the polyhedron \tilde{P}_{i} is computed, and the current estimate updated.The method is given in Algorithm 2. It should be noted that the proposed algorithm operates in a greedy way and is not guaranteed to converge to the optimal perturbation in (1). However, we have observed in practice that our algorithm yields very small perturbations which are believed to be good approximations of the minimal perturbation.  We now extend the DeepFool method to the multiclass case. The most common used scheme for multiclass classifiers is one-vs-all. Hence, we also propose our method based on this classification scheme. In this scheme, the classifier has c outputs where c is the number of classes. Therefore, a classifier can be defined as f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{c} and the classification is done by the following mapping:\hat{k}(\bm{x})=\operatorname*{arg\,max}_{k}f_{k}(\bm{x}),(5)where f_{k}(\bm{x}) is the output of f(\bm{x}) that corresponds to the k^{\text{th}} class.Similarly to the binary case, we first present the proposed approach for the linear case and then we generalize it to other classifiers."
How is the authors' work different from the “fast gradient sign” method?,"Sure, I can answer your questions based on the given context!

Using CLIP-based codes means using codes generated by the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to condition the image inversion process. This is a limitation because it only applies to the specific method used in DALL-E 2, which relies on CLIP-based codes to condition the model. Other methods may not be able to use these codes, and therefore may not be able to achieve the same level of image manipulation.

In other words, CLIP-based codes are a specific type of conditioning that is only applicable to the DALL-E 2 method, and other methods may not be able to use the same approach. This is why the authors note that their method may not be applicable to other methods","The fast gradient sign method is very quick but may lead to sub-optimal perturbations thus damaging the overall robustness estimation, and fine-tuning with such adversarial samples may sometimes result in a drop in the overall performance of the model. On the other hand, DeepFool creates adversarial perturbations that are closer to the absolute minimum compared to others thus giving us a more reliable tool in terms of robustness estimation and fine-tuning.","We compare the proposed DeepFool approach to state-of-the-art techniques to compute adversarial perturbations in [18] and [4]. The method in [18] solves a series of penalized optimization problems to find the minimal perturbation, whereas [4] estimates the minimal perturbation by taking the sign of the gradient\displaystyle\hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x})=\epsilon\,\text{sign}\left(\nabla_{\bm{x}}J(\bm{\theta},\bm{x},y)\right),with J the cost used to train the neural network, \bm{\theta} is the model parameters, and y is the label of \bm{x}. The method is called fast gradient sign method. In practice, in the absence of general rules to choose the parameter \epsilon, we chose the smallest \epsilon such that 90\% of the data are misclassified after perturbation.555Using this method, we observed empirically that one cannot reach 100\% misclassification rate on some datasets. In fact, even by increasing \epsilon to be very large, this method can fail in misclassifying all samples. It can be seen that DeepFool estimates smaller perturbations (hence closer to minimal perturbation defined in (1)) than the ones computed using the competitive approaches. For example, the average perturbation obtained using DeepFool is 5 times lower than the one estimated with [4]. On the ILSVRC2012 challenge dataset, the average perturbation is one order of magnitude smaller compared to the fast gradient method. It should be noted moreover that the proposed approach also yields slightly smaller perturbation vectors than the method in [18]. The proposed approach is hence more accurate in detecting directions that can potentially fool neural networks. As a result, DeepFool can be used as a valuable tool to accurately assess the robustness of classifiers.On the complexity aspect, the proposed approach is substantially faster than the standard method proposed in [18].In fact, while the approach [18] involves a costly minimization of a series of objective functions, we observed empirically that DeepFool converges in a few iterations (i.e., less than 3) to a perturbation vector that fools the classifier. Hence, the proposed approach reaches a more accurate perturbation vector compared to state-of-the-art methods, while being computationally efficient. This makes it readily suitable to be used as a baseline method to estimate the robustness of very deep neural networks on large-scale datasets. In that context, we provide the first quantitative evaluation of the robustness of state-of-the-art classifiers on the large-scale ImageNet dataset. It can be seen that despite their very good test accuracy, these methods are extremely unstable to adversarial perturbations: a perturbation that is 1000 smaller in magnitude than the original image is sufficient to fool state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We illustrate in Figure 1 perturbed images generated by the fast gradient sign and DeepFool. It can be observed that the proposed method generates adversarial perturbations which are hardly perceptible, while the fast gradient sign method outputs a perturbation image with higher norm. In this section, we fine-tune the networks of Table 1 on adversarial examples to build more robust classifiers for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. Specifically, for each network, we performed two experiments: (i) Fine-tuning the network on DeepFool’s adversarial examples, (ii) Fine-tuning the network on the fast gradient sign adversarial examples.We fine-tune the networks by performing 5 additional epochs, with a 50\% decreased learning rate only on the perturbed training set. For each experiment, the same training data was used through all 5 extra epochs. For the sake of completeness, we also performed 5 extra epochs on the original data. The evolution of \hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}} for the different fine-tuning strategies is shown in Figures 5(a) to 5(d), where the robustness \hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}} is estimated using DeepFool, since this is the most accurate method, as shown in Table 1. Observe that fine-tuning with DeepFool adversarial examples significantly increases the robustness of the networks to adversarial perturbations even after one extra epoch. For example, the robustness of the networks on MNIST is improved by 50% and NIN’s robustness is increased by about 40%. On the other hand, quite surprisingly, the method in [4] can lead to a decreased robustness to adversarial perturbations of the network. We hypothesize that this behavior is due to the fact that perturbations estimated using the fast gradient sign method are much larger than minimal adversarial perturbations. Fine-tuning the network with overly perturbed images decreases the robustness of the networks to adversarial perturbations.To verify this hypothesis, we compare in Figure 7 the adversarial robustness of a network that is fine-tuned with the adversarial examples obtained using DeepFool, where norms of perturbations have been deliberately multiplied by \alpha=1,2,3. Interestingly, we see that by magnifying the norms of the adversarial perturbations, the robustness of the fine-tuned network is decreased. This might explain why overly perturbed images decrease the robustness of MNIST networks: these perturbations can really change the class of the digits, hence fine-tuning based on these examples can lead to a drop of the robustness (for an illustration, see Figure 8). This lends credence to our hypothesis, and further shows the importance of designing accurate methods to compute minimal perturbations. Table 3 lists the accuracies of the fine-tuned networks. It can be seen that fine-tuning with DeepFool can improve the accuracy of the networks. Conversely, fine-tuning with the approach in [4] has led to a decrease of the test accuracy in all our experiments. This confirms the explanation that the fast gradient sign method outputs overly perturbed images that lead to images that are unlikely to occur in the test data. Hence, it decreases the performance of the method as it acts as a regularizer that does not represent the distribution of the original data. This effect is analogous to geometric data augmentation schemes, where large transformations of the original samples have a counter-productive effect on generalization.666While the authors of [4] reported an increased generalization performance on the MNIST task (from 0.94\% to 0.84\%) using adversarial regularization, it should be noted that the their experimental setup is significantly different as [4] trained the network based on a modified cost function, while we performed straightforward fine-tuning. To emphasize the importance of a correct estimation of the minimal perturbation, we now show that using approximate methods can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the adversarial robustness of networks. We fine-tune the NIN classifier on the fast gradient sign adversarial examples. We follow the procedure described earlier but this time, we decreased the learning rate by 90%. We have evaluated the adversarial robustness of this network at different extra epochs using DeepFool and the fast gradient sign method. As one can see in Figure 9, the red plot exaggerates the effect of training on the adversarial examples. Moreover, it is not sensitive enough to demonstrate the loss of robustness at the first extra epoch. These observations confirm that using an accurate tool to measure the robustness of classifiers is crucial to derive conclusions about the robustness of networks.  Our main contributions are the following:•We propose a simple yet accurate method for computing and comparing the robustness of different classifiers to adversarial perturbations.•We perform an extensive experimental comparison, and show that 1) our method computes adversarial perturbations more reliably and efficiently than existing methods 2) augmenting training data with adversarial examples significantly increases the robustness to adversarial perturbations.•We show that using imprecise approaches for the computation of adversarial perturbations could lead to different and sometimes misleading conclusions about the robustness. Hence, our method provides a better understanding of this intriguing phenomenon and of its influence factors.We now review some of the relevant work. The phenomenon of adversarial instability was first introduced and studied in [18]. The authors estimated adversarial examples by solving penalized optimization problems and presented an analysis showing that the high complexity of neural networks might be a reason explaining the presence of adversarial examples. Unfortunately, the optimization method employed in [18] is time-consuming and therefore does not scale to large datasets. In [14], the authors showed that convolutional networks are not invariant to some sort of transformations based on the experiments done on Pascal3D+ annotations. Recently, Tsai et al. [19] provided a software to misclassify a given image in a specified class, without necessarily finding the smallest perturbation. Nguyen et al. [13] generated synthetic unrecognizable images, which are classified with high confidence. The authors of [3] also studied a related problem of finding the minimal geometric transformation that fools image classifiers, and provided quantitative measure of the robustness of classifiers to geometric transformations. Closer to our work, the authors of [4] introduced the “fast gradient sign” method, which computes the adversarial perturbations for a given classifier very efficiently. Despite its efficiency, this method provides only a coarse approximation of the optimal perturbation vectors. In fact, it performs a unique gradient step, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions. Then in an attempt to build more robust classifiers to adversarial perturbations, [5] introduced a smoothness penalty in the training procedure that allows to boost the robustness of the classifier. Notably, the method in [18] was applied in order to generate adversarial perturbations. We should finally mention that the phenomenon of adversarial instability also led to theoretical work in [2] that studied the problem of adversarial perturbations on some families of classifiers, and provided upper bounds on the robustness of these classifiers. A deeper understanding of the phenomenon of adversarial instability for more complex classifiers is however needed; the method proposed in this work can be seen as a baseline to efficiently and accurately generate adversarial perturbations in order to better understand this phenomenon."
"What does an ""adversarial perturbation"" mean?",No,Adversarial perturbation is a small and unnoticeable change to the data that fool the given model (i.e give a different class after applying the perturbation). It allows an understanding limits of existing architectures and calculation of the robustness of the models.,"Deep neural networks are powerful learning models that achieve state-of-the-art pattern recognition performance in many research areas such as bioinformatics [1, 16], speech [12, 6], and computer vision [10, 8]. Though deep networks have exhibited very good performance in classification tasks, they have recently been shown to be particularly unstable to adversarial perturbations of the data [18]. In fact, very small and often imperceptible perturbations of the data samples are sufficient to fool state-of-the-art classifiers and result in incorrect classification. (e.g., Figure 1). Formally, for a given classifier, we define an adversarial perturbation as the minimal perturbation \bm{r} that is sufficient to change the estimated label \hat{k}(\bm{x}):\displaystyle\Delta(\bm{x};\hat{k}):=\min_{\bm{r}}\|\bm{r}\|_{2}\text{ subject to }\hat{k}(\bm{x}+\bm{r})\neq\hat{k}(\bm{x}),(1)where \bm{x} is an image and \hat{k}(\bm{x}) is the estimated label. We call \Delta(\bm{x};\hat{k}) the robustness of \hat{k} at point \bm{x}. The robustness of classifier \hat{k} is then defined as \rho_{\text{adv}}(\hat{k})=\mathbb{E}_{\bm{x}}\frac{\Delta(\bm{x};\hat{k})}{\|\bm{x}\|_{2}},(2)where \mathbb{E}_{\bm{x}} is the expectation over the distribution of data.The study of adversarial perturbations helps us understand what features are used by a classifier.The existence of such examples is seemingly in contradiction with the generalization ability of the learning algorithms. While deep networks achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks, they are not robust at all to small adversarial perturbations and tend to misclassify minimally perturbed data that looks visually similar to clean samples.Though adversarial attacks are specific to the classifier, it seems that the adversarial perturbations are generalizable across different models [18]. This can actually become a real concern from a security point of view. An accurate method for finding the adversarial perturbations is thus necessary to study and compare the robustness of different classifiers to adversarial perturbations. It might be the key to a better understanding of the limits of current architectures and to design methods to increase robustness. Despite the importance of the vulnerability of state-of-the-art classifiers to adversarial instability, no well-founded method has been proposed to compute adversarial perturbations and we fill this gap in this paper."
What are the metrics used to compare the efficiency of different methods which compute the adversarial perturbations?,300,The metrics that are used to compare different methods of finding adversarial perturbations are: the average robustness of the model estimated in some type of norm (2-norm or infinity-norm in the paper); and the average running time needed to find the estimated minimal perturbation.,"In order to evaluate the robustness to adversarial perturbations of a classifier f, we compute the average robustness \hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}}(f), defined by\hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}}(f)=\frac{1}{|\mathscr{D}|}\sum_{\bm{x}\in\mathscr{D}}\frac{\|\hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x})\|_{2}}{\|\bm{x}\|_{2}},(15)where \hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x}) is the estimated minimal perturbation obtained using DeepFool, and \mathscr{D} denotes the test set444For ILSVRC2012, we used the validation data.. We report in Table 1 the accuracy and average robustness \hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}} of each classifier computed using different methods. We also show the running time required for each method to compute one adversarial sample. It should be noted that, when perturbations are measured using the \ell_{\infty} norm, the above conclusions remain unchanged: DeepFool yields adversarial perturbations that are smaller (hence closer to the optimum) compared to other methods for computing adversarial examples. Table 2 reports the \ell_{\infty} robustness to adversarial perturbations measured by \hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}}^{\infty}(f)=\frac{1}{|\mathscr{D}|}\sum_{\bm{x}\in\mathscr{D}}\frac{\|\hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x})\|_{\infty}}{\|\bm{x}\|_{\infty}}, where \hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x}) is computed respectively using DeepFool (with p=\infty, see Section 3.3), and the Fast gradient sign method for MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. To emphasize the importance of a correct estimation of the minimal perturbation, we now show that using approximate methods can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the adversarial robustness of networks. We fine-tune the NIN classifier on the fast gradient sign adversarial examples. We follow the procedure described earlier but this time, we decreased the learning rate by 90%. We have evaluated the adversarial robustness of this network at different extra epochs using DeepFool and the fast gradient sign method. As one can see in Figure 9, the red plot exaggerates the effect of training on the adversarial examples. Moreover, it is not sensitive enough to demonstrate the loss of robustness at the first extra epoch. These observations confirm that using an accurate tool to measure the robustness of classifiers is crucial to derive conclusions about the robustness of networks. "
"What does an ""affine classifier"" mean?",RELU6 differs from vanilla RELU in its robustness when used with low-precision computation,"The affine classifier is the classifier in the form of an affine function. The general form that is used in the paper is the function f: R^n -> R^m, where f(x) = W^T * x + B, for the given matrix and vector W and B.","Let f(\bm{x}) be an affine classifier, i.e., f(\bm{x})=\mathbf{W}^{\top}\bm{x}+\bm{b} for a given \mathbf{W} and \bm{b}. Since the mapping \hat{k} is the outcome of a one-vs-all classification scheme, the minimal perturbation to fool the classifier can be rewritten as follows\begin{split}&\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\bm{r}}\|\bm{r}\|_{2}\\&\text{s.t. }\exists k:\bm{w}_{k}^{\top}(\bm{x}_{0}+\bm{r})+b_{k}\geq\bm{w}_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}^{\top}(\bm{x}_{0}+\bm{r})+b_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})},\end{split}(6)where \bm{w}_{k} is the k^{\text{th}} column of \mathbf{W}. Geometrically, the above problem corresponds to the computation of the distance between \bm{x}_{0} and the complement of the convex polyhedron P,\displaystyle P=\bigcap_{k=1}^{c}\{\bm{x}:f_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}(\bm{x})\geq f_{k}(\bm{x})\},(7)where \bm{x}_{0} is located inside P.We denote this distance by \text{{dist}}(\bm{x}_{0},P^{c}).The polyhedron P defines the region of the space where f outputs the label \hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0}). This setting is depicted in Figure 4. The solution to the problem in Eq. (6) can be computed in closed form as follows. Define \hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0}) to be the closest hyperplane of the boundary of P (e.g. \hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0})=3 in Figure 4). Formally, \hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0}) can be computed as follows\hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0})=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{k\neq{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}}\frac{\left|f_{k}(\bm{x}_{0})-f_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}(\bm{x}_{0})\right|}{\|\bm{w}_{k}-\bm{w}_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}\|_{2}}.(8)The minimum perturbation \bm{r}_{*}(\bm{x}_{0}) is the vector that projects \bm{x}_{0} on the hyperplane indexed by \hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0}), i.e.,\bm{r}_{*}(\bm{x}_{0})=\frac{\left|f_{\hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0})}(\bm{x}_{0})-f_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}(\bm{x}_{0})\right|}{\|\bm{w}_{\hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0})}-\bm{w}_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}\|_{2}^{2}}(\bm{w}_{\hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0})}-\bm{w}_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}).(9)In other words, we find the closest projection of \bm{x}_{0} on faces of P. As a multiclass classifier can be viewed as aggregation of binary classifiers, we first propose the algorithm for binary classifiers.That is, we assume here \hat{k}(\bm{x})=\text{sign}(f(\bm{x})), where f is an arbitrary scalar-valued image classification function f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}. We also denote by \mathscr{F}\triangleq\{\bm{x}:f(\bm{x})=0\} the level set at zero of f.We begin by analyzing the case where f is an affine classifier f(\bm{x})=\bm{w}^{T}\bm{x}+b, and then derive the general algorithm, which can be applied to any differentiable binary classifier f."
What is the value of η used by the authors in experimentation?,"Learning a task-oriented dialogue agent is different from the problems in the RL domain because the natural language action space is astronomical, while feasible actions are very sparse, making it challenging to learn an optimal dialogue strategy",The perturbation constant that is used is n = 0.02.,"In practice, the above algorithm can often converge to a point on the zero level set \mathscr{F}. In order to reach the other side of the classification boundary, the final perturbation vector \hat{\bm{r}} is multiplied by a constant 1+\eta, with \eta\ll 1. In our experiments, we have used \eta=0.02. "
"The paper's algorithm yields very small perturbations which are believed to be good approximations of the minimal perturbation. Quantitatively, how far is the paper's approximation from the minimal perturbation?",Masking out less relevant tokens helps the model learn more task-relevant information and avoid reward hacking,"The authors only claim that the DeepFool can be used as a baseline for adversarial perturbation calculation and that it heavily depends on existing optimization methods. In the paper, its effectiveness is proven relative to other state-of-the-art methods. Although the analysis of how far the estimated perturbation from the actual minimal perturbation can be found in referenced papers, the more sophisticated analysis is not mentioned in the paper. Thus, it is difficult to answer the question entirely.","It can be seen that DeepFool estimates smaller perturbations (hence closer to minimal perturbation defined in (1)) than the ones computed using the competitive approaches. For example, the average perturbation obtained using DeepFool is 5 times lower than the one estimated with [4]. On the ILSVRC2012 challenge dataset, the average perturbation is one order of magnitude smaller compared to the fast gradient method. It should be noted moreover that the proposed approach also yields slightly smaller perturbation vectors than the method in [18]. The proposed approach is hence more accurate in detecting directions that can potentially fool neural networks. As a result, DeepFool can be used as a valuable tool to accurately assess the robustness of classifiers.On the complexity aspect, the proposed approach is substantially faster than the standard method proposed in [18].In fact, while the approach [18] involves a costly minimization of a series of objective functions, we observed empirically that DeepFool converges in a few iterations (i.e., less than 3) to a perturbation vector that fools the classifier. Hence, the proposed approach reaches a more accurate perturbation vector compared to state-of-the-art methods, while being computationally efficient. This makes it readily suitable to be used as a baseline method to estimate the robustness of very deep neural networks on large-scale datasets. In that context, we provide the first quantitative evaluation of the robustness of state-of-the-art classifiers on the large-scale ImageNet dataset. It can be seen that despite their very good test accuracy, these methods are extremely unstable to adversarial perturbations: a perturbation that is 1000 smaller in magnitude than the original image is sufficient to fool state-of-the-art deep neural networks. It should be noted that, when perturbations are measured using the \ell_{\infty} norm, the above conclusions remain unchanged: DeepFool yields adversarial perturbations that are smaller (hence closer to the optimum) compared to other methods for computing adversarial examples. Table 2 reports the \ell_{\infty} robustness to adversarial perturbations measured by \hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}}^{\infty}(f)=\frac{1}{|\mathscr{D}|}\sum_{\bm{x}\in\mathscr{D}}\frac{\|\hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x})\|_{\infty}}{\|\bm{x}\|_{\infty}}, where \hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x}) is computed respectively using DeepFool (with p=\infty, see Section 3.3), and the Fast gradient sign method for MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. Our main contributions are the following:•We propose a simple yet accurate method for computing and comparing the robustness of different classifiers to adversarial perturbations.•We perform an extensive experimental comparison, and show that 1) our method computes adversarial perturbations more reliably and efficiently than existing methods 2) augmenting training data with adversarial examples significantly increases the robustness to adversarial perturbations.•We show that using imprecise approaches for the computation of adversarial perturbations could lead to different and sometimes misleading conclusions about the robustness. Hence, our method provides a better understanding of this intriguing phenomenon and of its influence factors.We now review some of the relevant work. The phenomenon of adversarial instability was first introduced and studied in [18]. The authors estimated adversarial examples by solving penalized optimization problems and presented an analysis showing that the high complexity of neural networks might be a reason explaining the presence of adversarial examples. Unfortunately, the optimization method employed in [18] is time-consuming and therefore does not scale to large datasets. In [14], the authors showed that convolutional networks are not invariant to some sort of transformations based on the experiments done on Pascal3D+ annotations. Recently, Tsai et al. [19] provided a software to misclassify a given image in a specified class, without necessarily finding the smallest perturbation. Nguyen et al. [13] generated synthetic unrecognizable images, which are classified with high confidence. The authors of [3] also studied a related problem of finding the minimal geometric transformation that fools image classifiers, and provided quantitative measure of the robustness of classifiers to geometric transformations. Closer to our work, the authors of [4] introduced the “fast gradient sign” method, which computes the adversarial perturbations for a given classifier very efficiently. Despite its efficiency, this method provides only a coarse approximation of the optimal perturbation vectors. In fact, it performs a unique gradient step, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions. Then in an attempt to build more robust classifiers to adversarial perturbations, [5] introduced a smoothness penalty in the training procedure that allows to boost the robustness of the classifier. Notably, the method in [18] was applied in order to generate adversarial perturbations. We should finally mention that the phenomenon of adversarial instability also led to theoretical work in [2] that studied the problem of adversarial perturbations on some families of classifiers, and provided upper bounds on the robustness of these classifiers. A deeper understanding of the phenomenon of adversarial instability for more complex classifiers is however needed; the method proposed in this work can be seen as a baseline to efficiently and accurately generate adversarial perturbations in order to better understand this phenomenon. In practice, the above algorithm can often converge to a point on the zero level set \mathscr{F}. In order to reach the other side of the classification boundary, the final perturbation vector \hat{\bm{r}} is multiplied by a constant 1+\eta, with \eta\ll 1. In our experiments, we have used \eta=0.02.  It should be noted that the optimization strategy of DeepFool is strongly tied to existing optimization techniques. In the binary case, it can be seen as Newton’s iterative algorithm for finding roots of a nonlinear system of equations in the underdetermined case [15]. This algorithm is known as the normal flow method. The convergence analysis of this optimization technique can be found for example in [21]. Our algorithm in the binary case can alternatively be seen as a gradient descent algorithm with an adaptive step size that is automatically chosen at each iteration. The linearization in Algorithm 2 is also similar to a sequential convex programming where the constraints are linearized at each step."
Why did the authors choose a greedy approach for general classifier?,NO,"The DeepFool method is designed iteratively starting from very simple binary classifiers to more general non-linear differentiable classifiers. The effectiveness of the greedy algorithm is justified by previous work and the results show very small perturbations, thus the authors claim that it is a viable method. However, it is difficult to answer the question fully just from the information in the paper.","We then approximate, at iteration i, the distance between xi and the complement of P , dist(xi, P c), by dist(xi,  ̃P c i ). Specifically, at each iteration of the algorithm, the perturbation vector that reaches the boundary of the polyhedron  ̃Pi is computed, and the current estimate updated. The method is given in Algorithm 2. It should be noted that the proposed algorithm operates in a greedy way and is not guaranteed to converge to the optimal perturbation in (1). However, we have observed in practice that our algorithm yields very small perturbations which are believed to be good approximations of the minimal perturbation. It should be noted that the optimization strategy of DeepFool is strongly tied to existing optimization techniques. In the binary case, it can be seen as Newton’s iterative algorithm for finding roots of a nonlinear system of equations in the underdetermined case [15]. This algorithm is known as the normal flow method. The convergence analysis of this optimization technique can be found for example in [21]. Our algorithm in the binary case can alternatively be seen as a gradient descent algorithm with an adaptive step size that is automatically chosen at each iteration. The linearization in Algorithm 2 is also similar to a sequential convex programming where the constraints are linearized at each step."
Which deep neural network architectures were used for experimental comparison of DeepFool algorithm with existing methods?,"A synset is a set of words or phrases with similar meanings, as defined in WordNet","Although the conclusion of the paper claims that 8 different classifiers were used, we can only see 6 classifiers with different datasets: 2-layer fully-connected network (MNIST), 2-layer LeNet (MNIST), 3-layer LeNet (CIFAR-10), NIN (CIFAR-10), CaffeNet (ILSVRC 2012), and GoogLeNet (ILSVRC 2012).","We now test our DeepFool algorithm on deep convolutional neural networks architectures applied to MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet image classification datasets. We consider the following deep neural network architectures:•MNIST: A two-layer fully connected network, and a two-layer LeNet convoluational neural network architecture [9]. Both networks are trained with SGD with momentum using the MatConvNet [20] package.•CIFAR-10: We trained a three-layer LeNet architecture, as well as a Network In Network (NIN) architecture [11].•ILSVRC 2012: We used CaffeNet [7] and GoogLeNet [17] pre-trained models. In this work, we proposed an algorithm, DeepFool, to compute adversarial examples that fool state-of-the-art classifiers. It is based on an iterative linearization of the classifier to generate minimal perturbations that are sufficient to change classification labels. We provided extensive experimental evidence on three datasets and eight classifiers, showing the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods to compute adversarial perturbations, as well as the efficiency of the proposed approach. Due to its accurate estimation of the adversarial perturbations, the proposed DeepFool algorithm provides an efficient and accurate way to evaluate the robustness of classifiers and to enhance their performance by proper fine-tuning.The proposed approach can therefore be used as a reliable tool to accurately estimate the minimal perturbation vectors, and build more robust classifiers."
Why did the authors measure the perturbations using the L`2 norm?,"A linear sweep in hyperparameter space refers to a gradual increase or decrease in the value of a hyperparameter, starting from a minimum or maximum value, respectively, and ending at the opposite extreme","The authors claim that the DeepFool algorithm is a well-founded baseline for finding adversarial perturbations for state-of-the-art models. Although the use of the l-2 norm is not explicitly justified within the paper, it is a reasonable choice taking into account the scarcity of baseline methods. Also, the method can be easily adapted to any l-p norm and the claims of the paper seem to hold for the l-infinity norm.","In this paper, we have measured the perturbations using the \ell_{2} norm. Our framework is however not limited to this choice, and the proposed algorithm can simply be adapted to find minimal adversarial perturbations for any \ell_{p} norm (p\in[1,\infty)). To do so, the update steps in line 10 and 11 in Algorithm 2 must be respectively substituted by the following updates\displaystyle\hat{l}\displaystyle\leftarrow\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{k\neq{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}}\frac{\left|f^{\prime}_{k}\right|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{k}\|_{q}},(11)\displaystyle\bm{r}_{i}\displaystyle\leftarrow\frac{|f^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}\|_{q}^{q}}|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}|^{q-1}\odot\text{sign}(\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}),(12)where \odot is the pointwise product and q=\frac{p}{p-1}.333To see this, one can apply Holder’s inequality to obtain a lower bound on the \ell_{p} norm of the perturbation. In particular, when p=\infty (i.e., the supremum norm \ell_{\infty}), these update steps become\displaystyle\hat{l}\displaystyle\leftarrow\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{k\neq{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}}\frac{\left|f^{\prime}_{k}\right|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{k}\|_{1}},(13)\displaystyle\bm{r}_{i}\displaystyle\leftarrow\frac{|f^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}\|_{1}}\text{sign}(\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}).(14) An accurate method for finding the adversarial perturbations is thus necessary to study and compare the robustness of different classifiers to adversarial perturbations. It might be the key to a better understanding of the limits of current architectures and to design methods to increase robustness. Despite the importance of the vulnerability of state-of-the-art classifiers to adversarial instability, no well-founded method has been proposed to compute adversarial perturbations and we fill this gap in this paper. It should be noted that, when perturbations are measured using the \ell_{\infty} norm, the above conclusions remain unchanged: DeepFool yields adversarial perturbations that are smaller (hence closer to the optimum) compared to other methods for computing adversarial examples.

What is most important feature in hair fall disease model ? Is it false positive or false negative rate?,Behavior Cloning and Decision Transformer,"There is multiple important features in a model to consider: false positive and false negative rates, ignoring inter-class differences, model reliability, and overfitting problem. But the paper doesn’t mention which is the most important feature of the model. Therefore the question is not completely answerable.","Overall, we observed very few works on hair diseases. The recent related works lack at least one of the following categories – discussion over false positive and false negative rates, ignoring inter-class differences, model reliability, and overfitting problem. In this work, we have attempted to fill these gaps by leveraging a convolutional neural network Another study [19] proposed a model for early alopecia detection. They used 100 samples for this research, with 80% as training data and the other 20% as testing data. They looked for four attributes, length of the hair, nail brittleness, amount of damage made to the hair, and hair follicle. Twolayer feed-forward network with a back propagation technique was used for detection purposes. The proposed model system consisting of 4 input neurons, 10 hidden neurons, and a linear output neuron, achieved 91% training accuracy with 86.7% validation accuracy. It showed the best performance at epoch 4 with a 0.059687 gradient. However, the study has some pitfalls, too, as they did not mention their data source or differentiate data classes with their respective sample sizes. Also, no image pre-processing was performed on the collected images. Although there is a possibility of overfitting without a proper data balancing technique, this report did not discuss the data balancing between the two classes.

What are the possible reason androgenetic alopecia or MPB is less severe in women as compared to men?,"The paper's proposed multimodal feature learning algorithm is better than other methods that ""ignore modality information at the first layer"" or ""train separate first-layer features for each modality"" because it allows for a middle-ground in which each feature is encouraged to use only a subset of the input modalities, but is not forced to use only particular ones. This approach allows the model to learn correlated features between multiple input modalities, but regularizes the number of modalities used per feature, discouraging the model from learning weak correlations between modalities","MPB is an X-linked polygenic
disease, and males are more genetically prone to develop baldness at a mature age. That's why MPB is less severe in women as compared to men.","Alopecia, folliculitis, and psoriasis are some common causes of hair loss. There is a difference between regular hair fall and alopecia; the latter develops coin-sized bald patches all over the scalp area. Alopecia or patchy hair loss can be of different types. Androgenetic alopecia or male-pattern baldness (MPB) is the most common form of alopecia where the hairline starts to recede, following a pattern where the frontal and temple area are most affected. 70% of men and 40% of women get this type of hair loss and thinning issue [3]. According to Liu et al., MPB is an X-linked polygenic disease, and males are more genetically prone to develop baldness at a mature age [5]. Topical minoxidil solution thickens the hair by 50% [3]. On the other hand, Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease affecting individuals irrespective of age and sex.

Therefore, AI-based approach for fast detection is a good way to make people go for the early diagnosis of the hair diseases.","Some scalp infections may be treatable if diagnosed early. Some but not all diseases may go on their own. Only an expert physician can detect the illness by visual observation. In some cases, early disease detection is beneficial for dermatologists to initiate the treatment. An early scalp inspection includes a dermatoscopic examination of the scalp for inflammation, itching, localized lesion, dandruff, follicular flakes, louse eggs (nits), and a scalp biopsy. Besides visual observation, the patient can undergo blood and hormone tests to detect the exact disease. Unfortunately, most hair and scalp diseases are diagnosed in advanced stages, which complicate the treatment options. All these factors lengthen the diagnosis and treatment process. Therefore, researchers are putting more effort into developing different mechanisms for the early detection of hair and scalp diseases. Disease detection using machine learning approaches is gaining popularity in health informatics. Many skin and scalp-related diseases can be detected using images of infected regions within a few seconds. In one study by Choudhary et al.

Even a small change in the prompt can result in a different output image due to the complex and non-linear nature of the diffusion process,"In all the models - CNN or SVM or FNN gets very high accuracy. In all the experiment number of dataset is very limited. Since there is no experiment on smaller/higher dataset, it is difficult to answer weather the CNN really achieving that accuracy or not with this limited dataset. Therefore, this paper doesn't fully answer this question.","Another study [19] proposed a model for early alopecia detection. They used 100 samples for this research, with 80% as training data and the other 20% as testing data. They looked for four attributes, length of the hair, nail brittleness, amount of damage made to the hair, and hair follicle. Two- layer feed-forward network with a back propagation technique was used for detection purposes. The proposed model system consisting of 4 input neurons, 10 hidden neurons, and a linear output neuron, achieved 91% training accuracy with 86.7% validation accuracy. It showed the best performance at epoch 4 with a 0.059687 gradient. However, the study has some pitfalls, too, as they did not mention their data source or differentiate data classes with their respective sample sizes. Also, no image pre-processing was performed on the collected images. Although there is a possibility of overfitting without a proper data balancing technique, this report did not discuss the data balancing between the two classes. Furthermore, they did not calculate the model’s false- positive and false-negative rates, which is crucial for a model specially developed for the healthcare system. Related work [20] was performed on skin disease detection, where machine learning was used to analyze the digital image of the affected skin area for identifying eczema, melanoma, and psoriasis. Their dataset consists of 80 images from different websites specific to skin diseases. By using a convolutional neural network for feature extraction and applying multiclass SVM on those features, they achieved 100% accuracy in disease classification. However, they did not explore other essential model performance matrices and overfitting issues. In another skin disease detection-based article [21], the authors proposed a scheme to classify skin lesions into five categories: healthy, acne, eczema, benign, and malignant melanoma, using a pre-trained CNN model, AlexNET for feature extraction and error correcting output codes support vector machine for classification. The dataset consists of 9144 images from different sources and achieved 84.21% accuracy using a 10-fold cross-validation technique. algorithm on hair disease images while maintaining high accuracy with good precision and recall scores. Although early-stage detection of hair and scalp-related diseases is the key to the treatment process, hair loss and scalp diseases can often go undetected due to a lack of awareness and a lengthy diagnosis test. An AI-based application might pave the way to facilitate early disease detection. In this study, we developed a machine learning model to accurately predict three hair and scalp-related diseases: alopecia, folliculitis, and psoriasis by feeding 150 preprocessed image data into a 2-D convolutional neural network model. After using 70% of the data to train the model, we analyzed remaining 30% of images for testing our model. After subsequent training, the model gave an overall 96.2% training accuracy on the training data and 91.1% validation accuracy for the test data, with a high precision and recall scores for each disease type. We have also provided our dataset with this study. Our proposed system would assist dermatologists and patients with a better understanding of disease classification and initiating early treatment options for the three most frequently occurred hair and scalp diseases."
How does the author conclude that non-local means filter is the best filter for denoising the images ? Are there any other filters that can be used for the same task?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The pseudo-query generator is likely to generalize well to a target corpus that is significantly different from the source domain on which it was trained","The author tested images on multiple filters including gaussian filter, median filter with kernel_size = 3, bilateral filter, and non-local means filter with patch_size = 3 and patch_distance = 5. Comparing with other filter non-local means filter best result by preserving all the edges and reducing noise.","Noise is the degradation of image signals caused by external sources [23]. Noise introduces random variations of brightness or color information in the captured images. Most of the time, images on the internet have some noise associated with them. As we have collected most of the data samples from different dermatology websites, the noise in our dataset is not homogeneously distributed, which made it more complex. Therefore, we applied additional filters for denoising the collected images. We started with the gaussian filter for a better image classification process. However, after using the gaussian filter, the images become completely blurred, which leads to the loss of important information and damage to the edges. We then applied the median filter, which worked better than the gaussian filter with kernel_size = 3. Though we achieved better accuracy using the bilateral filter, we got the best results while applying the non-local means filter with patch_size = 3 and patch_distance = 5. This non-local means filter preserved all the edges and reduced the noise better than the other filters for our application which is shown in Fig. 3."

The researchers divided the dataset into 70%-30% train-test-split and applied a support vector machine (SNM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) for the classification task. Overall, they achieved 91.4% and 88.9% accuracy using SVM and KNN, respectively, with a 10-fold cross-validation approach. However, using other machine learning algorithms might increase in the accuracy rate, which should have been discussed. Besides, the application of Histogram Equalization (HE) for image enhancement complicated the process of getting accurate texture features from distorted images, as HE itself adds noise to the output image, distorting the signals. Moreover, this study only shed light on alopecia areata disease, ignoring the inter-class differences between other similar type diseases, which increased the likelihood of inaccurate prediction of other diseases as alopecia areata, thereby making this framework less reliable. Often the captured image doesn’t reflect the natural view and needs contrast enhancement to meet the level of realistic view [24]. Especially images with high color depth and after denoising effects need normalization for a better realistic view [25]. First, we applied histogram equalization (HE). However, the HE increases the contrast of the background when used in images with low color depth, and information is lost as the histogram is not confined to the local region. To overcome the problem, we applied CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) by dividing an image into equal size non-overlapping areas and computing a histogram for each region. After clipping the histogram, we distributed the clipped value over the histogram equalization, which gives us control of the over-amplification of the contrast and generates the resultant image shown in Fig. 4."
What is 'autokeras' ? How it works?,"The authors sped up the training by using an adjustable gradient clipping, residual-learning CNN, and extremely high learning rates",Autokeras is best way to find model parameter. It automatically tries different combination (in this case is 25) and find size of the model network.

After trying 25 different combinations, we selected 3 hidden layers with 1 input and 1 output layer as our final model which is shown in Fig. 5. For training the model, we used batch_size = 16 with 50 epochs for each batch. The preprocessed data is divided into 70-30 train-test-split for training and validation purpose. Our model consists of 256 inputs, 3 x 3 square kernel, 3 output units and a softmax output. We used ReLU as our activation function to prevent the exponential growth of required computation and to explore the non-linear relationship between input and output variables. After each convolutional layer, input goes through the pooling layer having 2 x 2 kernel size to reduce the dimensions of the features map. Pooling layer summarizes the presented features in a region and helps to prevent the over-fitting problem by down sampling. We also used dropout layer after each pooling layer to prevent neurons in a layer from synchronously optimizing their weights and converging to the same goal.

What were the various hyperparameter used in 'grid search'?,"To generalize disentanglement and avoid pitfalls in VAEs, such as degenerate latent representations","Hyperparameters are Batch Size 16, Epoch 50, Kernel Size 3 x 3, Optimizer Adam, Dropout Rate 0.3, Pooling Size 2 x 2, Activation Function ReLU.","We trained our CNN model using the optimal hyperparameters selected from the grid search.

Why in the case of Alopecia areata the body's immune cell can't recognise hair follicle as 'self?,"The variations in camera poses for the different robots were determined using a combination of wear and tear, object interactions, and slightly different camera poses relative to the robot base","Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease where the body’s immune cells cannot recognize hair follicles as ‘self.’ Instead, they consider these follicles as ‘foreign'. It is an example of a hereditary disease. But the paper didn't fully discussed why the cell can't recognise hair follicle as 'self'. Therefore the question cannot be answered fully.","Alopecia, folliculitis, and psoriasis are some common causes of hair loss. There is a difference between regular hair fall and alopecia; the latter develops coin-sized bald patches all over the scalp area. Alopecia or patchy hair loss can be of different types. Androgenetic alopecia or male-pattern baldness (MPB) is the most common form of alopecia where the hairline starts to recede, following a pattern where the frontal and temple area are most affected. 70% of men and 40% of women get this type of hair loss and thinning issue [3]. According to Liu et al., MPB is an X-linked polygenic disease, and males are more genetically prone to develop baldness at a mature age [5]. Topical minoxidil solution thickens the hair by 50% [3]. On the other hand, Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease affecting individuals irrespective of age and sex. Primarily affecting the scalp area, AA can also spread in the beard, eyelashes, and eyebrows. In this case, the body’s immune cells cannot recognize hair follicles as ‘self.’ Instead, they consider these follicles as ‘foreign,’ which ultimately causes the hair follicles to be targeted and destroyed by the immune cells. It is an example of a hereditary disease. The study from Benigno et al. reported that, in the US alone, 700,000 individuals suffer from AA [6]. This disease, if diagnosed early, might resolve spontaneously. In severe cases, topical corticosteroid or immune therapy is used."

What is difference between CNN and D-CNN?,"Yes.

Longer sentences will have higher absolute value of loss because the negative log likelihood of the correct word at each step is summed over more words, resulting in a greater total loss","The paper directly didn't mentioned the difference between CNN and D-CNN. But it is referable from P1 and P2 that, D-CNN multilayered, hierarchical and block-structure compare to CNN.","CNN has built a model of the human brain using the mixture of these networks. CNN layers are organized so that simpler patterns (lines, curves, etc.) are detected initially and more complicated patterns (faces, objects, etc.) are detected afterwards. However, CNN has drawn a lot of interest in data science since it has demonstrated its ability to locate, segment, and identify objects in images. In this study, the term ""original CNN architecture"" refers to a CNN network and algorithm that are available on Keras or Github. In this study, the CNN algorithm is used exactly as its creators and programmers intended it to be, with no modifications to its processing units, parameterization and hyper-parameter optimization methodologies, design patterns, or layer connections. A well-known CNN network was frequently created and improved by several researchers and programmers over the course of numerous difficulties. Deep learning is a crucial artificial intelligence tool for solving many complicated computer vision problems. Image categorization uses deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) problems. Such models work best with lots of data. Because professional clinicians must classify each image, obtaining such a large volume of labeled data for biomedical image classification tasks is expensive and time-consuming. Transfer learning circumvents this issue. This method applies network weights from a model trained on a large dataset to a small dataset problem. Biomedical image categorization often uses CNN models trained on ImageNet, which has over 14 million images. Data scientists have been drawn to the concept of utilizing Deep Convolutional Neural Network (D-CNN) in identifying, classifying, and segmenting brain tumors as a result of the visible benefits of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (D-CNN) in Medical Image Analysis. When it comes to segmenting the timorous region included inside a brain, D-CNN is a set of techniques that has the potential to produce better outcomes when compared to techniques that do not involve deep learning. The multilayered, hierarchical, and block structure of D-CNN allows for the extraction of low-, mid-, and high-level information from pictures of brain tumors. D-CNN shows an outstanding performance in solving the segmentation and classification issues that are based on time and effort consuming tasks like fractionalization of brain tumor cells in Medical Image scans. This is in contrast to the large amount of time and effort that is required for the segmentation process by doctors and radiologists due to the high quantity of data produced by scan centers."
Which ensemle learning avg. probablity or weighted avg. probablity is used by the author in modelling?,The authors claimed that their approach overcame the problems posed by ultrasound in earlier approaches by using a combination of data augmentation and a voting strategy to improve segmentation accuracy,In P1 the author mentioned they developed a novel weight allocation method. That answer the question that the author used weighted avg. probability in modelling.,"voting are some of the ensemble techniques that have been utilized in research in the literature most frequently. Each constituent base learner is given equal priority by the average probability-based ensemble. But for a specific issue, one basic classifier might be better equipped to gather data than another. Therefore, weighting all of the base classifiers is a better technique. However, the importance of the weights given to each classifier is the most important component in ensuring the ensemble's improved performance. The majority of methods base this number on the outcomes of experiments. In this study, we developed a novel weight allocation method in which the best weights for three base CNN models—SeresNet152, ResNet152v2, and DenseNet- 201, Vgg-19, and Resnext101—were determined using four evaluation metrics: precision, recall, f1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC). For providing weights to the base learners in research in the literature, only classification accuracy was often taken into account [8], which may not be a sufficient metric, especially when the datasets are class imbalanced. Other indicators might offer more useful data for deciding how important the basic learner is."

Why does author use K-mode instead of K-means?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

By comparing the performance of the networks on the test set","K-Modes clustering is more accurate than using K-means clustering as the K-mode algorithm uses categorical data to form clusters. Since the data in this paper is categorical, K-Modes is used. This question is found directly in the paper.","The personality prediction is supported in this work by a questionnaire-based investigation. Openness to criticism, flexibility, team spirit, aspirations, and work ethics are among the traits that personality interview questions reveal. This aids to figure out how well a candidate may collaborate and work with team members. The responses to these queries give insight into the qualifications for the position The K- Modes clustering method is used in this survey-based investigation. The technique, which is simple to use and effective with vast amounts of data, is used to group categorical data. Based on the number of comparable categories between data points, clusters are defined. The k- modes clustering algorithm is an advancement over the k- means clustering method. K-means is the most widely used centre-based partitional clustering technique. Huang extends the k-means clustering method to the k-modes clustering algorithm to organize the categorical data: KModes clustering is one of the unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms that is used to cluster categorical variables. It is easy to implement and efficiently handles a large amount of data. A Kmodes technique uses a randomly selected starting cluster centre (modes) as a seed, which Categorical data cannot be clustered using the K-means clustering method due to the different metrics it uses. The K- mode cluster algorithms are based on the K-mean pattern but eliminate the restriction on numerical data while maintaining their efficacy. By removing the restriction imposed by Kmeans after modification, this K-mode technique extends the K-mean pattern to cluster categorical data: The distance cannot be calculated for categorical data points, though [46]. KModes algorithm is what we choose. It makes use of the differences between the data points (total mismatches). Our data points are more comparable overall, the smaller the differences. Rather than using means, it employs modes [36]. K-Modes clustering is more accurate than using K-means clustering as the K-mode algorithm uses categorical data to form clusters."
What are 'AVI-AI' administrative systems?,Yes,AVI-AI is a AI based asynchronous video interviewing technology that helps to automate administrative tasks.,"This article makes suggestions for using the Ocean model based on AVI (referred to as AVI-AI) or the Big Five personality traits to forecast a person's personality [3]. AVI- AI methods have drawn a lot of interest in the disciplines of computer sciences and human resources, particularly for autonomously evaluating personality traits [4] and communication skills [5]. Unknown are the reliability and accuracy of the ground-breaking employment selection tool known as AVI-AI. Automatically conducting interviews at a specific time is possible with the help of asynchronous video interviewing technology (AVI). The interview can be reviewed by employers at a later time. If employers want to examine how the candidates replied to the questions, they may also allow anyone to watch the recorded interview. It is difficult for human reviewers to accurately. The AVI is a clever administrative system, but there is no evidence to date that it is intelligent or has analytical capabilities. But analysis of this data is necessary [29]. AI- based AI needs to be trained properly. In a study by Hickman et al. in 2021, an AI was instructed to analyse a list of items to automatically assess a person's personality [37]. Automated interviewing reduces the administrative burden on hiring teams, enhancing flexibility, efficiency, and automation of administrative tasks.

Automated interviewing reduces the administrative burden on hiring teams, enhancing flexibility, efficiency, and automation of administrative tasks. By removing pointless processes, they assist businesses in finding top personnel more quickly. The following are some advantages of automated interviews:"
What are the various component of individual work performance?,"There is no one-size-fits-all definition for text-video paired datasets, as the length and content of both the text descriptions and the videos can vary greatly depending on the specific application and use case. However, some common practices for creating text-video paired datasets include:

* Video length: Videos can range from a few seconds to several minutes in length, depending on the complexity of the scene and the desired level of detail.
* Text length: Text descriptions can range from a few words to several sentences or even paragraphs, depending on the complexity of the scene and the desired level of detail.
* Text-video alignment: To ensure that the text and video are properly aligned, some datasets may use a temporal alignment method, such as frame-level alignment or sentence-level alignment.

Overall, the key is to ensure that the text and video are closely aligned in terms of both time and content, so that the model can learn to generate videos that accurately reflect the given text description","Task performance, contextual performance and counter productive to work behaviour are the three components of individual work performance.","To assess how well current employees are working, individual work performance (IWP), a useful and regularly used outcome measure, is often utilized. Job performance may be correlated with personality. The phrase ""behaviours or acts that are related to the aims of the organization"" [7] is a definition of IWP. IWP thus emphasizes employee behaviours or activities rather than the outcomes of those behaviours. Additionally, behaviours should be in the individual's control, omitting those that are limited by the environment [8]. The personalities of the employees at any given time can be ascertained from their answers to a series of questions that can be given to them. The first dimension, task performance, traditionally has received the most attention and can be defined as ""the proficiency with which individuals perform the core substantive or technical tasks central to his or her job"" [7]. The second dimension of IWP is contextual performance, defined as “behaviours that support the organizational, social and psychological environment in which the technical core must function” [9]. The third dimension of IWP is counterproductive to work behaviour, defined as “behaviour that harms the well-being of the organization” [8]."

"Can image content and style be ""fully"" or ""completely"" separated?","No. While both channel shuffle and random sparse convolution involve rearranging the channel dimensions of a convolutional layer, they serve different purposes and have different effects on the network's performance. Random sparse convolution is designed to reduce the computational cost of convolutional layers by randomly dropping out channels, whereas channel shuffle is used to enable cross-group information flow and improve the performance of multiple group convolutional layers","The paper suggests that it is impossible to completely separate the content and the style of the image. But it is possible to extract their representations to then combine them with a loss function that allows the generation of visually appealing images that somewhat satisfy (not fully) the content and stylistic constraints. It is important to mention that the artistic style representation is just a correlation of filter responses between layers in CNN. The paper suggests that this is a plausible way to obtain the content-independent visual appearance of the image. When the object recognition model is learning, it has to be able to extract features that are invariant to different variations of images. Thus, it allows the separation of content and style representations. Previous methods use non-parametric techniques that directly manipulate the pixels of the image without such separation of representations.","Again, we can visualise the information captured by these style feature spaces built on different layers of the network by constructing an image that matches the style representation of a given input image (Fig 1, style reconstructions). 10,11 Indeed reconstructions from the style features produce texturised versions of the input image that capture its general appearance in terms of colour and localised structures. Moreover, the size and complexity of local image structures from the input image increases along the hierarchy, a result that can be explained by the increasing receptive ﬁeld sizes and feature complexity. We refer to this multi-scale representation as style representation . The key ﬁnding of this paper is that the representations of content and style in the Convo- lutional Neural Network are separable. That is, we can manipulate both representations inde- pendently to produce new, perceptually meaningful images. To demonstrate this ﬁnding, we generate images that mix the content and style representation from two different source images. In particular, we match the content representation of a photograph depicting the “Neckarfront” in T ¨ ubingen, Germany and the style representations of several well-known artworks taken from different periods of art (Fig 2). The images are synthesised by ﬁnding an image that simultaneously matches the content representation of the photograph and the style representation of the respective piece of art (see Methods for details). While the global arrangement of the original photograph is preserved, the colours and local structures that compose the global scenery are provided by the artwork. Effectively, this renders the photograph in the style of the artwork, such that the appearance of the synthesised image resembles the work of art, even though it shows the same content as the photograph. As outlined above, the style representation is a multi-scale representation that includes mul- tiple layers of the neural network. In the images we have shown in Fig 2, the style representation including only a smaller number of lower layers, leading to different visual experiences (Fig 3, along the rows). When matching the style representations up to higher layers in the network, local images structures are matched on an increasingly large scale, leading to a smoother and more continuous visual experience. Thus, the visually most appealing images are usually cre- ated by matching the style representation up to the highest layers in the network (Fig 3, last row). Of course, image content and style cannot be completely disentangled. When synthesising an image that combines the content of one image with the style of another, there usually does not exist an image that perfectly matches both constraints at the same time. However, the loss function we minimise during image synthesis contains two terms for content and style respectively, that are well separated (see Methods). We can therefore smoothly regulate the emphasis on either reconstructing the content or the style (Fig 3, along the columns). A strong emphasis on style will result in images that match the appearance of the artwork, effectively giving a texturised version of it, but hardly show any of the photograph’s content (Fig 3, ﬁrst column). When placing strong emphasis on content, one can clearly identify the photograph, but the style of the painting is not as well-matched (Fig 3, last column). For a speciﬁc pair of source images one can adjust the trade-off between content and style to create visually appealing images. Here we present an artiﬁcial neural system that achieves a separation of image content from style, thus allowing to recast the content of one image in the style of any other image. We demonstrate this by creating new, artistic images that combine the style of several well-known paintings with the content of an arbitrarily chosen photograph. In particular, we derive the neural representations for the content and style of an image from the feature responses of high- performing Deep Neural Networks trained on object recognition. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst demonstration of image features separating content from style in whole natural images. Previous work on separating content from style was evaluated on sensory inputs of much lesser complexity, such as characters in different handwriting or images of faces or small ﬁgures in different poses. 12,13 In our demonstration, we render a given photograph in the style of a range of well-known artworks. This problem is usually approached in a branch of computer vision called non- photorealistic rendering (for recent review see 14 ). Conceptually most closely related are meth- ods using texture transfer to achieve artistic style transfer. 15–19 However, these previous ap- proaches mainly rely on non-parametric techniques to directly manipulate the pixel representa- tion of an image. In contrast, by using Deep Neural Networks trained on object recognition, we carry out manipulations in feature spaces that explicitly represent the high level content of an image. Features from Deep Neural Networks trained on object recognition have been previously used for style recognition in order to classify artworks according to the period in which they were created. 20 There, classiﬁers are trained on top of the raw network activations, which we call content representations. We conjecture that a transformation into a stationary feature space such as our style representation might achieve even better performance in style classiﬁcation. In general, our method of synthesising images that mix content and style from different sources, provides a new, fascinating tool to study the perception and neural representation of art, style and content-independent image appearance in general. We can design novel stimuli that introduce two independent, perceptually meaningful sources of variation: the appearance and the content of an image. We envision that this will be useful for a wide range of experimen- tal studies concerning visual perception ranging from psychophysics over functional imaging to even electrophysiological neural recordings. In fact, our work offers an algorithmic under- standing of how neural representations can independently capture the content of an image and the style in which it is presented. Importantly, the mathematical form of our style representa- 8 tions generates a clear, testable hypothesis about the representation of image appearance down to the single neuron level. The style representations simply compute the correlations between different types of neurons in the network. Extracting correlations between neurons is a bio- logically plausible computation that is, for example, implemented by so-called complex cells in the primary visual system (V1). 21 Our results suggest that performing a complex-cell like computation at different processing stages along the ventral stream would be a possible way to obtain a content-independent representation of the appearance of a visual input. All in all it is truly fascinating that a neural system, which is trained to perform one of the core computational tasks of biological vision, automatically learns image representations that allow the separation of image content from style. The explanation could be that when learning object recognition, the network has to become invariant to all image variation that preserves object identity. Representations that factorise the variation in the content of an image and the variation in its appearance would be extremely practical for this task. Thus, our ability to abstract content from style and therefore our ability to create and enjoy art might be primarily a preeminent signature of the powerful inference capabilities of our visual system."
Which loss function is used by authors during image synthesis? ,Machine Translation (MT) domains,"The loss function consists of 2 separate terms for content representation and artistic style representation. The difference between the content representation of the original image and the reconstructed image is calculated by taking the squared-error loss of the two. While the difference between the stylistic representation of the original artwork and the reconstructed image is calculated by taking the mean-square distance for each layer and combining them by averaging the weighted sum. In the paper, the weights for each style representation of a layer are distributed equally.","creases with the position of the layer in the network.

So the responses in a layer l can be stored in a matrix F l ∈ R N l × M l where F lij is the activation of the i th ﬁlter at position j in layer l . To visualise the image information that is encoded at different layers of the hierarchy (Fig 1, content reconstructions) we perform gradient descent on a white noise image to ﬁnd another image that matches the feature responses of the original image.

Would the reconstruction from higher layers be as good as reconstruction from the lower layers? Why or why not?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Training VTHarm cannot guarantee a disentangled representation of the desired aspect because it relies solely on the reconstruction loss to learn the representation, which may not be sufficient to capture the desired aspect of the data","The content representation of the photograph resembles the pixel-wise image more in the lower layers, but encodes the more high-level contents in the higher layers. To construct the results in Figure 2, the authors use the content representation from one of the highest layers 'conv_4_2', which means they fuse well with the extracted style representations. Also, it is possible to change the emphasis between the content representation and style representation using the loss function. In general, the results of combining lower-layer content representations with styles are not presented, thus it is difficult to answer the question just from the paper's contents.","The class of Deep Neural Networks that are most powerful in image processing tasks are called Convolutional Neural Networks. Convolutional Neural Networks consist of layers of small computational units that process visual information hierarchically in a feed-forward man- ner (Fig 1). Each layer of units can be understood as a collection of image ﬁlters, each of which extracts a certain feature from the input image. Thus, the output of a given layer consists of so-called feature maps: differently ﬁltered versions of the input image. When Convolutional Neural Networks are trained on object recognition, they develop a representation of the image that makes object information increasingly explicit along the pro- cessing hierarchy. 8 Therefore, along the processing hierarchy of the network, the input image is transformed into representations that increasingly care about the actual content of the im- age compared to its detailed pixel values. We can directly visualise the information each layer contains about the input image by reconstructing the image only from the feature maps in that layer 9 (Fig 1, content reconstructions, see Methods for details on how to reconstruct the im- age). Higher layers in the network capture the high-level content in terms of objects and their arrangement in the input image but do not constrain the exact pixel values of the reconstruc- tion. (Fig 1, content reconstructions d,e). In contrast, reconstructions from the lower layers simply reproduce the exact pixel values of the original image (Fig 1, content reconstructions a,b,c). We therefore refer to the feature responses in higher layers of the network as the content representation . To obtain a representation of the style of an input image, we use a feature space originally designed to capture texture information. 8 This feature space is built on top of the ﬁlter responses in each layer of the network. It consists of the correlations between the different ﬁlter responses the images shown in Fig 2 we matched the content representation on layer ‘conv4 2’ and the style representations on layers ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’, ‘conv4 1’ and ‘conv5 1’ ( w l = 1 / 5 in those layers, w l = 0 in all other layers) . The ratio α/β was either 1 × 10 − 3 (Fig 2 B,C,D) or 1 × 10 − 4 (Fig 2 E,F). Fig 3 shows results for different relative weightings of the content and style reconstruction loss (along the columns) and for matching the style representations only on layer ‘conv1 1’ (A), ‘conv1 1’ and ‘conv2 1’ (B), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’ and ‘conv3 1’ (C), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’ and ‘conv4 1’ (D), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’, ‘conv4 1’ and ‘conv5 1’ (E). The factor w l was always equal to one divided by the number of active layers with a non-zero loss-weight w l . including only a smaller number of lower layers, leading to different visual experiences (Fig 3, along the rows). When matching the style representations up to higher layers in the network, local images structures are matched on an increasingly large scale, leading to a smoother and more continuous visual experience.

This is done by minimising the mean-squared distance between the entries of the Gram matrix from the original image and the Gram matrix of the image to be generated. So let ~a and ~x be the original image and the image that is generated and Al and Gl their respective style representations in layer l. The contribution of that layer to the total loss is then El = 1 4N 2 l M 2 l ∑ i,j (Gl ij − Al ij )2 (4) and the total loss is Lstyle(~a, ~x) = L∑ l=0 wlEl (5) where wl are weighting factors of the contribution of each layer to the total loss (see below for specific values of wl in our results). The derivative of El with respect to the activations in layer l can be computed analytically: ∂El ∂F l ij = { 1 N 2 l M 2 l ((F l)T (Gl − Al)) ji if F l ij > 0 0 if F l ij < 0 . (6) The gradients of El with respect to the activations in lower layers of the network can be readily computed using standard error back-propagation. The five style reconstructions in Fig 1 were generated by matching the style representations on layer ‘conv1 1’ (a), ‘conv1 1’ and ‘conv2 1’ (b), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’ and ‘conv3 1’ (c), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’ and ‘conv4 1’ (d), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’, ‘conv4 1’ and ‘conv5 1’ (e). To generate the images that mix the content of a photograph with the style of a painting (Fig 2) we jointly minimise the distance of a white noise image from the content representation of the photograph in one layer of the network and the style representation of the painting in a number of layers of the CNN. So let ~p be the photograph and ~a be the artwork. The loss function we minimise is Ltotal(~p, ~a, ~x) = αLcontent(~p, ~x) + βLstyle(~a, ~x) (7) where α and β are the weighting factors for content and style reconstruction respectively. For the images shown in Fig 2 we matched the content representation on layer ‘conv4 2’ and the style representations on layers ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’, ‘conv4 1’ and ‘conv5 1’ (wl = 1/5 in those layers, wl = 0 in all other layers) . The ratio α/β was either 1×10−3 (Fig 2 B,C,D) or 1 × 10−4 (Fig 2 E,F). Fig 3 shows results for different relative weightings of the content and style reconstruction loss (along the columns) and for matching the style representations only on layer ‘conv1 1’ (A), ‘conv1 1’ and ‘conv2 1’ (B), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’ and ‘conv3 1’ (C), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’ and ‘conv4 1’ (D), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’, ‘conv4 1’ and ‘conv5 1’ (E). The factor wl was always equal to one divided by the number of active layers with a non-zero loss-weight wl."
What makes SBM-Transformer novel compared to existing efficient Transformer variants?,"NO. While the system performs well when the intermediate predictions are close to the physical ground truth, it can still synthesize views with reasonable quality even when the predictions are imperfect",SBM-Transformer is the first Transformer architecture that can data-adaptively choose between linear to full attention with respective computational costs.,"To contribute to the efficient Transformers lineage, we propose SBM-Transformer, capable of adjusting its attention sparsity data-adaptively based without fully computing the attention score matrix (Figure 1). Leveraging a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM) [2], each attention head samples a bipartite graph connecting queries to keys. Then, the adjacency of the sampled graph is used as an attention mask so that only attention scores corresponding to sampled edges are computed.The overall computational cost is linear in the number of edges, which can range from linear to quadratic in sequence length depending on the data and task under concern. Each attention head is equipped with its own underlying SBM, enabling the model to diversify the attention sparsity across heads and layers. By incorporating a straight-through estimator [4] in the discrete graph-sampling step, SBM-Transformer enjoys end-to-end differentiability and can find the proper attention sparsity based solely upon minimizing the predictive loss. The model can also easily be further regularized by penalizing the number of sampled edges, which results in a lighter model using less computational resources during inference. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first Transformer architecture that can data-adaptively choose between linear to full attention with respective computational costs. To summarize, our main contributions are as follows:"
What is a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model?,"No, we can extend it to more frames.

The current implementation only trains on a fixed number of frames (16) at a time, but we can extend the video by applying the model autoregressively using a new method for conditional generation. This allows us to generate longer videos by extending our sampled videos to arbitrary lengths",The mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is a generative model that encodes the latent structure of graphs by assigning each node into multiple clusters.,"The Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is a generative model that encodes the latent structure of graphs by grouping nodes into clusters. By modeling the cluster-membership of each node as well as inter-cluster relationships, SBMs can represent a wide variety of graph structures, which is a feature especially useful for generating new graphs or predicting missing edges in noisy data [1]. The standard SBM assigns each node to a single cluster, and the probability of an edge between two nodes strictly depends on the corresponding clusters. Several structural extensions include overlapping SBM [24] and mixed-membership SBM [2], which allow each node to be assigned to multiple clusters. The underlying SBM used by our framework mostly resembles these two variants, while the edge probability is modeled by a nonlinear function of two node embeddings rather than a bilinear one. There exist many other extensions including degree-corrected SBM [20] for multi-graphs and hierarchical SBM [31] for multiplex-graphs. Further details can be found in a recent survey [16]."
In what way can SBM-Transformer be considered better than Reformer?,To provide a fair and widely accepted basis for comparing the performance of Mask R-CNN with other state-of-the-art models on the COCO dataset,"SBM-Transformer allows more flexible attention mask structures between linear to full attention with respective computational costs, while Reformer can only use block-diagonal masks that cannot model hierarchical contexts.","Table 8 shows the test accuracies of each method. Our SBM-Transformer achieves the best overall performance, ranking first in two tasks, and second in one other. SBM-Transformer also outperforms full attention in all five tasks while computing 30% or less attention scores on average, which supports our claim that masked attention with partial attention score computations can be preferred over full attention depending on the task. With respect to the attention mask structure, we find that flexibility of SBM is indeed beneficial, as Reformer struggles in ListOps, most likely due to the inability of block-diagonal masks to model hierarchical contexts. To contribute to the efficient Transformers lineage, we propose SBM-Transformer, capable of adjusting its attention sparsity data-adaptively based without fully computing the attention score matrix (Figure 1). Leveraging a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM) [2], each"
"What is a ""Hamiltonian path""?","BLEU-1 and BLEU-4 differ in the level of precision they consider. BLEU-1 only considers unigrams (individual words), while BLEU-4 considers precision at the 4-gram level, which includes phrases of four words",A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits all nodes in a graph.,"Then, we can show that these three patterns form directed graphs that together satisfy the three"
"What is ""local attention""?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The author chooses the optimal number of clusters using the modified Elbow method, which focuses on within-cluster differences and selects the value of k at the point where the increase in the value does not significantly decrease with the addition of k",Local attention is a Transformer model that uses a sliding window of some fixed context window size.,"One way to remove the quadratic bottleneck from the attention score matrix is to apply a binary mask \bm{M}\in\{0,1\}^{n\times n} and compute the scaled dot-products \bm{Q}_{i}\bm{K}_{j}^{T}/\sqrt{d_{h}} only if \bm{M}_{ij}=1. In presence of an attention mask, the operation is modified to\displaystyle\texttt{Attn}_{\text{mask}}(\bm{X},\bm{M})=\sigma_{\bm{M}}\left(\bm{M}\odot\dfrac{\bm{Q}\bm{K}^{T}}{\sqrt{d_{h}}}\right)\bm{V}(3)\displaystyle\sigma_{\bm{M}}(\bm{A})_{ij}\coloneqq\begin{cases}\dfrac{\exp(\bm{A}_{ij})}{\sum_{k\in\{k^{\prime}|\bm{M}_{ik^{\prime}}=1\}}\exp(\bm{A}_{ik})}&\text{if}\;\;\bm{M}_{ij}=1\\\hfil 0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}(4)where \odot indicates entry-wise multiplication. Note that the masked-softmax \sigma_{\bm{M}}(\cdot) operator only computes unmasked terms, ensuring that each (i,j)-th attention score survives as nonzero if and only if \bm{M}_{ij}=1. This is thus equivalent to filling in the (i,j)-th attention score with -\infty if \bm{M}_{ij}=0, then applying the standard softmax operator. Most sparsity-based efficient Transformers fall under this formulation, while using different methods to either manually fix or learn the mask \bm{M}. For instance, local attention [9, 3, 51] with a sliding window sets \bm{M}_{ij}=1 if |i-j|<c for some context window size c while Reformer [22] sets \bm{M}_{ij}=1 if \bm{Q}_{i} and \bm{K}_{j} are hashed into the same bucket."
"How is the ""average attention sparsity"" measured in the experiments?","Maximizing log-likelihood leads to optimizing cross-entropy between the target probability distribution and the model prediction because the log-likelihood is a measure of how well the model's predictions match the target distribution. The cross-entropy loss function is a common measure of the difference between two probability distributions, and maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the cross-entropy loss. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss, the model is able to learn a probability distribution that is close to the target distribution, which in turn allows it to make more accurate predictions",The average attention sparsity is measured by the densities of masks sampled in SBM-Transformer averaged across all attention heads.,"To test if the model can effectively learn under a constraint on the computational cost, we also test the model under a sparsity-based regularizer that discourages excessive use of query-key edges. We penalize each sampled edge by adding to the predictive loss a weighted regularization term \lambda\mathcal{L}_{s}, where \mathcal{L}_{s} denotes the average mask density across all attention heads. Table 9 shows the performance of SBM-Transformer across varying regularization weights. Under strong regularization, the model surprisingly retains competitive performance while significantly reducing the average mask density.This indicates that similar local optima are shared across regimes with varying attention density in the loss landscape, and the regularization term is able to drive the model towards finding optimal attention scores with smaller density. We also compare the densities of masks sampled at each layer of SBM-Transformer during test time to examine whether our model is capable of diversifying sparsity across layers for better performance. Recall that this allows models to gather information in different levels, as seen in pretrained BERT where lower layers focus on the overall content via dense attention while upper layers gather syntactic information with tree-like patterns [11]. For each of the five tasks, we pick two highest-performing models (one for unregularized and another for regularized) for measurement. Figure 5 shows the average layer-wise mask densities of unregularized and regularized SBM-Transformers across different tasks. We find that under no regularization, the two layers can differ by more than 10% in tasks such as ListOps and Image. This may be due to the hierarchical and compositional structure of the two tasks. We also find that the variation is relatively low in Text with densities around 25%, indicating that the task requires broad attention overall. Lastly, the standard deviation is extremely large in upper layers for Pathfinder, showing that it samples a wide variety of masks depending on the input."
Why was the random edge exploration technique used during training of SBM-Transformer?,"Dense 1X1 convolutions are computationally expensive because they require a large number of multiplication-adds operations, which can be a limiting factor in extremely small networks with limited computational resources",The random edge exploration technique allows SBM-Transformer to avoid the problem of having edge probabilities accidentally collapsing to zero and to explore new edges and resuscitate their sampling probabilities if necessary.,While this approach enables backpropagation in the same O(m) cost
Transformers are typically used with multiple attention layers and heads. Why did the authors use a single-layer single-head Transformer architecture for the synthetic task of finding repeated tokens?,Yes,Using a single-layer and single-head architecture forces a constrained setting where the sole head must perform full attention to compare each token to all the others in order to attain 100% accuracy.,"For this task, we compare SBM-Transformer with k=128 clusters against various efficient Transformers: Linear Transformer [21], Linformer [45], Reformer [22], Performer [10], and Nyströmformer [48]. Across all methods, we use a single-layer and single-head architecture with 32 hidden dimensions. Note that due to this constrained setting, the sole head must perform full attention to compare each token to all the others in order to attain 100% accuracy. All models are trained for 2000 epochs where a new batch of sequences is sampled on-the-fly at each epoch. We use a batch size of 256 and learning rate of 1e-3."
The forward step of SBM-Transformer requires additional parameters and computation compared to the original Transformer architecture due to SBM sampling. Is this additional cost outweighed by exploiting sparsity?,"The authors accommodate video datasets by using a 3D U-Net diffusion model architecture, which is factorized over space and time, and by training the model jointly on video and image generative modeling objectives","SBM-Transformer is efficient compared to existing baselines in terms of FLOP count and peak memory use, but can result in longer runtimes due to sparse tensor operations being less optimized on GPU kernels.","Furthermore, we compare computational costs during inference by measuring FLOP count and peak memory usage. For SBM-Transformer, we test the model trained under \lambda=10^{-1}. Due to lack of support for sparse tensor operations in existing FLOP-counters, we measure FLOP counts by manually enumerating through each tensor operation. Table 3 shows that SBM-Transformer is comparably efficient across all tasks except for Text, where SBM-Transformer showed the largest average mask density. Note that while the cost of other baselines are fixed after initialization, the cost of SBM-Transformer is data-adaptive and can vary input-by-input. Further analysis and qualitative examples demonstrating the input-dependent attention mask densities can be found in Appendix C. Nonetheless, there are limitations due to sparse tensor operations being less optimized on GPU kernels. In the LRA experiments, we found that SBM-Transformer can result in longer runtimes compared to dense counterparts while its memory usage is much lower. While previous sparsity-based attention mechanisms with block-sparse attention are much more amenable for GPU computation [51, 9, 3], our work requires an architecture with better workload balancing and acceleration under unstructured sparsity, for which there is ongoing work [46, 54]."
Why is each attention head equipped with a 2-layer MLP in particular?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

One possible approach to handle more varied and extreme transformations in the unsupervised setting is to explore different generator architectures that are better suited for handling geometric changes, such as using generative adversarial networks (GANs) or other types of diffusion models that can capture more complex transformations","The node embeddings are obtained by processing each query and key through the 2-layer MLP, mapping token representations into the node representation space. The reason why the 2-layer MLP was chosen in particular cannot be answered in this paper.","For proper parameterization of the SBM, we must infer the nonnegative node-memberships and block matrix from the queries and keys. To do so, we equip each attention head a 2-layer MLPdh→dh with ReLU activation, and a set of k trainable cluster-embeddings C ∈ R k×dh . First, our model computes the block matrix Sˆ ∈ R k×k + by taking dot products amongst cluster-embeddings C followed by a 2-dimensional softmax activation. The node embeddings are obtained by processing each query and key through the MLPdh→dh"
The proof of Theorem 1 is a direct application of previous results on sparse Transformers. What is the exact significance of this theoretical result?,"The CNN architectures explored in this paper are CifarNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet","We show that the low-rank structure of the underlying SBMs does not degrade the expressive power of Transformer, and that SBM-Transformer can universally approximate arbitrary functions with \mathcal{O}(n) connections.","Leveraging previous work on the theoretical expressiveness of sparse attention [50, 51], we show that SBM-Transformer with a small modification111Here we consider a variant of SBM-Transformer where self-loops are added manually (i.e. \bm{M}_{ii}=1 for all i). While this is useful in theoretical analysis, we find that not having self-loops slightly helps in empirical performance and hence omit self-loops for the main experiments. retains the same level of expressibility as full attention. Specifically, we show that the low-rank structure of the underlying SBMs does not degrade the expressive power of Transformer, and that SBM-Transformer can universally approximate arbitrary functions with \mathcal{O}(n) connections. For brevity, we provide a rough overview of the proof and defer further details to Appendix A."
"Considering that GMPool requires matrix decomposition, how good is the efficiency aspect of the algorithm? Can the algorithm be used for large graphs?","The authors use a prior-preserving loss function, which is a combination of two terms: the reconstruction loss and a class-specific prior-preserving term. The loss function is given by:

L = L_r + L_p

where L_r is the reconstruction loss and L_p is the prior-preserving loss. The prior-preserving loss is a class-specific term that encourages the model to preserve the prior distribution of the class, and is given by:

L_p = λ ||hat(x) - x||^2_2

where λ is a hyperparameter, hat(x) is the generated image, and x is the target image. The goal of the prior-preserving loss is to prevent the model from overfitting to the small set of subject images and to preserve the diversity of the class",GMPool may not be eligible to be used for large graphs as is due to the large cubic time complexity.,"After acquiring the pooling operator, the pooling process becomes obvious. Nodes are in fundamental representation while edge features and adjacency matrix are in adjoint representation. Which leads to the following transformation rules.\displaystyle X_{i}^{(l+1)}=S^{(l)}X_{i}^{(l)}(13)\displaystyle E_{ij}^{(l+1)}=S^{(l)}E_{ij}^{(l)}S^{(l)T}(14)\displaystyle A_{ij}^{(l+1)}=S^{(l)}A_{ij}^{(l)}S^{(l)T}(15)If grouping is properly done, 0 (or close to 0) components will appear in the decomposed eigen value matrix. These zero eigenvalues arise naturally and play a role in disregarding group information; those are ineffective towards prediction. However, zero elements in the eigen values causes a major problem in the decomposition process since the matrix might carry a singular determinant.Eigen decomposition is based on an iterative approximation algorithm which includes unbounded terms if any two eigen values are small or close. One can see clearly about this matter in DBLP:journals/corr/IonescuVS15 .\Big{(}\frac{\partial{l}}{\partial{A}}\Big{)}=U\big{(}K^{T}\odot(U^{T}\frac{\partial{l}}{\partial{U}})+(\frac{\partial{l}}{\partial{\Lambda}})_{\textrm{diag}})(U^{T})(16)Here, \odot denotes element-wise product. Off-diagonal components of K=1/(\lambda_{i}-\lambda_{j}) causes the problem, since the value blows up to the infinity if any two eigen values are close or very small. However, there are some solutions for this matter by approximating gradient in different ways DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1906-09023 ; 9400752 ; DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2105-02498 . Those methods are developed further to achieve higher speed in the calculation DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2201-08663 . They claim that the method is noticeably faster, over 8 times, than the standard SVD which has the time complexity \mathcal{O}(n^{3}). Thus, we utilized this method in our work to stabilize and accelerate the learning process. However, since the algorithm achieves the higher speed by approximating gradients, the error compared to standard SVD grows bigger as the size of the matrix grows. Therefore, this method might not be valid with large sized graph data."
How does NGMPool work exactly? How is it different from GMPool?,"The training was unstable without the activations scaled before addition because the high number of filters in the network caused vanishing gradients, and scaling the residuals helped to stabilize the training by amplifying the gradients","NGMPool is a single-pooling variant of GMPool that does not perform SVD on the grouping matrix, but rather uses the grouping matrix as is.","To overcome this challenge, we propose GMPool, a general pooling framework that does not require an universal number of clusters as a user hyperparameter.

For each graph, GMPool parameterizes the clustering similarities in its grouping matrix via a classification layer. Finally, we perform SVD on the grouping matrix to obtain the pooling matrix such that the overall rank represents the suitable number of clusters.

What makes GMPool and NGMPool novel compared to existing graph pooling methods?,Content-controlled and structure-controlled,GMPool and NGMPool overcome the limitation of existing pooling frameworks that require a universal number of clusters as user parameter by first building a grouping matrix and decomposing the matrix into its square-root form.,"In this section, we propose a novel differentiable pooling layer, GMPool, which obtains the pooling matrix by first building a grouping matrix that contains clustering similarities of pairwise nodes and then decomposing the matrix into its square-root form. We start the section with preliminary information, then outline the details of GMPool in later sections.

How do the authors deal with the numerical instability that may occur due to incorporating SVD into the proposed method?,The metrics used to compare the efficiency of different methods for computing adversarial perturbations are the running time required for each method to compute one adversarial sample,GMPool decomposes the grouping matrix using a method that approximates gradients in SVD to stabilize gradient computations.,"After acquiring the pooling operator, the pooling process becomes obvious.

However, zero elements in the eigen values causes a major problem in the decomposition process since the matrix might carry a singular determinant.Eigen decomposition is based on an iterative approximation algorithm which includes unbounded terms if any two eigen values are small or close.

Therefore, this method might not be valid with large sized graph data. While our model is useful and effective, there is still room for improvement. First of all, despite leveraging a method to decompose the grouping matrix with stable gradient computations, there exist corner cases with a small eigengap at which the model fails to converge. This event seldom happens (about 0.00018\% in our experiments), but can be non-negligible when one needs to learn with a large number of data points. Hence, one future direction would be to impose proper constraints on the loss to avoid such gradient blowup in the grouping matrix."

Knowledge injector module, which aggregates word and entity representations from PLM and GMN, respectively, to inject implicit knowledge from text corpus into the passage embedding","While the authors chose DMPNN due to its superior performance over GNN architectures, the proposed pooling layer is module-agnostic and can be combined with any GNN. Results leveraging more recent GNN architectures such as GIN or Graph Transformers cannot be found in this paper.","As our backbone GNN, we adopt the Directed Message Passing Neural Network (DMPNN) doi:10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00237  which aggregates messages through directed edges. Note that while we chose DMPNN due to its superior performance over GNN architectures, our pooling layer is module-agnostic and can be combined with any GNN as long as node representations are returned as output.Given a graph, DMPNN first initializes the hidden state of each edge (i,j) based on its feature E_{ij} and the source-node’s feature X_{i}. At each timestep t, each directional edge gathers hidden states from incident edges into a message m_{ij}^{t+1} and updates its own hidden state to h_{ij}^{t+1} as follows\displaystyle m_{ij}^{t+1}=\sum_{k\in\mathcal{N}(i)\setminus j}h_{ki}^{t}(1)\displaystyle h_{ij}^{t+1}=\texttt{ReLU}(h_{ij}^{0}+W_{e}m_{ij}^{t+1})(2)Here, \mathcal{N}(i) denotes the set of neighboring nodes of node i and W_{e} a learnable weight. The hidden states of nodes are updated by aggregating the hidden states of incident edges into message m_{i}^{t+1}, and passing its concatenation with the node feature X_{i} into a linear layer followed by ReLU non-linearity\displaystyle m_{i}^{t+1}=\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)}h_{ij}^{t}(3)\displaystyle h_{i}^{t+1}=\texttt{ReLU}(W_{n}\texttt{concat}(X_{i},m_{i}^{t+1}))(4)Similarly, W_{n} denotes a learnable weight. Assuming DMPNN runs for T timesteps, we use (X_{out},E_{out})=\texttt{GNN}(A,X,E) to denote the output representation matrices containing hidden states of all nodes and edges, respectively (i.e., X_{out,i}=h_{i}^{T} and E_{out,ij}=h_{ij}^{T})."
Why is deduplication chosen as one of the baselines?,"The β-VAE objective contributes to disentangling through direct control of the level of overlap between encodings of the data, maximizing the entropy of the encoding distribution",Deduplicating the pretraining corpora proves to mitigate privacy risks for LMs.,"In this work, we compare our proposed method with a data preprocessing approach proposed by Kandpal et al. (2022) which shows that deduplicating the training corpora before pretraining helps pretrain LMs that show stronger robustness against extraction attacks than an LM pretrained under the same circumstances without deduplicating the pretraining corpora. However, we highlight that this approach, which may still be effective at mitigating the overall privacy risks, is not the most suitable approach when considering a realistic scenario of individuals requesting the removal of their information from the implicit parameters of the LMs."
Only a small number of examples (32) are randomly selected to be unlearned. Have the authors tried unlearning much larger portions of the training data and observing the effect on the resulting model?,By normalizing the attention coefficients using a softmax function,Results show that forgetting 128 samples at once results in a severe degradation of general LM performance while forgetting 32 samples does not.,"We show the effect of varying s (the # of data instances to be forgotten at once) in Figure 2a across model scales. We denote this approach as batch unlearning. As shown by the s=128 results, it is harder to forget more samples at once, resulting in substantial degradation of average LM performance regardless of how large the LM is. Since s\leq 32 does not show much degradation, we explore if sequentially unlearning can be a solution. In Figure 2b, we show the result of dividing the 128 samples into 4 chunks of 32 and performing sequential unlearning; we unlearn each chunk at a time until the chunk reaches the forgetting threshold. Surprisingly, as shown by the performance gap at s=128 between the dotted lines (the s=128 performance of Figure 2a) and straight lines, the end result is vastly different even though exactly the same instances were forgotten. Sequential unlearning shows almost no degradation of average LM performance. In Appendix G, we show that chunks once forgotten stay forgotten and that later chunks are forgotten much faster compared to the initial chunk. This result hints at the generalization of unlearning, which we do not further explore in the scope of this work. The result also suggests that knowledge unlearning can be continually applied to LMs when needed."
How much does the success of the EL metric vary depending on which n tokens are used as a prompt for this metric?,"YOLO struggles in localizing objects correctly due to its strong spatial constraints, which limit the number of nearby objects that can be predicted, and its reliance on coarse features for bounding box predictions",The average LM perfomance of varying n for the EL metric is shown in Table 13.,"First, we show the Extraction Likelihood (EL) Forgetting Threshold values for n=[5,10,20,40] by measuring the value on the 10,000 validation instances unseen during training in Table 12. Next, we show the average LM performance (on the 9 classification benchmarks) where we perform unlearning on the LM on 32 samples until the target token sequences are forgotten (the EL & MA value are both lower than the threshold values) in Table 13. Performance shows the average of 5 random samplings."
"Why not just use membership inference attack recall [1,2] and exposure metric [3], which are commonly used and established metrics? These two basically do what the currently proposed metrics do.","YOLOv3 has limitations in terms of object alignment and performance on medium to large size objects, and struggles with the COCO average AP metric between.5 and.95 IOU","These metrics are dependent on the specific attacks, while ours is agnostic of the type of attack.","Previous work that explores to which extent LMs have memorized their training data approach the phenomenon with two different viewpoints. Some work view memorization of LMs simply as a threat to individual privacy (Carlini et al., 2021; 2022; Jagielski et al., 2022) and utilize metrics that quantify how much the LMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks. These metrics are mostly dependent on the specific types of attacks such as the membership inference attack (Shokri et al., 2017) and measure the privacy risks of LMs by quantifying the success rate of these attacks."
How was the value of n set to 10?,"Modifying the attention weights through fixed or masked attention allows for injecting patterns into the model, but beyond simple addition, more sophisticated techniques can be used to apply patterns back to the original model. These include:

1. Pattern-aware attention: Instead of fixing or masking the attention weights, the patterns can be incorporated into the attention mechanism itself. For example, using pattern-aware attention weights that depend on the input sequence and the predicted pattern.
2. Pattern-based regularization: Regularizing the model with a pattern-based loss function that encourages the model to produce outputs consistent with the predicted patterns.
3. Pattern-aware input embedding: Injecting patterns into the input embedding layer, so that the model is aware of the patterns from the very beginning.
4. Pattern-based output transformation: Applying patterns to the output of the model, for example, by using pattern-based post-processing techniques to modify the output of the model",The n value is set to 10 because we consider an extraction attack to be successfuly when 10 token sequences are successfully extracted by the LM.,"We set the n value to 10 since we empirically consider an extraction to be successful when 10 consecutive token sequences are successfully generated by the LM. We show varying the n with values from [5,10,20,40] in Appendix H."
What happens when we perform unlearning for really big LMs?,Yes,Larger LMs are stronger unlearners because they take fewer epochs for forgetting specific target token sequences and retains most of its previous capabilities compared to smaler LMs.,"We highlight five main observations regarding the results. (1) OPT LMs show a much lower EL10 and MA than GPT-NEO LMs, confirming that deduplicating the pretraining corpora is indeed helpful for mitigating privacy risks. (2) NEO + DPD+ enables effective protection against extraction attacks demonstrated via the lowest EL and MA score; however, it brings severe degradation of generation capabilities measured via the Average F1 score of the 4 dialogue generation tasks. (3) NEO + UL+ results in severe degradation of both classification and dialogue tasks for the 125M, only severe degradation of dialogue tasks for 1.3B LM while for the 2.7B LMs, it enables retaining most of its previous capabilities. (4) While the LMs scale to larger sizes, it takes fewer epochs for the target sequences to be forgotten. Together with (3), this implies that larger LMs are strong unlearners. (5) While NEO + UL+ provides stronger privacy protection than OPT without sacrificing its performance from NEO for the 2.7B LM, it is much more computationally efficient (3,500,000x) than re-training the underlying LM, which is required for all data preprocessing approaches."
What does the author mean by “empirically” consider some token sequences to be forgotten? ,Computational cost,"Since the forgetting definition is dependent on a held-out validation corpora, it is considered 'empirically' forgotten.","By utilizing both \textsc{EL}_{n} and MA, we empirically define a specific token sequence \bm{x} to be forgotten and is no longer susceptible to extraction attacks when the following conditions are met: where D^{\prime} represents a validation corpora not seen during training. In other words, we define \bm{x} to be forgotten when the \textsc{EL}_{n}(\bm{x}) and MA(\bm{x}) reach a value that is lower than the average \textsc{EL}_{n} and MA on token sequences that were not seen during training."
What was Memorization Accuracy Metric first used to quantify? ,"MobileNets are primarily built on depthwise separable convolutions and are designed to optimize for latency, yielding small and efficient models",MA was first used to quantify the training dynamics of large LMs.,MA quantifies how much f_{\theta} has memorized the given token sequences and was proposed by Tirumala et al. (2022) to analyze the training dynamics of large LMs.
What is the reason the standard deviation is not shown in the table?,"Assuming unobserved user-item pairs negative leads to limited performance for generative methods because it becomes less valid as user-item interactions get sparser, and the uncertainty of supervision degrades the performance for top-K recommendation",The standard deviation is not shown in the table because it is shown in the Appendix.,"For the actual target data used to quantify the privacy risks of the LMs, we sample instances from the Training Data Extraction Challenge 111https://github.com/google-research/lm-extraction-benchmark where 15,000 examples (each are 200 token sequences long) from 16 different domains of the Pile corpora that are identified to be somewhat easy-to-extract are provided. For our experiments, we randomly sample s samples from the 15,000 examples and make the underlying LM forget the s samples at once. As a default, we show the average results of 5 random samplings of s samples for all of our experimental settings. We only provide the average of the 5 samplings and do not separately report the standard deviation. Instead, we provide the results of each individual run in Appendix A."
How is the proposed work different from the previous works using Transformer-based VAE frameworks in terms of representation learning? ,"Five-fold cross-validation (CV) and leave-one-patient-out (LOO) are both methods for evaluating the performance of a model on unseen data, but they differ in how they partition the data for training and testing. In CV, the data is partitioned into five folds, and the model is trained and tested on each fold in turn, with the remaining four folds used for validation. In LOO, the data is partitioned such that each sample is used as a test set once, and the remaining samples are used for validation. LOO is generally considered a more stringent evaluation method, as it does not use any data from the test set for validation","The proposed work is different from previous studies using Transformer-based VAE frameworks, which achieves representation including global or hierarchical information of the given data, in that the learned representation is disentangled according to domain-specific inductive bias to control generated chords.","We concretely use the variational Transformer inspired by Lin et al. [22]. They used a Transformer-based model extended by a conditional VAE framework to gener- ate a response from a conditional context . We leverage this seq2seq architecture to achieve a variational neural machine translation (VNMT) from a given melody to the chords [23]–[25]. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to apply the VNMT approach to music generation. In particular, our approach is different from previous music generation studies using the variational Transformer, which mostly served as an autoencoder [26], [27]. Furthermore, we attempt to regularize the variational Transformer for controlling the chord outputs through a dis- entangled representation. Generating arbitrary sets of chords may not satisfy users who would like to create music based on their own tastes. In terms of building interactive music gen- eration systems as well as learning a good representation for sequential data, controllable generation with the VAE frame- work has mainly been approached by recent studies. These studies have aimed to learn disentangled representations for high-level musical features, such as pitch, rhythm, harmony, context, or arousal, through supervised learning [28]–[31]. Inspired by these studies, we use domain-speciﬁc induc- tive bias to achieve a disentangled representation for the well-summarized context of the target melody and chords. Furthermore, Choi et al. [26] proposed a Transformer-based autoencoder that achieved global representation for the musical contexts of polyphonic piano performance data. Jiang et al. [27] introduced a hierarchical Transformer VAE to learn context-sensitive melody representation with self-"
Why would melody harmonization task be important for understanding human composition?,"Yes, \delta is a hyperparameter",A melody harmonization task is important for understanding human composition since it aims to capture the long-term dependencies in music by constraining sets of chord progressions that can interact with a given melody.,"A melody harmonization task requires capturing the long-term dependencies in music since a constrained sets of chord progressions can consistently interact with a given melody [4]. This has motivated the use of linguistic tech- niques such as context-free grammar [5], genetic algo- rithms [6], or hidden Markov models (HMMs) [3], [7], [8]."
What is the benefit of using note-based representation over grid-based representations?,"By letting the stacked nonlinear layers fit a residual mapping instead of the original mapping, the deep residual learning framework addresses the degradation problem in deep convolutional neural networks","Note-based representation is better than grid-based representation in learning chord patterns. The reason is that learning with the grid-based representation can result in generating chord progression with ambiguous patterns or hierarchies. On the other hand, modeling the note-based representation can capture note patterns in a melody.","where e T , e N , S , and N denote the time-level embed- ding vectors, note-level embedding vectors, STHarm, and the number of melody notes, respectively, Embedding and Self-AttBlocks denote the embedding layer and L multi- head self-attention blocks that are identical to the vanilla Transformer, respectively [12], w ∗ denotes a sinusoidal posi- tional embedding scaled by a trainable weight [40], and TimeToNote is a novel method that we propose to convert the timewise embedding to the notewise embedding to capture the note patterns in a melody. Nevertheless, these LSTM-based studies had limitations in generating concrete chord structures. First, the models were unable to encode an original melodic structure despite their sequential architectures [4]. The notes in a melody were aggregated within a chord duration into a pitch-class histogram before being fed to the model. Second, the models did not explicitly consider capturing the patterns of chord pro- gressions. Chord labels correspond to the constant time grids (e.g., a bar or half-bar). Sequential modeling of grid-based chord labels is likely to result in ambiguous patterns or hier- archies of the generated outputs [8]."
The authors claim that LSTM-based approaches have failed to capture realistic pattern of chords. Is it true?,"The images were not selected randomly, but were picked by the authors","LSTM-based approaches have failed to capture realistic patterns of chords due to two reasons. The first reason is that they cannot encode an original melodic structure by aggregating melody notes for each chord into a pitch-class histogram before being fed to the model. The second reason is that they capture ambiguous patterns or hierarchies in chord progressions since they recurrently model grid-based chord labels. Empirically, it has been investigated that the LSTM-based models tend to generate some syncopated chord rhythms that can weaken the metrical boundaries, unlike real-world music.","Nevertheless, these LSTM-based studies had limitations in generating concrete chord structures. First, the models were unable to encode an original melodic structure despite their sequential architectures [4]. The notes in a melody were aggregated within a chord duration into a pitch-class histogram before being fed to the model.

Sequential modeling of grid-based chord labels is likely to result in ambiguous patterns or hier- archies of the generated outputs [8]. Figs. 4 and 5 show some of the actual samples from the listening test for all ﬁve models as well as the human- composed music. These samples reveal the strengths of the proposed models. First, Fig. 4 mainly shows that the proposed models tend to reproduce the binary metrical structure of the chords compared to the baseline models. The binary metric structure is close to real-world music, most of which has been composed of four beats and strongly inﬂuenced by metrical boundaries [52]. In contrast, the chords generated from the baseline models show some syncopated rhythms, which can weaken the metrical boundaries. Fig. 5 illustrates another advantage of the proposed models, which is that the majority of the chord roots tend to shift in intervals either of perfect fourth or ﬁfth according to the circle-of- ﬁfths rule. This aspect reﬂects conventional Western music theory, which serves as domain knowledge for modeling real-world music [51], [54]. Moreover, the proposed models are shown to generate some natural chromatic progressions according to the given melody. On the other hand, the baseline models show some short transitions on the circle-of-ﬁfths at arbitrary spots, in contrast to the melody with regular phrasings."
"Is TimeToNote method truly a novel idea to capture a musical hierarchy? It seems to be just a simple trick that also have been used in one of the previous music generation studies (MuseMorphose, 2021).","Hard attention models select one patch of the image to attend to at a time, while soft attention models place weights ""softly"" over all patches in the source image","TimeToNote method is different from similar approaches to capture musical hierarchy. First, it aims to aggregate grid-based information into musically meaningful units, while previous approaches map low-level musical units to high-level musical units, such as a bar. Moreover, the aggregated information preserves the length information of the original representation, which is also different from the previous studies that simply average-pooled the representation.","In the Time2Note procedure, we add the scaled positional embedding w T to e (S) T . Then, we transfer it to the notewise embedding e (S) N with average pooling by an alignment matrix M ∈ { 0 , 1 } T × N as (2), where M indicates the alignment path between a piano roll and a series of notes. This process enables each frame of the notewise embedding to preserve the information of the original note duration : However, conventional Transformer-based studies encoded music as a series of musical events [15]. Using event-based representations differs from how humans perceive a rendered or score-written melody for harmonization [16]. Instead, a grid-based melody representation can be more intuitive for modeling melodic patterns synchronized with chord labels [4], [17], [18]. In our work, we convert a melody into a more intuitive note-based representation, where each frame represents one note. To this end, we use a novel time-to-note compression method to map a binary piano roll representation into a note-based embedding."
"What does ""global key signature"" mean?","Sure! Here's my answer:

The non-pretrained Transformer-based models eventually reach optimal performance, but the ELMO-based non-pretrained models struggle with learning both tasks.

Reason: The non-pretrained Transformer-based models are able to learn the tasks with many fewer labeled examples compared to the ELMO-based models, suggesting that the pretraining task used for ELMO may not have been effective in capturing the relevant information for these tasks","""Global key signature"" means the harmonic context of music that is constrained to a certain range. For example, the C major key is constrained to have functionally important chords such as C, G, and F major chords.","The proposed architecture of VTHarm is inspired by [22]. VTHarm has an additional probabilistic encoder for a latent variable z , where z represents the global attribute of the aggregated melody and chords. We denote this encoder as the context encoder . We add a global key signature label as a conditional input token to the model. The key signature is essential for an arbitrary melody to obtain a certain harmonic context [41]. The key signature token can aid the model in specifying the latent space and sampling the outputs from the human-composed samples from CMD and HLSD include 72 different chord types with various amounts of musical tensions. 2) STHarm may generate common chords more fre- quently from the average chord distribution than the human- composed music, as shown in the lower diversity scores. Concretely, the most frequent chords in real-world music are diatonic chords such as the C, G, and F major chords in the C major key [9]. Since these chords have relatively less musical tension with respect to a melody, they are close to the melody under a music-theoretical space. Thus, these chords may obtain better coherence scores than other chords with more musical tension. Moreover, Human shows lower diversity scores than the variational models. We assume that this is because these mod- els can produce some infrequent chords far from the mean distribution of real-world music. The nature of stochastic generation models draws samples from the normal distribu- tion [49]. Some of the generated chords may violate the given key signature but increase the information outside the certain harmonic context. Hence, they may contribute to higher chord diversity than human-composed music. We conduct an ablation study to verify the beneﬁt of adding the conditional token c to VTHarm and rVTHarm. We assume that c provides key signature information that can efﬁciently constrain the latent space to a concrete harmonic context, improving the chord structuredness and reconstruction per- formance of the model. We compute the chord similarity metrics between the ground truth and generated chords from the VT models according to the presence of c . The results are demonstrated in Table 7. This table shows that the VT models without c mostly obtain worse scores for all similarity metrics than the models with c . This indicates that adding key signature information to the VT models in most cases not only enhances the one-by-one accuracy but also improves the structure of the generated chords to be more human-like."
"How ""chord coverage"" can represent chord complexity, which cannot be simply defined without considering the human perception of music?","The author chose the RWPE model to compare the effective k value because it is a widely used and effective absolute positional representation that can be easily combined with the self-attention mechanism, and because it is learnable and can capture complex positional information","""Chord coverage"" can represent chord complexity, as the corresponding scores are empirically correlated to ""Complexity"" scores that are collected by human participants during the listening test. ""Complexity"" metric represents how complex a human listener perceives the chord progression to be.","We expand the conventional criteria [10], [11] for deeper analysis of human judgment. Harmonicity measures how coherent the chords are with a given melody. Unexpected- ness measures how much the chords deviate from expecta- tion. Complexity measures how complex chord progression is perceived to be. Preference measures personal favor for chord progression [9]. Moreover, Human shows lower diversity scores than the variational models. We assume that this is because these mod- els can produce some infrequent chords far from the mean distribution of real-world music. The nature of stochastic generation models draws samples from the normal distribu- tion [49]. Some of the generated chords may violate the given key signature but increase the information outside the certain harmonic context. Hence, they may contribute to higher chord diversity than human-composed music. Table 5 shows that the results mainly support the quantitative evaluation results. In contrast, STHarm shows the highest H score regardless of melody awareness. This suggests that STHarm outputs plausible chords to listen to than the baseline models. For U and C, VTHarm shows the highest scores,"
Why does the objective for STHarm not include condition c?,"No. The ""memory of cases"" refers to a set of key-value pairs where the keys are misunderstood questions and the values are the corresponding user feedback to correct those misunderstandings. The model is able to leverage this memory to correct its mistakes on new, unseen examples. The prompt itself does not contain all of these cases as examples, but rather the model is able to use the memory to inform its understanding of the task","The objective of STHarm does not include condition c as it aims to find mean distribution for chords that maximizes the likelihood given a certain melody. STHarm may generate the chords that share the best-fit harmonic context with the melody through its objective. Therefore, STHarm does not need extra information that constrains the harmonic context to better predict harmonically coherent chords.","constrained chord distributions. In contrast, STHarm does not use this token since it ﬁnds the mean distribution for chords that best ﬁt a given melody. The main objective for STHarm is maximizing the log likelihood of the estimated chord sequence y given the melody x : human-composed samples from CMD and HLSD include 72 different chord types with various amounts of musical tensions. 2) STHarm may generate common chords more frequently from the average chord distribution than the human-composed music, as shown in the lower diversity scores. Concretely, the most frequent chords in real-world music are diatonic chords such as the C, G, and F major chords in the C major key [9]. Since these chords have relatively less musical tension with respect to a melody, they are close to the melody under a music-theoretical space. Thus, these chords may obtain better coherence scores than other chords with more musical tension."
What is the benifit of using the HLSD dataset that does not contain various key signatures for evaluating the models?,No,"Using the HLSD dataset without transposing to various key signatures, we can reproduce the baseline model performance with the same dataset setting to the previous studies and verify the proposed models compared to the baseline performance. Therefore, it is beneficial over only using a new dataset.","HLSD [13] is an online database of melody and chord annota- tions that cover various genres, such as the pop, new age, and original soundtracks. This dataset has been constructed on a crowdsourcing platform called TheoryTab, 1 in which users have transcribed a large number of high quality melodies and chords. This dataset contains the raw annotations of melodies and chords in XML format, JSON data of the symbolic fea- tures of melodies and chords, and piano-roll ﬁgures depicting the melody and chords. We use the JSON data for 9,218 songs divided into 13,335 parts. We also normalize all songs into C major or C minor, as in previous studies [10], [11]. Fol- lowing Sun et al. [11], we use 500 parts for the test set and the other 500 parts for the validation set. As a result, we use 32,619, 1,346, and 809 samples for the training, validation, and test sets, respectively."
Were the baseline models implemented from scratch or from existing codes from the original authors?,Training time and test time efficiency,"The baseline models are implemented from scratch, where the experimental settings are referred to the original settings in the corresponding papers.","The models are implemented and evaluated in Python 3 and the PyTorch deep learning framework of version 1.5.0. For training each model, we use one NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. We mostly refer to the previous implemen- tations [40], [48] when implementing the vanilla Trans- former. For implementing and training BLSTM and ONADE, we use the original settings [9], [11]. The gradients are all clipped to 1 for the learning stability during training of all models. VTHarm, rVTHarm, and ONADE are assessed with 10 test samples per melody due to their randomness."
The authors seem to mention specific reasons only for lambda KL. Did the authors conduct any ablation study to decide lambda Reg? ,8 residual connections are used in the model architecture described in the paper,Lambda Reg has been empirically set to 1 through several trials with various values. The concrete results of such a process are not reported in the paper.,"The embedding sizes of the melody and chord are 128 and 256, respectively. We use a hidden size of 256, attention head size of 4, number of attention blocks L of 4, and size of the latent variable z of 16. A dropout layer is used after every scaled positional encoding at a rate of 0.2. We use an Adam optimizer [46] with an initial learning rate of 1e-4, which is reduced to 95% after every epoch. We train the proposed models for 100 epochs with a batch size of 128. To select the value of λ KL , we refer to several studies on VAE-based music generation in which a scaling weight smaller than 1 encour- ages better reconstruction [21], [47]. Then, we empirically set λ KL and λ Reg to be 0.1 and 1, respectively, which results in the best performance."
What is the difference between TPSD anc DICD?,Yes,"TPSD is based on the relationship of two adjacent chords in terms of the circle-of-fifths rule and the shared pitch-class indices in the four levels of the tonic space. On the other hand, DICD is based on the pitch-class intervals between the two adjacent chords.","distance (DICD) measure the distance between two chord progressions: • Tonal pitch step distance (TPSD). TPSD computes the geometrical dissimilarity between the generated chords and the ground-truth chords in terms of the tonal pitch space (TPS) chord distance rule [53]. The TPS between chord x and chord y is computed as (16): where j is the least number of steps in one direction from the chordal root of x to that of y according to the circle-of-ﬁfths rule. In the circle-of-ﬁfths rule, all pitch classes are arranged in intervals of either perfect ﬁfth or fourth [54]. The variable k is the number of unique pitch class indices in the four levels (root, ﬁfths, triadic, diatonic) within the basic space of y compared to x [53]. That is, if the pitch class index is shared by y and x , it is not counted. We compute the TPS values between all pairs of adjacent chords within each progression, DICD computes the city block distance between the directed interval class (DIC) representation vectors for the chord transitions [55]. DIC is the histogram vector of the directional pitch interval classes, ranging from −5 to 6, computed between all pairs of chord notes from the two adjacent chords. We calculate each pitch interval from each note of the first chord to all notes of the"
"Generating average chords and low diversity score are not analogous. Is it true that STHarm generates ""common"" chords that are frequent in real-world music?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

LSTM based auto-encoder models should learn good features because they are designed to retain information about the appearance of objects and the background, as well as the motion contained in the video, while preventing the model from learning an identity mapping and effectively copying the input to the output","STHarm may have generated ""common"" chords that are frequent in real-world music. Harmonicity and Preference scores are the highest for the STHarm, regardless of melody awareness, and those scores are evaluated by the human listeners who usually have listened to popular music where common chords are used.","Table 5 shows that the results mainly support the quantita- tive evaluation results. In contrast, STHarm shows the highest H score regardless of melody awareness. This suggests that STHarm outputs plausible chords to listen to than the baseline models. For U and C, VTHarm shows the highest scores, and the variational models show lower harmonicity and prefer- ence scores than STHarm. We assume that the variational models tend to generate more chords far from the mean distribution of the learned music data than STHarm. Such unique chords can reveal more inharmonicity than the fre- quent chords, and it may have provided the participants with unpleasant feelings. In addition, most participants listened to popular music, where common chords with less musical tension are used. Therefore, it may have led the participants providing poorer scores on preference as well as harmonicity. Nevertheless, VTHarm shows a better P score than ONADE with lower U and C scores. This means that VTHarm is more persuasive than the baseline model with lower chord complexity."
How is a harmonic similarity to human music connected to the structuredness of chord patterns?,The filter concatenation stage of the Inception architecture was replaced with residual connections,A harmonic similarity to human music is connected to the structuredness of chord patterns because human-composed music is a ground truth representing the music that is well-structured and the objective of this paper is fundamentally generating chords similar to real-world music.,We investigate the harmonic similarity between the human-composed and generated chords. We use the samples from Human as the ground truth. This explicit comparison with Human can provide insight into whether the generated chords from each model are as well-structured as human- composed music [8].
Why can't training VTHarm guarantee a disentangled representation of the desired aspect? ,"The authors conclude that the thinness of structures is causing regions to be masked improperly because the traditional toolchain relies on accurate image correspondence, which is difficult to establish in areas of low texture and thin structures","VTHarm cannot guarantee a disentangled representation of the desired aspect because it does not aim a supervised learning that can decouple the representation by the high-level musical features. Empirically, the learned representation from VTHarm has been shown to be less correlated to the target chord attribute than rVTHarm which regularizes the representation.","Furthermore, we attempt to regularize the variational Transformer for controlling the chord outputs through a dis- entangled representation. Generating arbitrary sets of chords may not satisfy users who would like to create music based on their own tastes. In terms of building interactive music gen- eration systems as well as learning a good representation for sequential data, controllable generation with the VAE frame- work has mainly been approached by recent studies. These studies have aimed to learn disentangled representations for high-level musical features, such as pitch, rhythm, harmony, context, or arousal, through supervised learning [28]–[31]. Inspired by these studies, we use domain-speciﬁc induc- tive bias to achieve a disentangled representation for the well-summarized context of the target melody and chords. Furthermore, we compute Pearson’s correlation coefﬁ- cients between α and the CC scores of the corresponding chord outputs. Table 4 shows that rVTHarm reveals higher correlation coefﬁcients than VTHarm for all datasets. This conﬁrms that rVTHarm derives a meaningful representation for the intended chord attribute compared to VTHarm."
What would be a proper measure to quantize how the attention maps differ by a value of alpha?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

SNLI is a dataset, not a model. It stands for Stanford Natural Language Inference dataset, which is a collection of labeled text pairs used for training and evaluating natural language inference models",The proposed measure to quantize how the attention maps differ by a value of alpha would be one of the metrics that detect the diagonality of the matrix.,"In addition, we examine the attention maps of rVTHarm with different values of α . We randomly sample z , where α is set to be one of {− 3 , 0 , 3 } , and generate the chords from z and the test melodies. We sum the attention matrices along the head dimension to see the aggregated weights. Fig. 3 shows that the attention weights become balanced and diagonal when α increases from − 3 to 3. This implies that the decoder of rVTHarm tends to focus on more melody notes when α increases."
What is the reason to select these three values for alpha?,"For the citation dataset, the experiment uses a static graph, while for the Reddit dataset, the experiment uses an evolving graph","The alpha has been selected to be one of {-3, 0, 3} since {-3, 3} can be the two extremes for the prior that is assumed to be the normal distribution, where the range from -3 to 3 includes 99.7% of the probability distribution.","where V denotes VTHarm, Concatd denotes the concatenation over the feature dimension, Pool denotes the average pooling over time, and self-AttBlock denotes only one loop of"
"What is the benefit of rVTHarm compared to VTHarm, although it does not show the best scores in any of the metrics in Table 5?","Sure! Here's my answer:

Both map point matches and visual odometry matches are required because they serve different purposes in localization. Map point matches ensure drift-free localization to the existing map, while visual odometry matches make the localization robust to unmapped regions","rVTHarm is better than VTHarm in that it can control the desired attribute of chords with the latent representation while VTHarm is not guaranteed for controllable generation of the chords. Although rVTHarm does not show the best scores in any metrics for the listening test, it shows higher preference scores than VTHarm with melody awareness. Practically, the melody would be aware by the user as the melody is intentionally created or memorized by the user, hence the strength of rVTHarm in the situation with melody awareness can be more helpful than VTHarm.","Training VTHarm alone cannot guarantee a disentangled representation of the desired aspect. Therefore, rVTHarm aims to achieve a disentangled representation to control the generated chord outputs. We use the auxiliary loss by Pati et al. [32] to directly supervise the latent representation z . In this study, we choose the number of unique chords in the progression, or chord coverage , as a naive attribute for the chord complexity [10]. Furthermore, we compute Pearson’s correlation coefﬁ- cients between α and the CC scores of the corresponding chord outputs. Table 4 shows that rVTHarm reveals higher correlation coefﬁcients than VTHarm for all datasets. This conﬁrms that rVTHarm derives a meaningful representation for the intended chord attribute compared to VTHarm. When the melody is unaware, BLSTM and rVTHarm obtain significantly lower Preference scores than when the melody is aware (p < 0.001). We further compute Pearson’s correlation coefficient of U with C or P scores, as shown in Table 6. As a result, rVTHarm reveals the most negative correlation of U with both C and P scores when the melody is aware. This indicates that 1) controlled chords"
Is it valid to conclude that the baseline models are weaker than the proposed models since they generate some syncopated rhythms of chords?,"Sure! Here are two examples of conventional image descriptors that can be used for object detection and segmentation in medical image analysis:

SIFT and HOG",The baseline models can be concluded to be weaker than the proposed models in that they generate some syncopated rhythms of chords which are not close to real-world music which is mostly composed of four or binary beats for a bar and strongly influenced by metrical boundaries.,"Figs. 4 and 5 show some of the actual samples from the listening test for all ﬁve models as well as the human- composed music. These samples reveal the strengths of the proposed models. First, Fig. 4 mainly shows that the proposed models tend to reproduce the binary metrical structure of the chords compared to the baseline models. The binary metric structure is close to real-world music, most of which has been composed of four beats and strongly inﬂuenced by metrical boundaries [52]. In contrast, the chords generated from the baseline models show some syncopated rhythms, which can weaken the metrical boundaries. Fig. 5 illustrates another advantage of the proposed models, which is that the majority of the chord roots tend to shift in intervals either of perfect fourth or ﬁfth according to the circle-of- ﬁfths rule. This aspect reﬂects conventional Western music theory, which serves as domain knowledge for modeling real-world music [51], [54]. Moreover, the proposed models are shown to generate some natural chromatic progressions according to the given melody. On the other hand, the baseline models show some short transitions on the circle-of-ﬁfths at arbitrary spots, in contrast to the melody with regular phrasings."
"In the decoder input, what is the ""beginning"" over which the latent variable z and the key signature token c are added? Is it a <bos> token?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Without label smoothing, the results and performance are worse than with label smoothing","The ""beginning"" of the decoder input is a sum of the latent variable z and the key signature token c, which is concatenated over the sequence dimension. The concatenated embeddings are not added to any embedding such as that for the <bos> token.","The encoder used in VTHarm is identical to the encoder used in STHarm, except that the conditional token c is con- catenated at the beginning of the note-based melody embed- where V denotes VTHarm, Concat d denotes the concatena- tion over the feature dimension, Pool denotes the average pooling over time, and self-AttBlock denotes only one loop of the self-attention block. The context encoder maps the chord input y 1 : O into the embedding e (V) O . Then, c is concatenated at the beginning of e (V) O over the sequence dimension before the multihead self-attention blocks. The self-attention output contains the harmonic context according to the key informa- tion. It is mean-aggregated over time so that it represents the global information of the chords [26]. The encoder output E ( c , x 1 : T ) is also mean aggregated over time to represent the global attribute of a melody. These two aggregated vectors are concatenated over the feature dimension and pass through the bottleneck, resulting in two parameters, µ , and σ . The latent code z is inferred from µ and σ through the reparam- eterization trick, and its prior is assumed to be the normal distribution [19]. The right-shifted chord input is ﬁrst encoded with the same lookup table from the context encoder. The latent variable z and the key signature token c are added to the beginning, which corresponds to the ‘‘start-of-sequence’’ part of the chord embedding. The following attention network transfers the aggregated information from z and c to all frames of the embedding. The rest of the Transformer decoder reconstructs the target chords."
"Key signature may be helpful to constrain harmonic context. Then, wouldn't it be more valid to conduct an ablation study on chord coherence rather than harmonic similarity?",No,It is valid enough to conduct an ablation study on harmonic similarity because constraining the harmonic context fundamentally aims to improve the chord structuredness and reconstruction performance. Constraining the harmonic context with the key signature can help the model specify the latent space and increase the probability to generate the right chord sequence that is close to the human-composed data which is well-structured.,"We conduct an ablation study to verify the beneﬁt of adding the conditional token c to VTHarm and rVTHarm. We assume that c provides key signature information that can efﬁciently constrain the latent space to a concrete harmonic context, improving the chord structuredness and reconstruction per- formance of the model. We compute the chord similarity metrics between the ground truth and generated chords from the VT models according to the presence of c . The results are demonstrated in Table 7. This table shows that the VT models without c mostly obtain worse scores for all similarity metrics than the models with c . This indicates that adding key signature information to the VT models in most cases not only enhances the one-by-one accuracy but also improves the structure of the generated chords to be more human-like. The proposed architecture of VTHarm is inspired by [22]. VTHarm has an additional probabilistic encoder for a latent variable z, where z represents the global attribute of the aggregated melody and chords. We denote this encoder as"
What would be an example of the methods that explore the effect of melody awareness?,"The input images are labelled with a unique identifier and a coarse class descriptor (e.g. cat, dog, watch, etc.) to tether the prior of the class to the subject and leverage the diffusion model's prior for generating new poses and articulations",The method for exploring the effect of melody awareness can be one that deeply investigates how the awareness of the melody can affect the unexpectedness of the controlled chords and how this unexpectedness affects the perceived complexity and preference of the chords.,"When the melody is unaware, BLSTM and rVTHarm obtain signiﬁcantly lower Preference scores than when the melody is aware ( p < 0 . 001). We further compute Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient of U with C or P scores, as shown in Table 6. As a result, rVTHarm reveals the most nega- tive correlation of U with both C and P scores when the melody is aware. This indicates that 1) controlled chords are more unexpected and unpleasant with a familiar melody, and 2) some factors other than complexity seem to cause an increased unexpectedness in rVTHarm. However, the mean preference score of rVTHarm signiﬁcantly increases with melody awareness. This implies that the familiarity of the melody may strongly compensate for the high unexpect- edness of rVTHarm. This tendency needs further investi- gation to improve the robustness of controllable melody harmonization."
"What are some examples of ""explicit planning""?","By fine-tuning the smaller models with the pre-trained attention patterns from the larger models, the smaller models can learn to adapt the patterns to their own architecture and task","An example of ""explicit planning"" would be the plan or strategy of abruptly increasing dynamics for performing a climax within the music to highlight a certain emotion such as anger.","However, these studies have constrained musical creativity. Maezawa et al. controlled musical expression only through quantized features from the musical scores. Tan et al. did not consider controlling tempo or timing with a latent representation. These methods may have restricted any potential for rendering piano performances with flexible musical expression. Musical creativity can be expanded not only by composers but also by performers who can elastically choose various strategies to highlight multiple nuances or emotions [13, 14, 15]. Moreover, the music generation field can be also broadened if static music created by automatic composition systems can be easily colored with realistic and elastic expression [16]."
What is the difference between IsTopVoice and PositionInChord?,"No, the paper's pre-trained network does not use the same training set as the ""AlexNet""",IsTopVoice is different from PositionInChord in that an index 1 of IsTopVoice represents the uppermost voice while that of PositionInChord represents the lowermost voice. They are also different that IsTopVoice is binary while PositionInChord is multi-class.,"Score Features. The features for a musical score represent eight categorical attributes for how the notes are composed:Pitch is a MIDI index number that ranges from 21 to 108.RelDuration and RelIOI are 11-class attributes of a quantized duration and IOI between a note onset and a previous chord, respectively. They range from 1 to 11, and each class represents a multiple of a 16th note’s length with respect to a given tempo [30, 31].IsTopVoice is a binary attribute of whether the note is the uppermost voice. It is heuristically computed regarding pitches and durations of surrounding notes.PositionInChord and NumInChord are 11-class attributes of a positional index of a note within its chord and the total number of notes in that chord, respectively, that range from 1 to 11. An index 1 for PositionInChord denotes the most bottom position.Staff is a binary attribute of the staff of a note, either of the G clef or F clef.IsDownbeat is a binary attribute of whether a note is at a downbeat or not."
"Why didn't the authors intend a ""chord"" to represent a more meaningful unit in music, such as a beat?","The proposed LSTM future predictor model differs from the Ranzato model in that it predicts a long sequence into the future, whereas the Ranzato model only predicts the next frame at each time step","The authors intend a ""chord"" to represent simultaneous notes to intuitively models a polyphonic structure of piano performance that is defined by its temporal progression. More fine-grained resolution than the beat-based resolution can reflect trivial changes in expression that varies by simultaneous note groups, such as a syncopation.","We employ a self-supervised learning framework to force the latent representations to learn our target attributes [25, 26, 24].In addition, we facilitate independent control of the three expressive attributes–dynamics, articulation, and tempo–by utilizing an existing method that aligns the latent code with a target attribute [27, 28]. Finally, we design a novel mechanism that intuitively models a polyphonic structure of piano performance. In particular, we insert intermediate steps for chordwise encoding and decoding of the piano performance to our encoder-decoder architecture, where a chord denotes a group of simultaneous notes. Our approach has several contributions as follows:1) Our system aims to control musical expression while maintaining any characteristics induced by a given musical structure;2) We use self-supervised learning where new supervisory signals are involved in regularizing the latent representations effectively;3) Our system aims to control multiple expressive attributes independently of each other;4) Lastly, we leverage an intermediate step that projects a notewise representation into the chordwise in the middle of our system to intuitively model the polyphonic structure of piano performance. Inspired by previous studies [4, 8, 9, 32], we build a twostep encoder and decoder: An encoder models both notewise and chordwise dependencies of the inputs, and a decoder reconstructs the notewise dependency from the chordwise representation and the notewise condition. We denote a chord as a group of notes that are hit simultaneously, regardless of the staff, so that they sound together at an instant time [33]. Thus, learning the chordwise dependency is analogous to direct modeling of the temporal progression of the piano performance. Let M 2 RC N be a matrix that aligns serialized notes to their polyphonic structure, where C and N are the number of chords and the number of notes, respectively. Within the encoder, the"
Is there no temporal dependency between the latent variable for explicit planning?,"No, the Make-A-Video model does not use text input. Instead, it uses only unlabeled video data and image data to learn the correspondence between text and the visual world. The model is trained on paired text-image data, but not on paired text-video data. The text input is only used to pre-train the prior component of the model, which is then fixed and not fine-tuned on videos. The model generates videos based on the visual content of the input images, without any explicit text input",The latent variable for explicit planning has no temporal dependency. The latent variable is derived from the standard normal distribution without the dependency on the score features.,"Inference. A probabilistic encoder parameterized by \phi approximates the posterior distibutions of the latent representations z^{(\text{pln})} and z^{(\text{str})} from the performance input x and conditional score input y:\displaystyle q_{\phi}(z^{(\text{pln})},z^{(\text{str})}|x,y)=\displaystyle q_{\phi}(z^{(\text{pln})}|x^{(\text{chd})})(3)\displaystyle\prod_{c=1}^{C}q_{\phi}(z^{(\text{str})}_{c}|x^{(\text{chd})}_{\leq c},y^{(\text{chd})}_{\leq c})where x^{(\text{chd})}=\text{N2C}(e_{x}) is the chordwise embedding, and e_{x} is the notewise embedding for x. The posterior distributions of z^{(\text{pln})}_{c} and z^{(\text{str})}_{c} are approximated by distribution parameters encoded by f^{(\text{pln})}(x^{(\text{chd})}) and f^{(\text{str})}(x^{(\text{chd})},y^{(\text{chd})}), where f^{(\text{pln})} and f^{(\text{str})} are bidirectional and unidirectional recurrent neural networks, respectively.We note that z^{(\text{pln})} is independent of the score features y. This allows a flexible transfer of the explicit planning among other musical pieces. On the other hand, z^{(\text{str})} is constrained by y since the structural attributes are dependent on the note structure. Our system can render new piano performances from the scratch given a musical score. It can directly generate expressive parameters from the randomly sampled \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})}\sim p_{\theta}(z^{(\text{pln})}) and \tilde{z}^{(\text{str})}\sim p_{\theta}(z^{(\text{str})}). We note that \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})} does not have temporal dependency: each \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})}_{c} is sampled independently of \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})}_{c-1}. Hence, we need to insert specific values \{\alpha^{(c)}\}_{c=1}^{C}, which we call as ""smooth sketches"", into the target dimensions of z^{(\text{pln})} if any temporal dependency of explicit planning is necessary. Figure 2 shows that the controlled parameters are greatly correlated with \alpha, while their local characteristics follow those of the ground truth. In addition, the black and orange lines together demonstrate granular variety in the parameters induced by different \tilde{z}^{(\text{str})} for the same musical structure. Moreover, Figure 3 shows that our system can estimate explicit planning from arbitrary human performances, indicating that our system can derive relevant information on explicit planning from the unseen data. where y(chd) = N2C(ey) is the chordwise embedding, and ey is the notewise embedding for y. We assume that the prior of z(pln) c is a standard normal distribution. In contrast, z(str) c is sampled from a sequential prior [24, 36, 37], conditioned on both previous latent variables and chordwise score features: z(str) c   N( (prior); diag( (prior)2), where [ (prior);  (prior)] = f(prior)(z(str)"
Why did the authors use a polynomial function to extract explicit planning of the performance data?,"Yes, the paper also mentions tools for expert users","The authors use a polynomial function to extract explicit planning as explicit planning is defined to be a high-level sketch that the performer draws as the bigger plan of progressing musical expression throughout the piece. Such a sketch is assumed to be ""smoothed"" since it would derive from human thought that memorizes or imagines musical expression that can be also represented as an aural form by  ""singing out"" the musical progression.","Prediction Tasks. We extract new supervisory signals for additional prediction tasks from the input data [24]. We define a signal of explicit planning I^{(\text{pln})} as a set of smoothed contours of the expressive parameters. It is extracted as a polynomial function predicted from the chordwise performance parameters k. We also derive a signal of structural attribute as I^{(\text{str})}=\text{sign}(k-I^{(\text{pln})}) which represents normalized directions of the performance parameters.We train two discriminators D^{(\text{pln})} and D^{(\text{str})} that directly receive z^{(\text{pln})} and z^{(\text{str})}, respectively. D^{(\text{pln})} is composed of A sub-discriminators where each discriminator D^{(\text{pln})}_{a} predicts a signal I^{(\text{pln})}_{a} for each expressive attribute a from z^{(\text{pln})}_{a}\in\mathbb{R}^{C\times(d^{(\text{pln})}/A)}, where z^{(\text{pln})}_{a} is a constituent part of z^{(\text{pln})}, and A is the number of expressive attributes. This setting is for a clear disentanglement among the expressive attributes. On the other hand, D^{(\text{str})} predicts the signal I^{(\text{str})} at once for all expressive attributes that belong to the same musical structure. All discriminators are jointly trained with the generative model, and the costs \mathcal{L}_{\text{pln}} and \mathcal{L}_{\text{str}} are minimized as \mathcal{L}_{\text{pln}}=\frac{1}{A}\sum_{a}\text{MSE}(D^{(\text{pln})}_{a}(z^{(\text{pln})}_{a}),I^{(\text{pln})}_{a}) and \mathcal{L}_{\text{str}}=\text{MSE}(D^{(\text{str})}(z^{(\text{str})}),I^{(\text{str})}), respectively. Therefore, we attempt a new approach that renders piano performances with flexible musical expressions. We disregard a typical assumption from previous studies that a performer must follow a composer’s intent [17, 18, 19, 4]. According to the literature, performers learn to identify or imitate ""expressive models"", or explicit planning, of existing piano performances [20]. We focus on this attribute, defining it as a higher-level sketch of the expressive attributes (i.e. dynamics, articulation, and tempo [21]) that the performer draws based on a personal interpretation of the musical piece [20, 4, 11]. We also assume that the remaining attribute represents common performing strategies that are connected to certain musical patterns, while these strategies slightly differ across performers [22, 23]. We call this attribute as a structural attribute that belongs to given note structures of a musical piece."
Why did the authors use only one composer rather than several composers together?,Yes,"The authors use only one composer, Chopin, rather than several composers together because Chopin's music has been one of the most common resources that are analyzed by literature to investigate the development in Western musical expression with respect to various musical structures. In other words, modeling music only from Chopin is assumed to be enough for learning Western musical expression derived from various musical patterns.","We use Yamaha e-Competition Dataset [8] and Vienna 4x22 Piano Corpus [40]. From these datasets, we collect 356 performances of 34 pieces by Frédéric Chopin, which have been representative research subjects for analyzing the Western musical expression [22, 41, 6, 42]. We use 30 pieces (108,738 batches) for training and the rest for testing. To verify the generality of model performances, we also collect the external dataset from ASAP dataset [43]. We use 116 performances for 23 pieces by 10 composers who represent various eras of Western music.

The methods of ""one-to-many augmentation"" such as data augmentation and 3D face reconstruction have been shown to effectively improve the performance of deep FR algorithms in terms of accuracy and diversity of training data.

We qualitatively evaluate the base quality of the samples that have flat expressions, so that quality judgments are independent of any preference of arbitrary explicit planning. We generate each sample using z^{(\text{pln})}_{0}. A listening test is composed of 30 trials where each participant chooses a more ""human-like"" sample out of the generated sample and its plain MIDI [9].

It can directly generate expressive parameters from the randomly sampled \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})}\sim p_{\theta}(z^{(\text{pln})}) and \tilde{z}^{(\text{str})}\sim p_{\theta}(z^{(\text{str})}). We note that \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})} does not have temporal dependency: each \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})}_{c} is sampled independently of \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})}_{c-1}. Hence, we need to insert specific values \{\alpha^{(c)}\}_{c=1}^{C}, which we call as ""smooth sketches"", into the target dimensions of z^{(\text{pln})} if any temporal dependency of explicit planning is necessary. Figure 2 shows that the controlled parameters are greatly correlated with \alpha, while their local characteristics follow those of the ground truth. In addition, the black and orange lines together demonstrate granular variety in the parameters induced by different \tilde{z}^{(\text{str})} for the same musical structure. Moreover, Figure 3 shows that our system can estimate explicit planning from arbitrary human performances, indicating that our system can derive relevant information on explicit planning from the unseen data."
What is the difference between conducting polynomial regression and predicting explicit planning with the learned representation?,103 million words,"Conducting polynomial regression is different from predicting explicit planning from the learned representation since polynomial regression would be based on a finite set of data in a certain length. In other words, different lengths of the input data of the polynomial function can result in different polynomial curves. On the other hand, the prediction of explicit planning from the latent representation is not affected by the input length.","Prediction Tasks. We extract new supervisory signals for additional prediction tasks from the input data [24]. We define a signal of explicit planning I^{(\text{pln})} as a set of smoothed contours of the expressive parameters. It is extracted as a polynomial function predicted from the chordwise performance parameters k. We also derive a signal of structural attribute as I^{(\text{str})}=\text{sign}(k-I^{(\text{pln})}) which represents normalized directions of the performance parameters.We train two discriminators D^{(\text{pln})} and D^{(\text{str})} that directly receive z^{(\text{pln})} and z^{(\text{str})}, respectively. D^{(\text{pln})} is composed of A sub-discriminators where each discriminator D^{(\text{pln})}_{a} predicts a signal I^{(\text{pln})}_{a} for each expressive attribute a from z^{(\text{pln})}_{a}\in\mathbb{R}^{C\times(d^{(\text{pln})}/A)}, where z^{(\text{pln})}_{a} is a constituent part of z^{(\text{pln})}, and A is the number of expressive attributes. This setting is for a clear disentanglement among the expressive attributes. On the other hand, D^{(\text{str})} predicts the signal I^{(\text{str})} at once for all expressive attributes that belong to the same musical structure. All discriminators are jointly trained with the generative model, and the costs \mathcal{L}_{\text{pln}} and \mathcal{L}_{\text{str}} are minimized as \mathcal{L}_{\text{pln}}=\frac{1}{A}\sum_{a}\text{MSE}(D^{(\text{pln})}_{a}(z^{(\text{pln})}_{a}),I^{(\text{pln})}_{a}) and \mathcal{L}_{\text{str}}=\text{MSE}(D^{(\text{str})}(z^{(\text{str})}),I^{(\text{str})}), respectively."

Why does negative transfer occur when learning with auxiliary tasks? ,Multiple smaller width kernels,"Negative transfer happens when the learning of an auxiliary task negatively impacts the performance of the primary task. In the case of graph-based tasks, it can happen because the graph structure, such as the number of nodes, edges, and diameter, can be vastly different between domains. This causes confusion for the model, resulting in poor generalization of the primary task.","Pre-training with an auxiliary task is a common technique for deep neural networks.Indeed, it is the de facto standard step in natural language processing and computer vision to learn a powerful backbone networks such as BERT devlin2018bert  and ResNet he2016deep  leveraging large datasets such as BooksCorpus zhu2015aligning , English Wikipedia, and ImageNet deng2009imagenet .The models trained on the auxiliary task are often beneficial for the primary (target) task of interest.Despite the success of pre-training, few approaches have been generalized to graph-structured data due to their fundamental challenges.First, graph structure (e.g., the number of nodes/edges, and diameter) and its meaning can significantly differ between domains. So the model trained on an auxiliary task can harm generalization on the primary task, i.e., negative transfer pan2009survey .Also, many graph neural networks are transductive approaches. This often makes transfer learning between datasets inherently infeasible.So, pre-training on the target dataset has been proposed using auxiliary tasks: graph kernel  navarin2018pre , graph reconstruction zhang2020graph , and attribute masking  hu2020strategies . These assume that the auxiliary tasks for pre-training are carefully selected with substantial domain knowledge and expertise in graph characteristics to assist the primary task.Since most graph neural networks operate on homogeneous graphs, which have a single type of nodes and edges, the previous pre-training/auxiliary tasksare not specifically designed for heterogeneous graphs, which have multiple types of nodes and edges.Heterogeneous graphs commonly occur in real-world applications, for instance, a music dataset has multiple types of nodes (e.g., user, song, artist) and multiple types of relations (e.g., user-artist, song-film, song-instrument). Our framework SELAR is learning to learn a primary task with multiple auxiliary tasks to assist the primary task.This can be formally written asmin𝐰,Θ⁡𝔼⁢[ℒp⁢r⁢(𝐰∗⁢(Θ))](x,y)∼Dp⁢r⁢ s.t. ⁢𝐰∗⁢(Θ)=arg⁡min𝐰⁡𝔼⁢[ℒp⁢r+a⁢u⁢(𝐰;Θ)](x,y)∼Dp⁢r+a⁢u,\displaystyle\min_{\mathbf{w},\Theta}\;\;\underset{(x,y)\sim D^{pr}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;}{\text{\large$\mathbb{E}$}\;\;\left[\;\;\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta))\;\;\right]}\;\;\text{ s.t. }\;\;\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)=\operatorname*{\arg\!\min}_{\mathbf{w}}\underset{(x,y)\sim D^{pr+au}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;}{\;\;\mathbb{E}\;\;\left[\;\;\mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w};\Theta)\;\;\right]},roman_min start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_w , roman_Θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_UNDERACCENT ( italic_x , italic_y ) ∼ italic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_UNDERACCENT start_ARG blackboard_E [ caligraphic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( bold_w start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_Θ ) ) ] end_ARG s.t. bold_w start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_Θ ) = start_OPERATOR roman_arg roman_min end_OPERATOR start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_w end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_UNDERACCENT ( italic_x , italic_y ) ∼ italic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r + italic_a italic_u end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_UNDERACCENT start_ARG blackboard_E [ caligraphic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r + italic_a italic_u end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( bold_w ; roman_Θ ) ] end_ARG ,(2)where \mathcal{L}^{pr}(\cdot) is the primary task loss function to evaluate the trained model f(x;\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)) on meta-data (a validation for meta-learning han2018coteaching ) D^{pr} and \mathcal{L}^{pr+au} is the loss function to train a model on training data D^{pr+au} with the primary and auxiliary tasks.

The nested optimization problem given \Theta is a regular training with properly adjusted loss functions to balance the primary and auxiliary tasks.

We overload \ell^{t} with its function value, i.e., \ell^{t}=\ell^{t}(y_{i}^{(t,train)},f^{t}(x_{i}^{(t,train)};\mathbf{w})). \xi^{(t,train)}_{i} is the embedding vector of i_{th} sample for task t. It is the concatenation of one-hot representation of task types, the label of the sample (positive/negative), and its loss value, i.e., \xi^{(t,train)}_{i}=\left[\ell^{t};e_{t};y_{i}^{(t,train)}\right]\in\textbf{R}^{T+2}.To derive our learning algorithm,we first shorten the objective function in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) as \mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)) and \mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w};\Theta).This is equivalent to Eq. (2) without expectation.Then, our formulation is given as\min_{\mathbf{w},\Theta}\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta))\;\;\text{ s.t. }\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)=\operatorname*{\arg\!\min}_{\mathbf{w}}\mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w};\Theta),(5)To circumvent the difficulty of the bi-level optimization, as previous works MAML ; han2018coteaching  in meta-learning we approximate it with the updated parameters \hat{\mathbf{w}} using the gradient descent update as\displaystyle\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)\approx\hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k}(\Theta^{k})=\mathbf{w}^{k}-\alpha\nabla_{\mathbf{w}}\mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w}^{k};\Theta^{k}),(6)where \alpha is the learning rate for \mathbf{w}.We do not numerically evaluate \hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k}(\Theta) instead we plug the computational graph of \hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k} in \mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)) to optimize \Theta.Let \nabla_{\Theta}\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta^{k})) be the gradient evaluated at \Theta^{k}.Then updating parameters \Theta is given as\displaystyle\Theta^{k+1}=\Theta^{k}-\beta\nabla_{\Theta}\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k}(\Theta^{k})),(7)where \beta is the learning rate for \Theta. This update allows softly selecting useful auxiliary tasks (meta-paths) and balance them with the primary task to improve the performance of the primary task. Without balancing tasks with the weighting function \mathcal{V}(\cdot;\Theta), auxiliary tasks can dominate training and degrade the performance of the primary task."
How did the authors design the meta-path prediction task? ,"The limitations of SRCNN in the SISR task are:

1. Relying on the context of small image regions.
2. Training converges too slowly.
3. Only working for a single scale","The authors designed the meta-path prediction task as a variation of link prediction. In meta-path prediction, instead of just predicting links between two nodes, the task is to predict the presence of a specific sequence of heterogeneous composite relations, called a meta-path. The prediction is done in the same way as link prediction, by assigning a binary label (1 or 0) to indicate whether the two nodes are connected by the meta-path. The labels for the task can be generated automatically from the heterogeneous graph, by calculating the product of the adjacency matrices of the edge types in the meta-path.","Meta-path prediction is similar to link prediction but meta-paths allow heterogeneous composite relations.The meta-path prediction can be achieved in the same manner as link prediction.If two nodes u and v are connected by a meta-path p with the heterogeneous edges (t_{1},t_{2},\ldots t_{\ell}), then y_{u,v}^{p}=1, otherwise y_{u,v}^{p}=0. The labels can be generated from a heterogeneous graph without any manual labeling.They can be obtained by A_{p}=A_{t_{l}}\ldots A_{t_{2}}A_{t_{1}}, where A_{t} is the adjacency matrix of edge type t. The binarized value at (u,v) in A_{p} indicates whether u and v are connected with the meta-path p.In this paper, we use meta-path prediction as a self-supervised auxiliary task. Meta-Path [46, 49] is a path on a heterogeneous graph G that a sequence of nodes connected with heterogeneous edges, i.e., v1 t1 −→ v2 t2 −→ . . . tl −→ vl+1, where tl ∈ T e denotes an l-th edge type of the meta-path. The meta-path can be viewed as a composite relation R = t1 ◦ t2 . . . ◦ tl between node v1 and vl+1, where R1 ◦ R2 denotes the composition of relation R1 and R2. The definition of meta-path generalizes multi-hop connections and is shown to be useful to analyze heterogeneous graphs. For instance, in Book-Crossing dataset, ‘user-item-written.series-item-user’ indicates that a meta-path that connects users who like the same book series."

The task becomes even more difficult when mini-batch training is necessary due to the large size of datasets or models, as important nodes and edges for meta-paths may not be available within a mini-batch.","Meta-path prediction is generally more challenging than link prediction and node classification since it requires the understanding of long-range relations across heterogeneous nodes.

What is the role of meta-data in the proposed method?,"The choice of all-zero frame to denote the end of sequence is not arbitrary.

In the context of speech recognition, using an all-zero frame to indicate the end of an utterance is a common convention, as it allows the model to distinguish between the end of the utterance and the beginning of a new one.

The proposed formulation can suffer from the meta-overfitting antoniou2018train ; zintgraf2018fast  meaning that the parameters \Theta to learn weights for softly selecting meta-paths and balancing the tasks with the primary task can overfit to the small meta-dataset.In our experiment, we found that the overfitting can be alleviated by meta-validation sets antoniou2018train .To learn \Theta that is generalizable across meta-training sets, we optimize \Theta across k different meta-datasets like k-fold cross validation using the following equation:Θk+1=Θk−β𝔼[∇Θℒp⁢r(𝐰^k(Θk))],Dp⁢r⁢(m⁢e⁢t⁢a)∼CV\displaystyle\Theta^{k+1}\;=\;\underset{D^{pr(meta)}\sim CV\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;}{\Theta^{k}\;-\;\;\beta\;\;\mathbb{E}\left[\;\nabla_{\Theta}\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k}(\Theta^{k}))\;\right],}roman_Θ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k + 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = start_UNDERACCENT italic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r ( italic_m italic_e italic_t italic_a ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∼ italic_C italic_V end_UNDERACCENT start_ARG roman_Θ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_β blackboard_E [ ∇ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( over^ start_ARG bold_w end_ARG start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_Θ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) ) ] , end_ARG(9)where D^{pr(meta)}\sim CV is a meta-dataset from cross validation. We used 3-fold cross validation and the gradients of \Theta w.r.t different meta-datasets are averaged to update \Theta^{k}, see Algorithm 1. The cross validation is crucial to alleviate meta-overfitting and more discussion is Section 4.3. To circumvent the difficulty of the bi-level optimization, as previous works [39, 40] in meta-learning we approximate it with the updated parameters wˆ using the gradient descent update as w∗ (Θ) ≈ wˆ k (Θk ) = wk − α∇wL pr+au(wk ; Θk ), (6) where α is the learning rate for w. We do not numerically evaluate wˆ k (Θ) instead we plug the computational graph of wˆ k in L pr(w∗ (Θ)) to optimize Θ. Let ∇ΘL pr(w∗ (Θk )) be the gradient evaluated at Θk . Then updating parameters Θ is given as Θ k+1 = Θk − β∇ΘL pr(wˆ k (Θk )), (7) where β is the learning rate for Θ. This update allows softly selecting useful auxiliary tasks (metapaths) and balance them with the primary task to improve the performance of the primary task."
What is the anchor point in this paper?,Data acquisition and quality annotation are difficult and costly,"In this paper, the anchor points are a subset of a set of points (denoted as P) that are selected using the Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) algorithm. The anchor points are chosen by first selecting a random point and then sequentially choosing the farthest points from the previous points.","Sampling anchor points is the first step of our framework to locate multiple local transformations.To minimize the redundancy between local transformations, the anchor points \mathcal{P}^{\mathcal{A}}\subset\mathcal{P} are selected by the Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) algorithm.FPS randomly chooses the first point and then sequentially chooses the farthest points from previous points.This maximizes the coverage of anchor points and allows diverse transformations."
What does it mean the realistic sample?,"The examples of annotation holes are the hits found by dense retrieval systems like ANCE and TAS-B, which have not been judged by annotators","A realistic sample in this context refers to a 3D object that has undergone a smooth deformation, meaning that the shape of the object changes gradually rather than abruptly. The realistic samples that the authors aim to generate are those that resemble real-world objects with diverse shapes and deformations, such as airplanes with varying wing lengths and directions, guitars with different sizes and aspect ratios, and people with different heights and postures.","Smooth deformations are key to generate realistic and locally transformed samples.A naïve application of a random local transformation within its finite neighborhood may result in a discontinuous shape and an overlap of different parts. It has a high chance to lose discriminative structures.Instead, we employ the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression [27, 28] to smoothly interpolate the local transformations in the 3D space.Given M local transformations \{T_{j}\}_{j=1}^{M}, our smoothly varying transformation at an arbitrary point \mathbf{p}_{i} is given as:\small\hat{T}(\mathbf{p}_{i})=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{M}{K_{h}}(\mathbf{p}_{i},\mathbf{p}^{\mathcal{A}}_{j})T_{j}}{\sum_{k=1}^{M}{K_{h}}(\mathbf{p}_{i},\mathbf{p}^{\mathcal{A}}_{k})},(3)where K_{h}(\cdot,\cdot) is a kernel function with bandwidth h, and T_{j} is the local transformation in (2) centered at \mathbf{p}^{\mathcal{A}}_{j}.To define \hat{T}(\mathbf{p}_{i}) at any point in the 3D space, we use a kernel function that has a strictly positive value for any pair of points,i.e., K_{h}(\mathbf{p}_{i},\mathbf{p}_{j})>0 for \forall\mathbf{p}_{i},\forall\mathbf{p}_{j}.The following proposition theoretically guarantees that our augmentation is a smooth transformation under mild conditions. The proof is in the supplement. Thus, CDA is simply a similarity transformation with small jittering that cannot simulate diverse shapes and deformable objects.Unlike synthetic datasets like ModelNet [14] and ShapeNet [26], a real-world dataset like ScanObjectNN [1] further necessitates the generation of sophisticated deformations such as a mixture of local transformations.These are exemplified in Figure 1: airplanes with varying lengths and directions of wings and body, guitars in varying sizes and aspect ratios, and people with different heights and postures (e.g., crossing legs)."
Why should the proposed method have smoothly varying weights for transformations?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The complexity of the ShuffleNet model with a scale factor of 0.25 is approximately 35 MFLOPS (25 x 140 MFLOPS)","The proposed method uses smoothly varying weights for transformations to generate realistic and locally transformed samples. The reason for this is that a naive application of a random local transformation within its finite neighborhood can result in a discontinuous shape and an overlap of different parts, leading to loss of discriminative structures, which can make the augmented object unrealistic. By using smoothly varying weights, the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression is able to interpolate the local transformations in the 3D space smoothly, resulting in a more realistic and locally transformed sample.","Smooth deformations are key to generate realistic and locally transformed samples.A naïve application of a random local transformation within its finite neighborhood may result in a discontinuous shape and an overlap of different parts.

Why is it necessary to maximize the coverage of anchor points?,"The author suggests that the data used for pretraining has been under-emphasized because the performance improvements achieved by using more data (as shown in Table 4) were not fully captured in previous studies.

Evidence: Table 4 shows that the performance of the BERT model improves consistently as the amount of pretraining data increases, indicating that more data leads to better performance. However, the author notes that this relationship has not been fully explored in previous studies","Maximizing the coverage of anchor points is necessary in order to ensure that the local transformations are being applied evenly across the entire input space. This allows for a more diverse set of augmented samples to be generated, which can help to improve the robustness and generalization of a model trained on the augmented data.","We present a simple yet effective point cloud augmentation with weighted local transformations (PointWOLF).Our method generates deformation for point clouds by a convex combination of multiple transformations with smoothly varying weights.PointWOLF first selects several anchor points and locates random local transformations (e.g., similarity transformations) at the anchor points.Based on the distance from a point in the input to the anchor points, our method differentially applies the local transformations.The smoothly varying weights based on the distance to the anchor points allow spatially continuous augmentation and generate realistic samples.Our framework can be viewed as a kernel regression with transformations. Sampling anchor points is the first step of our framework to locate multiple local transformations.To minimize the redundancy between local transformations, the anchor points \mathcal{P}^{\mathcal{A}}\subset\mathcal{P} are selected by the Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) algorithm.FPS randomly chooses the first point and then sequentially chooses the farthest points from previous points.This maximizes the coverage of anchor points and allows diverse transformations."
What is the difficulty of augmentation on point clouds compared to augmentation on traditional 2d images?,"SISR has numerous applications in computer vision, including security and surveillance imaging, medical imaging, and other applications where high-resolution images are required","The difficulty of augmentation on point clouds compared to traditional 2D images is primarily due to the unordered and unstructured nature of point clouds. Unlike 2D images, which have a well-defined grid structure and pixels with fixed locations, point clouds are just a collection of points in 3D space. This makes it harder to apply standard image augmentation techniques, such as rotation and scaling, to point clouds. Additionally, point clouds often have missing or incomplete data, which can make it difficult to generate realistic augmentations.","Modern deep learning techniques, which established their popularity on structured data, began showing success on point clouds.Unlike images with clear lattice structures, each point cloud is an unordered set of points with no inherent structures that globally represent various 3D objects.Recent deep learning efforts have focused on enabling neural networks to operate on point clouds.While several point cloud datasets appeared, a particular dataset of scanned real-world objects [1] required a much greater understanding of the point cloud structures to identify highly complex real-world objects.In response, the approaches have evolved from extracting point-wise information with no structural information [2] to explicitly encoding the local structure [3].These works on network development have been making steady progress despite the scarcity of point cloud data."
What does non-linguistic means?,"Despite the challenges, clustering-based methods can still offer benefits for self-supervised learning, such as encouraging the learning of more robust and diverse representations by avoiding the collapse of all samples into a single cluster","Non-linguistic is something which is not related to linguistic information, and it includes the tasks such as quantitative computation and decimal operation.","In this paper, we explore whether pretraining on text is inherently about learning language, or if pretraining also imbues LMs with skills for symbolic manipulation and non-linguistic reasoning (for example, performing quantitative computation such as finding the median of a set of numbers, recognizing regular expressions, or identifying whether a string is a palindrome, as shown in Figure 1). In other words, we investigate whether and how pretraining develops helpful inductive biases for non-linguistic reasoning. For this analysis, we create a set of 19 tasks from three categories of task paradigms: quantitative computation (§3.1), recognizing regular expressions (§3.2), and string reasoning (§3.3). Figure 1 shows an example for each category, and the full list of tasks is described in the table 1. We experiment with transformer and RNN based LMs (§4) for learning these tasks, and perform a comparative analysis with (non-pretrained) neural model variants from the perspective of learning metrics such as accuracy and sample efficiency. Tables 2 and 3 shows the average accuracy of six non-linguistic tasks (palindrome classification, isogram classification, tautonym classification, odd even classification, decimal operation and median) fine-tuned using different BERT and DeBERTA representations respectively. We note that the models pretrained on all three domains outperformed the non-pretrained model (NP). This suggests that the results of experiments in Section 5 generalize to new text corpora for pretraining, and do not rely on having access to text on specific topics during pretraining. This is a non-trivial result, since it suggests for example, that the higher performance of pretrained models on tasks such as palindrome and anagram classification is not due to the pretrained models having seen information about such concepts during pretraining. This is especially so since the results even generalize to ROC stories, which contain no information on such technical concepts. "
"Is this true? Despite using three different pretraining data (text domain), the model shows similar accuracy in big sample case.","The authors' work is different from the “fast gradient sign” method in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The authors propose a method called DeepFool, which computes adversarial perturbations more accurately and efficiently than the “fast gradient sign” method. DeepFool uses a different approach that is based on the concept of the minimal perturbation, whereas the “fast gradient sign” method uses a single gradient step to compute the adversarial perturbations. As a result, DeepFool provides a more reliable and efficient way to compute adversarial perturbations, which can be used to assess the robustness of classifiers and to build more robust classifiers",It's false. Models which pretrained using three different data outperform all non-pretrained data.,"Tables 2 and 3 shows the average accuracy of six non-linguistic tasks (palindrome classification, isogram classification, tautonym classification, odd even classification, decimal operation and median) fine-tuned using different BERT and DeBERTA representations respectively.

This is especially so since the results even generalize to ROC stories, which contain no information on such technical concepts.  In Table 2, we note that all three non-English pretrained LMs significantly outperformed non-pretrained models, with the best performance being comparable or marginally lower than English versions. In fact, Code-BERT surprisingly surpasses ROC by 5%. These findings strongly indicate that the advantages from pretraining have little to do with the format of the tasks, since they persist for scenarios with little shared linguistic structure. "
Does codeBERT trained by natural language?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The images for each category in the ILSVRC challenge are collected directly from ImageNet","No, CodeBERT trained by code from six programming language.","A possible rationale for explaining the beneficial effect of pretraining for non-linguistic tasks is that irrespective of whether the tasks require non-linguistic reasoning, their format is in language, and hence language models should be able to learn these tasks with fewer examples. To test this hypothesis, we also experiment with models pretrained on text from languages different from English, as well as models pretrained on computer code. These include the following models: Multilingual BERT.Multilingual BERT is pretrained on text from 102 different languages. About 21% of the pretraining text is English.Chinese BERT.Chinese BERT is a BERT model pretrained on Chinese text. Code BERT.CodeBERT Feng et al. (2020) is pretrained on code from six programming languages."
Does DeBERTa has a larger representations dimensions than BERT large?,"The authors use a loss function that contains two terms for content and style, respectively, which are well separated, allowing them to smoothly regulate the emphasis on either reconstructing the content or the style","No, because dimension of BERT-large is 1024, and DeBERTa is 768.","Next, we describe the LMs and their variants used in NILM. We experiment with four language models, based on both Transformer and RNN architectures.

"According to the paper, does BERT is overfitted?",Yes,They say that the reason of good performance of fine-tuned model is not caused by task specific knowledge.,"Tables 2 and 3 shows the average accuracy of six non-linguistic tasks (palindrome classification, isogram classification, tautonym classification, odd even classification, decimal operation and median) fine-tuned using different BERT and DeBERTA representations respectively.

Is this true?: Calculating length of a string is string reasoning task.,"GPT-Critic is free from the issue of diverging from human language because it learns from the self-generated human-like responses, which are guided by the critic",Calculating length of a string is not a string reasoning task because it does not require character composition within or with another string.,"This task paradigm focuses on reasoning tasks over individual strings or pairs of strings. Palindrome classification.A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward. The task is to classify whether a given string is a palindrome. The string length ranges from 1 to 15.Anagram classification.Two strings are anagrams if one is formed by rearranging letters from the other. The task is to classify if a pair of strings are anagrams. The string length ranges from 2 to 15.Isogram classification.A string is an isogram if it has no repeating characters. The task is to classify whether a given string is an isogram. The string length ranges from 1 to 52.Tautonym classification.A tautonym is a word which can be broken down into two identical parts, with the same spelling. The task is to classify whether a given string is a tautonym. The string length ranges from 1 to 10. Length of a string.Output the length of a given string. The string length ranges from 1 to 10.Count of unique characters.Given a string, count the number of unique characters in it. The string lengths ranges from 10 to 30.Parity check.Given a binary string, output if the counts of ones and zeros are the same. The maximum length of the binary string is 20.Vowels classification.Given a string, classify if the string contains only vowel characters. The string length ranges from 3 to 10. Maximum frequent character.Given a string, output the character with the maximum frequency. The string length ranges from 5 to 30. String reasoning: Figures 6 show the results on Palindrome, Anagram, Isogram and Tautonym classification. These tasks require character comparison within the string or with another string. Again, the pretrained variants consistently outperformed non-pretrained models variants in all of these tasks. In particular, the non-pretrained models completely fail to learn the Anagram and Palindrome tasks even for the largest training set size. Again, Transformer based LMs outperform LSTM based LMs."
Is this true? NILM has only classification tasks.,"Sure! Based on the context you provided, the answer is:

The value of the λ scale is 10","It's true, becase NILM has three kinds of tasks, and all tasks it classification task.","In this section, we describe the tasks used for our analysis, which we refer to as NILM (measuring Non-linguistic Inductive bias in Language Models).

How is SNLI sort and SNLI shuffle different?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

NO.

STHarm generates chords that are not necessarily common or frequent in real-world music, despite having high H scores.

How Zipf distribution and Uniform distribution different?,"ORB-SLAM (short) performs poorly when the turning magnitude is low because it relies on local feature matching, which is less effective when the car is driving straight and there are few distinct features to match","Zipf distribution consists of words which picked with a unigram probability that follows Zipf's law. However, uniform distribution consists of words that sampled with a uniform unigram probability.","Zipf distribution. We select 30k words (types) from the Amazon reviews dataset. Words are picked with a unigram probability that follows Zipf’s word frequency law, which all natural languages empirically follow Piantadosi (2014). For the Zipf distribution, we chose \alpha=1 and \beta=2.7, to match the parameters of most natural languages. The text does not follow any word order.Uniform distribution. In this dataset, words are sampled from the same vocabulary as in ‘Zipf distribution’, but with a uniform unigram probability. The text does not follow any word order.Synthetic Vocabulary. Words are selected with uniform distribution from a vocabulary to form sentences.

What does NILM means? Is it different to GLUE?,"To provide complimentary information. The author added both query-to-context and context-to-query attention mechanisms to capture both the contextual information and the query-specific information, leading to better performance",NILM is the dataset of measuring Non-linguistic Inductive bias in Language Models. It is different with GLUE since GLUE focus on tasks require linguistic knowledge and reasoning.,"Pretrained Language Models (LMs) have shown singular succcess on a range of natural language understandings tasks, to the extent that they have become foundational for contemporary NLP systems. Several works have investigated why pretraining works so well Warstadt et al. (2019); Zhao et al. (2020). In particular, studies have shown that the pretrained LMs like BERT capture linguistic knowledge about syntax Lin et al. (2019); Wu et al. (2020), semantics Vulić et al. (2020b, a) and morphology Hofmann et al. (2020, 2021). In fact, Tenney et al. (2019) demonstrated that learned representations in pretrained LMs even internally reflect the classical NLP pipeline. Since most NLP benchmarks such as SuperGLUE Wang et al. (2019) naturally are focused on tasks such as textual entailment and reading comprehension that require linguistic knowledge and reasoning, it is unsurprising that LMs have achieved strong results on these tasks. On the other hand, little work so far has explored the abilities of pretrained LMs for learning non-linguistic tasks.  In this section, we describe the tasks used for our analysis, which we refer to as NILM (measuring Non-linguistic Inductive bias in Language Models).

We selected 500k movies and tv reviews from the larger Amazon reviews dataset He and McAuley (2016) and used for pretraining.

What is the objective of this section?,"No, the authors do not use any datasets other than TIMIT to gauge the generalizability of their model","They did Non-english and computer languages test to shows that the benefits of from pretraining have little to do with the format of the tasks. Therefore, objective of this section is to show that advantage of pretraining persist with various degrees.","Finally, we investigate the role that pretraining data plays in influencing task performance on non-linguistic tasks (§7). We experiment with pretraining on different domains of text, pretraining on perturbed representations of natural language text (such as shuffled word order), pretraining on text of computer programs (no linguistic properties of natural languages), pretraining on multi-lingual and non-English text, and pretraining with synthetic text (data sampled from synthetic distributions). Our analysis reveals that the advantages of pretraining surprisingly persist with various degrees across these variations, suggesting hithertho unexplored connections between pretraining and the learning abilities of language models. Our contributions are: In Table 2, we note that all three non-English pretrained LMs significantly outperformed non-pretrained models, with the best performance being comparable or marginally lower than English versions. In fact, Code-BERT surprisingly surpasses ROC by 5%. These findings strongly indicate that the advantages from pretraining have little to do with the format of the tasks, since they persist for scenarios with little shared linguistic structure. "
what is the evidence for auther’s saying: “Our observation that is behavior is seen even when pretraining on synthetically generated languages”?,"Focusing on latency-aware NAS is important because it can find a larger network with shorter latency by directly adding the latency factor to the loss function, and the number of MAC operations is not a proper measure of latency",Author said  “Our observation that is behavior is seen even when pretraining on synthetically generated languages” since they showed that the benefits of pretraining persist with various degrees in non-linguistic tasks.,"Finally, we investigate the role that pretraining data plays in influencing task performance on non-linguistic tasks (§7).

"Look Figure 4.  Give your one observation by comparing (a) and (b), or pretrained and non-pretrained. Reason them.",Yes,"pretrained LMs can perfectly learn the tasks with many fewer labeled examples, compared to the non-pretrained models in both tasks.","Recognizing regular expressions: Figure 4 shows the comparative performance of pretrained LMs on non-pretrained models on the two tasks involving recognizing regular expressions. For both tasks, we note that the pretrained LMs can perfectly learn the tasks with many fewer labeled examples compared to the non-pretrained models.

What are the examples of offline RL algorithms that are not straightforwardly applicable to the task-oriented dialogue domain?,"Controlling the variance of the encoder distribution q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) allows for a more precise control over the level of overlap between the encoded datapoints, as increasing the variance increases the range of possible encodings and can lead to a better match between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right)",Most of the algorithms based on the policy gradient such as actor-critic are not straightforwardly applicable to the task-oriented dialogue domain,"Training a task-oriented conversational agent from a dialogue corpus can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine reinforcement learning (RL) problem (Levine et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020), which offers the prospect to optimize the policy solely from the ﬁxed dataset without online environment interaction. Most of the existing ofﬂine RL methods are built on the off-policy Actor- Critic framework, which performs iterative optimization of the policy (i.e. actor) and the action- value function (i.e. critic) (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Janner et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020). Yet, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods generally results in poor dialogue strategies which generate responses in no way similar to human language (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). Ofﬂine Reinforcement Learning. There have been extensive studies on ofﬂine RL (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Levine et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Most of prior works are built on the off-policy actor-critic framework, and they focus on the overestimation issue by taking the OOD actions (Kumar et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020). However, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods suffer from the issue of diverging from human language in the task-oriented dialogues (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). On the other hand, there are a number of recent works on weighted behavior cloning, where a policy is trained by a variant of supervised learning loss (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). The weighted behavior cloning approaches ﬁlter out bad actions, then perform behavior cloning on high-quality data.

How does the author show that the algorithm is free from the issue of diverging from human-language?,"Yes.

Conditional computation, as described in the context, can be seen as a form of chain rule for independent variables, where the computation of each hidden state is conditioned on the previous hidden state and the input for that position. This allows the model to factorize the computation and improve efficiency, similar to how the chain rule can be used to decompose complex computations into simpler ones",The authors show it by conducting the human evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).,"We also conduct human evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess the quality of gen- erated responses of GPT-Critic and baseline algorithms, using the evaluation protocol as in (Yang et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Speciﬁcally, human workers on AMT were asked to read the context and generated response by interactive simulation via ConvLab, then score the following two evaluation metrics on a Likert scale (1-5): 1) Appropriateness : evaluates whether the generated responses are appropriate for the given context, 2) Fluency : evaluates whether the gen- erated responses are comprehensible and human-like. We compare the performance of GPT-Critic with same baselines on ConvLab evaluation. Figure 3 summarizes the overall results of human eval- uation, where 60 workers evaluate the quality of 30 randomly selected dialogues for each algorithm.

What are the metrics used to evaluate the performance in terms of task success?,VERY IMPORTANT,"This work evaluates the performance in terms of task success by using following metrics: 1) In- form : evaluates whether the system provides an appropriate entity, 2) Success : evaluates whether the system answers all the requested information, 3) Book: evaluates how many booked entities satisfy the user constraints, 4) Inform (Precision / Recall / F1): evaluates how many user requests have been informed.","We evaluate our algorithm on the MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset, which is one of the representative task- oriented dialogue benchmarks. The MultiWOZ 2.0 is a large-scale multi-domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset, where a tourist (i.e. user) converses with a clerk (i.e. system) at the information center in a touristic city. It consists of 8438/1000/1000 dialogues for training/validation/testing. For end-to-end evaluation on the MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset, we use the following automatic evaluation metrics: 1) In- form : evaluates whether the system provides an appropriate entity, 2) Success : evaluates whether the system answers all the requested information, 3) BLEU : measures the ﬂuency of the generated response (Papineni et al., 2002). We also report the Combined Score as an overall quality measure In order to evaluate the performance of dialogue agents in an end-to-end fashion, we conduct simulator-based evaluation on ConvLab (Zhu et al., 2020). ConvLab is an open-source toolkit that enables to build task-oriented dialogue systems and perform an end-to-end evaluation. The simulator-based evaluation is more reliable than dataset-based automatic evaluation because it eval- uates the performance while interacting with the user simulator. To interact with dialogue systems, ConvLab provides an agenda-based user simulator (Schatzmann et al., 2007) that consists of a BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) for NLU, a rule-based policy, and a template-based NLG. We compare the per- formance of GPT-Critic with baseline algorithms interacting with the same user simulator and user goals. We report the results with the following metrics: 1) Complete : evaluates whether the sys- tem completes the goal, 2) Success : evaluates whether all the user requests have been informed and the booked entities satisfy the constraints, 3) Book : evaluates how many booked entities satisfy the We also conduct human evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess the quality of gen- erated responses of GPT-Critic and baseline algorithms, using the evaluation protocol as in (Yang et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).

Did the authors have an experiment with training the state-of-the-art offline RL algorithm with MultiWOZ dataset?,"The graph of the average IOU vs. number of clusters suggests that k = 5 is the optimal choice for the complexity/recall tradeoff because it has a similar performance to 9 anchor boxes (61.0) with a much simpler model (5 centroids) compared to using 9 centroids, which results in a higher average IOU (64.3)",The authors provide experimental results of CRR and Decision Transformer as baselines of offline RL algorithm.,"In this section, we show the experimental results of GPT-critic on both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. First, we evaluate the performances of GPT-Critic on the MultiWOZ 2.0 (Budzianowski et al., 2018) as dataset-based automatic evaluation, compared with baseline methods including ofﬂine RL algorithms. Second, for more realistic evaluation, we conduct a simulator-based evaluation on the ConvLab framework (Zhu et al., 2020). Third, we also conduct the human eval- uation to evaluate the quality of generated responses. Finally, we give a qualitative analysis of our method using generated dialogue examples on the training dataset of MultiWOZ 2.0, which shows how GPT-Critic improves the performance through the behavior cloning of self-generated dialogues. The qualitative analysis with generated dialogue examples can be found in Appendix B. In addition, we also compare with recent ofﬂine RL algorithms that are free from the issue of di- verging from human language: 1) CRR (Wang et al., 2020), a value-ﬁltered regression method that performs weighted behavior cloning of ofﬂine dataset, 2) Decision Transformer (Chen et al., 2021), a Transformer-based architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. For a fair comparison, we use the same pre-trained GPT-2 model as a policy network to train the CRR and the Decision Transformer. Moreover, to show that the policy-gradient-based standard RL algorithms suffer from diverging from human language, we also provide examples of responses generated by policy-gradient-based standard RL algorithm in Appendix D. For the results of ofﬂine RL baselines, CRR and Decision Transformer show the results that do not diverge from human-language, since their policy is also trained by behavior cloning. However, both algorithms show limited performance because they perform behavior cloning on a ﬁxed dataset. CRR has achieved remarkable success in continuous control tasks by performing weighted behavior cloning of training dataset ﬁltered by critic, but it does not effectively perform in the task-oriented dialogues because of data scarcity. Furthermore, to evaluate the Decision Transformer, we adopt a delayed return where the agent receives the cumulative reward at the end of dialogue, since the agent cannot observe user goal. Therefore, without observing the user goal at test time, Decision Transformer reduces to the behavior cloning of successful dialogues."
CRR is also an algorithm that is free from issues that diverge from human language. What are the advantages compared to CRR?,Yes,"CRR is a variant of weighted behavior cloning approaches that perform behavior cloning with a learned weight on a fixed dataset.

They claim that the proposed algorithm can maintain the GPT-2’s ability to generate human-like responses while improving the task performance. Is this true?,"These initial results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for text-conditioned video generation, achieving high perceptual quality scores and outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The results also show the benefit of using classifier-free guidance and joint video-image training, as well as the improvement of the proposed reconstruction guidance method over the replacement method for conditional sampling","The authors claim that the proposed algorithm can maintain the GPT-2’s ability to generate human-like responses while improving the task performance. In the experiments, they show that the proposed method improves the task performance without the issue of diverging from human language.","Table 3 summarizes the overall performance of GPT-Critic and baseline algorithms in end-to-end response generation setting, where the generated dialogue state and generated dialogue act are used for the DB search and response generation. The results show that GPT-Critic achieved the best performance in terms of inform rate, success rate, and combined score. Moreover, the performance of GPT-Critic on the BLEU score matches those of other pre-trained LM-based methods, since GPT-Critic inherits GPT-2’s ability to generate human-like responses through the behavior cloning of responses generated by GPT-2. The results show that GPT-Critic improves the task performance of the agent without the issue of diverging from human language.

Which of the baseline algorithms are the offline RL algorithms?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The proposed autoencoder architecture prevents overfitting or identity mapping through two factors:

1. Limited number of hidden units, which makes it unlikely for the model to learn trivial mappings for arbitrary length input sequences.
2. Recursive application of the same LSTM operation to decode the representation, which prevents the model from learning an identity mapping",CRR and Decision Transformer are used as offline RL baseline algorithms in the paper.,"In addition, we also compare with recent ofﬂine RL algorithms that are free from the issue of di- verging from human language: 1) CRR (Wang et al., 2020), a value-ﬁltered regression method that performs weighted behavior cloning of ofﬂine dataset, 2) Decision Transformer (Chen et al., 2021), a Transformer-based architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling.

Therefore, without observing the user goal at test time, Decision Transformer reduces to the behavior cloning of successful dialogues."
How are actions defined in task-oriented dialogue?,,"In task-oriented dialogues, the actions are defined as a sequence of tokens which represents dialogue act and system response.","We consider the task-oriented dialogue system that can be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) (Williams & Young, 2007) deﬁned by tuple (cid:104) S, A, O, T, Z, R, γ (cid:105) where S is the set of environment states s = (cid:104) g, h (cid:105) (underlying state that consists of the user goal g and dialogue history h ), A is the set of actions a (a sequence of tokens which represents dialogue act and system response ), O is the set of observations o (user utterance), T ( s (cid:48) | s, a ) = Pr( s t +1 = s (cid:48) | s t = s, a t = a ) is the transition function, Z ( o | s (cid:48) , a ) = Pr( o t +1 = o | s t +1 = s (cid:48) , a t = a ) is the observation probability, R ( g, h, a ) is the reward function indicating the utility of executing action a in history h and the user goal g , and γ ∈ (0 , 1) is a discount factor. The history at time step t , h t = { o 0 , a 0 , . . . o t − 1 , a t − 1 , o t } , is a sequence of all previous observations and actions. Since the underlying state s (e.g. user goal) is not directly observable, the agent makes decisions based on the entire observation-action history. The policy π ( a t | h t ) is mapping from history h t to a probability distribution over A . The goal is to ﬁnd an optimal policy π ∗ that maximizes the expected cumulative rewards, i.e. π ∗ = arg max π E π [ (cid:80) ∞ t =0 γ t R ( g, h t , a t )] . The action-value function of policy π is deﬁned as Q π ( h, a ) := E π [ (cid:80) ∞ t =0 γ t R ( g, h t , a t ) | h 0 = h, a 0 = a ] , where Q π is a unique solution of the Bellman equation: Q π ( h, a ) = E g [ R ( g, h, a )] + γ E π [ Q π ( h (cid:48) , a (cid:48) )] ."
What does “KL control” means?,YOLOv3 calculates the coordinates of the predicted box from the anchor box and output coordinates by transforming the output coordinates using the anchor box's transformation matrix,KL control means that the regularization technique to restrict the policy to stay close to its prior policy.,"Reinforcement Learning for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems. Applying the standard RL meth- ods straightforwardly to optimize a task-oriented dialogue agent causes the issue of diverging from human language. To address this problem, interleaving reinforcement learning with supervised learning has been proposed but it is still not free from the issue of diverging from human language (Lewis et al., 2017). Recently, the latent representation models for language actions have been in- troduced to address the aforementioned problem (Zhao et al., 2019; Yarats & Lewis, 2018). They disentangle the semantics of the utterance and the natural language generation, and then perform goal-based training in the space of the latent variables instead of directly optimizing utterances. However, they cannot be directly applied to large-scale pre-trained language models that are not designed in a way that works inherently with discrete latent variables. Jaques et al. (2020) use KL- control to restrict the policy to stay close to its prior policy, but it still suffers from divergence from human language even with carefully chosen hyper-parameters. Furthermore, Jang et al. (2020) adopt Bayes-adaptive Monte-Carlo planning to negotiation dialogue then use it as a policy improvement operator. This approach can prevent the issue of diverging from human language through the policy improvement based on behavior cloning of self-generated dialogues. However, they assume a user model that is difﬁcult enough to be considered another problem."
What does “offline RL” means?,"Phones refer to individual speech sounds or phoneemes in the TIMIT corpus, which is a dataset of speech recordings",Offline RL is one of the reinforcement learning settings that assumes the agent aims to optimize the policy solely from the ﬁxed dataset without online environment interaction.,"Training a task-oriented dialogue agent can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine rein- forcement learning (RL) problem, where the agent aims to learn a conversational strategy to achieve user goals, only from a dialogue corpus. It is very challenging in terms of RL since the natural language action space is astronomical, while feasi- ble (syntactically and semantically correct) actions are very sparse. Thus, standard RL methods easily fail and generate responses diverging from human language, even when ﬁne-tuning a powerful pre-trained language model. In this paper, we introduce GPT-Critic, an ofﬂine RL method for task-oriented dialogue. GPT-Critic is built upon GPT-2, ﬁne-tuning the language model through behavior cloning of the critic-guided self-generated sentences. GPT-Critic is essentially free from the issue of diverging from human language since it learns from the sentences sam- pled from the pre-trained language model. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in the task-oriented dialogue benchmarks including MultiWOZ 2.0 and ConvLab. Training a task-oriented conversational agent from a dialogue corpus can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine reinforcement learning (RL) problem (Levine et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020), which offers the prospect to optimize the policy solely from the ﬁxed dataset without online environment interaction.

What is “overestimation issue” in RL?,"When dealing with mentions that lack correct entities in their candidate lists, the Global model is necessary to link these mentions by leveraging correct candidates from other mentions in the cluster",The overestimation issue means the problem when the action values are overestimated by using out-of-distribution actions in RL.,"where ¯ φ is the parameters of the target network. As discussed in the prior work (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020), optimizing this loss can be challenging in the ofﬂine RL setting due to the overestimation issue in the bootstrapping process by taking out-of-distribution (OOD) actions to evaluate the value of the next state.

CRR has achieved remarkable success in continuous control tasks by performing weighted behavior cloning of training dataset ﬁltered by critic, but it does not effectively perform in the task-oriented dialogues because of data scarcity. Furthermore, to evaluate the Decision Transformer, we adopt a delayed return where the agent receives the cumulative reward at the end of dialogue, since the agent cannot observe user goal. Therefore, without observing the user goal at test time, Decision Transformer reduces to the behavior cloning of successful dialogues."
How is learning a task-oriented dialogue agent different from the problems in the RL domain?,CRR and Decision Transformer are the offline RL algorithms,"In task-oriented dialogue, the action space is combinatorially large and a naive application of RL algorithms suffer from the issue of diverging from human language.","Training a task-oriented dialogue agent can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine rein- forcement learning (RL) problem, where the agent aims to learn a conversational strategy to achieve user goals, only from a dialogue corpus. It is very challenging in terms of RL since the natural language action space is astronomical, while feasi- ble (syntactically and semantically correct) actions are very sparse. Thus, standard RL methods easily fail and generate responses diverging from human language, even when ﬁne-tuning a powerful pre-trained language model. In this paper, we introduce GPT-Critic, an ofﬂine RL method for task-oriented dialogue. GPT-Critic is built upon GPT-2, ﬁne-tuning the language model through behavior cloning of the critic-guided self-generated sentences. GPT-Critic is essentially free from the issue of diverging from human language since it learns from the sentences sam- pled from the pre-trained language model. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in the task-oriented dialogue benchmarks including MultiWOZ 2.0 and ConvLab. Building an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue agent is one of the promising applications of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet challenging due to large language action spaces and limited availability of human-annotated data. Recently, large-scale pre-trained language models (LM) have achieved remarkable successes in various NLP tasks with prohibitively large vocabulary (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2019). The current best performing end-to-end conversational agents for a task-oriented dialogue system utilize a pre-training on large- scale corpus and ﬁne-tuning on downstream tasks (Ham et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021). This combination of pre-training and ﬁne-tuning signiﬁcantly improves overall performance in the task-oriented dialogues. However, supervised ﬁne-tuning (i.e. imitation learning of the dialogue corpus) alone may not be sufﬁcient to learn an optimal dialogue strategy since the corpus often contains suboptimal dialogues collected from human participants of diverse expertise levels. Thus, in order to optimize the task performance of the conversational agent, goal- oriented training (i.e. reinforcement learning) is an essential and promising direction to pursue. Training a task-oriented conversational agent from a dialogue corpus can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine reinforcement learning (RL) problem (Levine et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020), which offers the prospect to optimize the policy solely from the ﬁxed dataset without online environment interaction. Most of the existing ofﬂine RL methods are built on the off-policy Actor- Critic framework, which performs iterative optimization of the policy (i.e. actor) and the action- value function (i.e. critic) (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Janner et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020). Yet, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods generally results in poor dialogue strategies which generate responses in no way similar to human language (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). Reinforcement Learning for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems. Applying the standard RL meth- ods straightforwardly to optimize a task-oriented dialogue agent causes the issue of diverging from human language. To address this problem, interleaving reinforcement learning with supervised learning has been proposed but it is still not free from the issue of diverging from human language (Lewis et al., 2017). Recently, the latent representation models for language actions have been in- troduced to address the aforementioned problem (Zhao et al., 2019; Yarats & Lewis, 2018). They disentangle the semantics of the utterance and the natural language generation, and then perform goal-based training in the space of the latent variables instead of directly optimizing utterances. However, they cannot be directly applied to large-scale pre-trained language models that are not designed in a way that works inherently with discrete latent variables. Jaques et al. (2020) use KL- control to restrict the policy to stay close to its prior policy, but it still suffers from divergence from human language even with carefully chosen hyper-parameters. Furthermore, Jang et al. (2020) adopt Bayes-adaptive Monte-Carlo planning to negotiation dialogue then use it as a policy improvement operator. This approach can prevent the issue of diverging from human language through the policy improvement based on behavior cloning of self-generated dialogues. However, they assume a user model that is difﬁcult enough to be considered another problem."
What is main different between the experiments on MultiWOZ and ConvLab?,True,The main difference is that MultiWOZ banchmark provides dataset-based automatic evaluation and ConvLab framework provides a simulator-based evaluation.,"In this section, we show the experimental results of GPT-critic on both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. First, we evaluate the performances of GPT-Critic on the MultiWOZ 2.0 (Budzianowski et al., 2018) as dataset-based automatic evaluation, compared with baseline methods including ofﬂine RL algorithms. Second, for more realistic evaluation, we conduct a simulator-based evaluation on the ConvLab framework (Zhu et al., 2020). Third, we also conduct the human eval- uation to evaluate the quality of generated responses.

SAT models consistently outperform SOTA methods on various datasets, demonstrating their ability to combine the benefits of GNNs and Transformers, and providing better interpretability than Transformers","Since a naive application of existing offline RL algorithms suffer from the issue of diverging from human language, it is not straightforward to apply them to the task-oriented dialogue.","Training a task-oriented conversational agent from a dialogue corpus can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine reinforcement learning (RL) problem (Levine et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020), which offers the prospect to optimize the policy solely from the ﬁxed dataset without online environment interaction.

There have been extensive studies on ofﬂine RL (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Levine et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Most of prior works are built on the off-policy actor-critic framework, and they focus on the overestimation issue by taking the OOD actions (Kumar et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020). However, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods suffer from the issue of diverging from human language in the task-oriented dialogues (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). On the other hand, there are a number of recent works on weighted behavior cloning, where a policy is trained by a variant of supervised learning loss (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). The weighted behavior cloning approaches ﬁlter out bad actions, then perform behavior cloning on high-quality data. However, in the task-oriented dialogues, simply dropping the unsuccessful dialogues from the corpus is undesirable, since they may contain some task-speciﬁc information that is useful to properly respond to user requests. Our GPT-Critic aims to revise unsuccessful dialogues into successful ones, which is in contrast to the weighted behavior cloning on the ﬁxed training dataset, where the action choice is restricted to the support in the dataset (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). More recently, Chen et al. (2021) introduce Decision Transformer, a Transformer-based architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. These ofﬂine RL methods based on behavior cloning are directly applied to the task-oriented dialogues without aforementioned issue, but their results are similar to that of behavior cloning in the task-oriented dialogues."

We also conduct human evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess the quality of gen- erated responses of GPT-Critic and baseline algorithms, using the evaluation protocol as in (Yang et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Speciﬁcally, human workers on AMT were asked to read the context and generated response by interactive simulation via ConvLab, then score the following two evaluation metrics on a Likert scale (1-5): 1) Appropriateness : evaluates whether the generated responses are appropriate for the given context, 2) Fluency : evaluates whether the gen- erated responses are comprehensible and human-like. We compare the performance of GPT-Critic with same baselines on ConvLab evaluation. Figure 3 summarizes the overall results of human eval- uation, where 60 workers evaluate the quality of 30 randomly selected dialogues for each algorithm. The results show that GPT-Critic signiﬁcantly outperforms baseline algorithms in appropriateness which is related to task accomplishment. Moreover, the result of ﬂuency shows that GPT-Critic does not hurt the agent’s capability to generate human-like sentences."
What is different between the results denoted by planning and learning in Table 2.,"The ""verb-noun structure"" refers to the combination of a verb and its direct noun object in a sentence, and the analysis of this structure in the generated instructions shows the diversity of intents and textual formats in the dataset","The results denoted by planning report the performance of planning through the simulation, and the results denoted by learning report the performance without further simulation.","In order to understand the effectiveness of MC-LAVE as a policy improvement operator, we compare the performances of PUCT-RL and MC-LAVE-RL in Z ORK 1. Table 2 reports the intermediate results of planning and supervised learning in each iteration of the policy iteration. In each iteration, the policy and the Q-function are trained using planning trajectories and experience replay collected from 25 independent planning agents. As can be seen in Table 2, the performance of MC-LAVE-RL is improved more consistently than PUCT-RL, both in planning and learning. At the beginning of the policy iteration, PUCT-RL improves the performance, but it fails to overcome bottleneck and converges to a suboptimal policy: PUCT utilizes the prior policy learned by imitating the planning results of the previous iteration to estimate the exploration bonus, but this uncertainty-based method is not much effective to encourage the agent to explore the action space that is not sufﬁciently covered. On the other hand, MC-LAVE-RL not only uses the prior policy, but also uses Q-Network for credit assignment to language actions. This allows a more focused exploration on semantically promising actions and consequently overcomes the bottleneck to further improve the performance."
Did the authors have an experiment with training the state-of-the-art RL algorithm on the Jericho envrionment?,"The conditional decoder is difficult to optimize because it relies heavily on short-range correlations in the input data, which can result in a limited gradient signal and make it challenging for the model to learn long-term dependencies",The authors compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art RL algorithm MC!Q*BERT on Jericho environment.,"First, we compare the performance of MC-LAVE-RL with the following algorithms: (1) DRRN (Hausknecht et al., 2020), a variant of the DQN algorithm (Mnih et al., 2013) for natural lan- guage action space, (2) TDQN (Hausknecht et al., 2020), an extension of LSTM-DQN algorithm (Narasimhan et al., 2015) incorporating with template-based action generation, (3) KG-A2C (Am- manabrolu & Hausknecht, 2020), an actor-critic method with knowledge graph state representation, (4) MC!Q*BERT (Ammanabrolu et al., 2020), an extension of KG-A2C with BERT-based knowl- edge graph construction and knowledge-graph-based intrinsic reward.

Although MC-LAVE-RL requires more handicap or assumption, it performs the same or better than strong baseline MC!Q*BERT which requires similar assumptions and more requirements. In addition, MC-LAVE-RL achieves higher game scores on overall games compared to PUCT-RL, which is a baseline algorithm that only excludes language-driven exploration strategy from MC-LAVE-RL. Furthermore, MC-LAVE-RL performs signiﬁcantly better than other methods on difﬁcult games such as Z ORK 1, D EEPHOME , and L UDICORP , which are categorized by Hausknecht et al.

We use a batch size of 4096 and employ the LARS optimizer [52] with a weight decay of 10−6. We use linearly scaled learning rate of lr × batch size/256 [27] with a base learning rate of 0.3. 5 We adjust the learning rate with 10 epochs of a linear warmup followed by cosine scheduling. We also use an exponential moving average (EMA) network by default."
[Section 4.2]: What characteristics do the aforementioned datasets in transfer learning have? ,"The dataset would be vulnerable to degenerate solutions and biased towards individuals with prior knowledge of the entities present in the text.

How does the proposed method address the issue of cluster collapse?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The performance of the R-CNN model would likely decrease if the authors replaced the three prediction layers with DPM (Deformable Convolution Layers)",Mutual information regularizer unfavors collapsed representation.,"The MI term in Eq. 4 takes a minimum value when collapsing happens.MIRA naturally avoids collapsed solution via penalizing assignment that exhibits low MI.Specifically, unless starting from the collapsed state, MIRA finds MI-maximizing points around the model prediction; it will not choose collapsed pseudo-labels.Hence, the iterative training to predict such labels will not collapse whenever the prediction of pseudo-labels is achievable.Our empirical results verify that MIRA does not require extra training techniques or artificial constraints to address collapsing."
How does the cluster-based method learn meaningful representation from scratch?,"Individual work performance (IWP) consists of three components:

1. Task performance: Proficiency in performing core substantive or technical tasks central to the job.
2. Contextual performance: Behaviors that support the organizational, social, and psychological environment in which the technical core must function.
3. Counterproductive work behavior: Behaviors that harm the well-being of the organization","Clustering methods encourage the representations to encode the semantic structures of the data. While this can be prone to collapse, they rely on extra techniques.","Meanwhile, a line of work uses clustering for un-/self-supervised representation learning.They explicitly assign pseudo-labels to embedded representation via clustering, and the model is thereby trained to predict such labels.These clustering-based methods can account for inter-data similarity; representations are encouraged to encode the semantic structure of data.Prior works Yang et al. (2016); Xie et al. (2016); Bautista et al. (2016); Hu et al. (2017) have shown encouraging results in small-scaled settings; Caron et al.

Despite its conceptual simplicity, a naive application of clustering to representation learning is hard to achieve, especially when training with large-scale datasets.This is because clustering-based methods are prone to collapse, i.e., all samples are assigned to a single cluster; hence, recent methods heavily rely on extra training techniques or artificial constraints, such as pre-training Yan et al. (2020), sampling strategy Caron et al. (2018), equipartition constraints Asano et al. (2020); Caron et al.

Many SSL approaches rely on extra training techniques and artificial assumptions to prevent collapsing.In clustering-based methods, DeepCluster Caron et al. (2018) adapts a sampling strategy to sample elements uniformly across pseudo-labels to deal with empty clusters; SeLa Asano et al. (2020) and SwAV Caron et al. (2020) impose equipartition constraints to balance the cluster distribution.Similarly, SelfClassifier Amrani et al. (2021) uses a uniform pseudo-label prior, and PCL Li et al. (2021) employs concentration scaling.DINO Caron et al. (2021) and ReSSL Zheng et al. (2021) address collapsing by specific combinations of implementation details, i.e., centering and scaling with an exponential moving average network; their mechanism for preventing collapse is unclear.In this work, we show our method can naturally avoid collapsing without any of these assumptions or training techniques.We achieve results better than baselines with a simple but novel information regularization algorithm.We take a more detailed comparison with SeLa and SwAV after explaining our method in Sec. 3.3."
"Can clustering-based self-supervised approaches learn a piece of local information? If not, task applicability would be limited.","Sampling-based solutions, such as Monte Carlo EM, are not feasible for large datasets because they involve an expensive sampling loop per datapoint, which would be too slow",MIRA does not perform well in the detection task.,"A.7 Experiments on the detection and segmentation task We test our method on detection segmentation of the COCO 2017 dataset with Masked R-CNN, R50-C4 on a 2x scheduled setting. We use the configuration from the MoCo official implementation. MIRA performs better than the supervised baseline and is comparable to MoCo; it is not as dominating as in the classification tasks."
How is MIRA similar or different compared to other clustering-based methods? (e.g. SwaV),"The NAS architecture scales by searching for the best cell structure, which is more likely to generalize to other problems and is faster than searching for an entire network architecture","MIRA does not require any artificial constraints or techniques in training, unlike other self-supervised methods. However, MIRA uses some of the techniques used in the other paper.","The pseudo-code of MIRA for representation learning with Eq. 8 is provided in the Appendix.In the following experiments, we verify the effectiveness of MIRA for a representation learning purpose.We note that MIRA can integrate recently suggested self-supervised learning components, such as exponential moving average (EMA) or multi-crop (MC) augmentation strategy following the baselines Chen et al. (2021); Caron et al. (2020, 2021).For convenience, in the rest of this paper, we call the representation learning with MIRA also as MIRA.We discuss some further details as follows: Despite its conceptual simplicity, a naive application of clustering to representation learning is hard to achieve, especially when training with large-scale datasets.This is because clustering-based methods are prone to collapse, i.e., all samples are assigned to a single cluster; hence, recent methods heavily rely on extra training techniques or artificial constraints, such as pre-training Yan et al. (2020), sampling strategy Caron et al. (2018), equipartition constraints Asano et al. (2020); Caron et al. (2020), to avoid collapsing.However, it is unclear if these additions are appropriate or how such components will affect the representation quality. SeLa Asano et al. (2020) and SwAV Caron et al. (2020) formulate their pseudo-labeling process into optimization problems, i.e., optimal transport (OT) problem, and solve it iteratively with Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm Cuturi (2013).To avoid collapse and apply the SK algorithm, they assume the equipartition of data into clusters.Mathematically, the difference to MIRA is in how to deal with the marginal entropy.SeLa and SwAV constrain the marginal entropy to maximum value–equipartition while MIRA decides it by MI regularization333Adding the equipartition constraint into Eq. 4, our problem converts to the OT problem of SwAV Caron et al. (2020)..Asano et al. (2020) argue that their pseudo-labels with the OT problem maximize the MI between labels and data indices under the equipartition constraint.However, it more resembles assuming MI maximization and then finding the cluster assignments that are optimal transport to the model prediction.In contrast, MIRA directly maximizes the MI by regularization without artificial constraints.While SwAV performs better than SeLa in most self-supervised benchmarks, we verify that MIRA improves over SwAV in various downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose Mutual Information Regularized Assignment (MIRA), a pseudo-labeling algorithm that enables clustering-based SSL without any artificial constraints or extra training techniques.MIRA is designed to follow the infomax principle Linsker (1988) and the intuition that good labels are something that can reduce most of the uncertainty about the data.Our method assigns a pseudo-label in a principled way by constructing an optimization problem.For a given training model that predicts pseudo-labels, the optimization problem finds a solution that maximizes the mutual information (MI) between the pseudo-labels and data while considering the model probability.We formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem and derive the necessary and sufficient condition of solution with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition.This solution can be achieved by fixed-point iteration that we prove the convergence.We remark that MIRA does not require any form of extra training techniques or artificial constraints, e.g., equipartition constraints. Our contributions are summarized as follows:•We propose MIRA, a simple and principled pseudo-label assignment algorithm based on mutual information.Our method does not require extra training techniques or artificial constraints.•We apply MIRA to clustering-based representation learning, showing comparable performance against the state-of-the-art methods with half of the training epochs.Specifically, MIRA achieves 75.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet linear evaluation with only 400 epochs of training and the best performance in 9 out of 11 datasets in transfer learning.•Representation by MIRA also consistently improves over other information-based SSL methods.Especially our method without multi-crop augmentation achieves 74.1% top-1 accuracy and outperforms BarlowTwins Zbontar et al.

What are the benefits of applying clustering-based methods to self-supervised learning? ,"No.

What is mutual information means in the paper?,The two tasks from each category were chosen based on their similarity in terms of computational complexity and the type of optimization problem,Mutual information between pseudo-label and data without any artificial constraints.,"We argue that such pseudo-labels should maximize the mutual information (MI) between themselves and data while accounting for the model probabilities \bm{P}.Let \mathcal{B}\in\{1,...,B\} and \mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}}\in\{1,...,K\} be the random variables associated with the data index in mini-batch and labels by probability distributions \bm{W}=\{\bm{w}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{B}, respectively.Our online pseudo-label (cluster) assignment is determined by solving the following optimization problem:\displaystyle\bm{W^{*}}\displaystyle=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\bm{W}\subset\Delta_{K}}\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}D_{\text{KL}}(\bm{w}_{i},\bm{p}_{i})-\beta\hat{I}(\mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}};\mathcal{B}),(1)where \Delta_{K}\coloneqq\{\bm{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{K}_{+}\mid\bm{w}^{\intercal}\bm{1}_{K}=1\}, \hat{I} indicates an empirical (Monte Carlo) estimates of MI, and \beta is a trade-off parameter.The problem consists of the (1) KL divergence term that makes pseudo-labels to be based on the model probability \bm{p} and (2) MI term between the pseudo-labels and data to induce more information about data into the pseudo-labels.By combining these two terms, we provide a refined pseudo-label that take account of both the model probability and MI. To make the optimization problem tractable, we substitute the MI term \hat{I} with the mini-batch estimates of the entropy \hat{H}(\mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}}|\mathcal{B}) and marginal entropy \hat{H}(\mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}}) in Eq. 2. We get:\displaystyle\hat{I}(\mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}};\mathcal{B})=\hat{H}(\mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}})-\hat{H}(\mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}}|\mathcal{B})=-\sum_{j=1}^{K}\bar{w}_{j}\log{\bar{w}_{j}}+\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}\sum_{j=1}^{K}w_{ij}\log{w_{ij}},(2)\displaystyle\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}D_{\text{KL}}(\bm{w}_{i},\bm{p}_{i})=-\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}\sum_{j=1}^{K}w_{ij}\log{p_{ij}}+\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}\sum_{j=1}^{K}w_{ij}\log{w_{ij}},(3)\displaystyle\bm{W^{*}}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\bm{W}\subset\Delta_{K}}-\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}\sum_{j=1}^{K}w_{ij}\log{p_{ij}}+\frac{1-\beta}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}\sum_{j=1}^{K}w_{ij}\log{w_{ij}}+\beta\sum_{j=1}^{K}\overline{w}_{j}\log{\overline{w}_{j}},(4)where \overline{w}_{j}=\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}w_{ij} is the marginal probability of a cluster j with \bm{W}.In practice, we find the optimal point \bm{W}^{*} of the optimization problem Eq. 4 for pseudo-labeling.

However, in RoBERTa paper, author said that removing NSP improves downstream task performance. Therefore, point of views in terms of NSP is different between BERT and RoBERTa.","The NSP loss was hypothesized to be an important factor in training the original BERT model. Devlin et al.

(2019); Joshi et al. (2019). We next compare training without the NSP loss and training with blocks of text from a single document (doc-sentences).We find that this setting outperforms the originally published BERT{}_{\textsc{base}} results and that removing the NSP loss matches or slightly improves downstream task performance, in contrast to Devlin et al.

However, RoBERTa takes four sequences as input not like BERT.","BERT takes as input a concatenation of two segments (sequences of tokens), x_{1},\ldots,x_{N} and y_{1},\ldots,y_{M}.Segments usually consist of more than one natural sentence.The two segments are presented as a single input sequence to BERT with special tokens delimiting them: [\mathit{CLS}],x_{1},\ldots,x_{N},[\mathit{SEP}],y_{1},\ldots,y_{M},[\mathit{EOS}].M and N are constrained such that M+N<T, where T is a parameter that controls the maximum sequence length during training. We modify RoBERTa for this task by concatenating each candidate answer with the corresponding question and passage.We then encode each of these four sequences and pass the resulting [CLS] representations through a fully-connected layer, which is used to predict the correct answer.We truncate question-answer pairs that are longer than 128 tokens and, if needed, the passage so that the total length is at most 512 tokens."
How many tokens are changed to [MASK] in BERT training? Give a ratio.,"True. The proposed model accumulates the feature vector of neighboring nodes together regardless of type and direction of an edge, based on a message-passing framework",80% of tokens are replaced with [MASK] during training.,"A random sample of the tokens in the input sequence is selected and replaced with the special token [\mathit{MASK}]. The MLM objective is a cross-entropy loss on predicting the masked tokens. BERT uniformly selects 15% of the input tokens for possible replacement. Of the selected tokens, 80% are replaced with [\mathit{MASK}], 10% are left unchanged, and 10% are replaced by a randomly selected vocabulary token."
RoBERTa uses large batch size. How many times larger than BERT-large one?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The exact retrieval increases the latency significantly compared to approximate nearest neighbor search","RoBERTa use 32 times larger batch size than BERT because batch size of BERT and RoBERTa are 256 and 8K, respectively.","Devlin et al. (2019) originally trained BERT{}_{\textsc{base}} for 1M steps with a batch size of 256 sequences.This is equivalent in computational cost, via gradient accumulation, to training for 125K steps with a batch size of 2K sequences, or for 31K steps with a batch size of 8K. In Table 3 we compare perplexity and end-task performance of BERT{}_{\textsc{base}} as we increase the batch size, controlling for the number of passes through the training data.We observe that training with large batches improves perplexity for the masked language modeling objective, as well as end-task accuracy.Large batches are also easier to parallelize via distributed data parallel training,888Large batch training can improve training efficiency even without large scale parallel hardware through gradient accumulation, whereby gradients from multiple mini-batches are accumulated locally before each optimization step. This functionality is supported natively in fairseq Ott et al. (2019). and in later experiments we train with batches of 8K sequences."
Why RoBERTa uses Dynamic masking rather than Static masking?,"A long-tailed app refers to an app that has a small number of installations among a large number of users, but the users who do install it tend to have strong personalized interests in it",They use dynamic masking to avoid using the same mask in iteration.,"As discussed in Section 2, BERT relies on randomly masking and predicting tokens.The original BERT implementation performed masking once during data preprocessing, resulting in a single static mask.To avoid using the same mask for each training instance in every epoch, training data was duplicated 10 times so that each sequence is masked in 10 different ways over the 40 epochs of training.Thus, each training sequence was seen with the same mask four times during training."
Why author said that “the data used for pretraining” have been under-emphesized? Give an evidence data on Table 4.,To reduce computational cost and improve performance by leveraging shared contextual information,Author said that “the data used for pretraining” have been under-emphesized. Because they improved model performance by using additional training data for pretraining.,"In summary, the contributions of this paper are: (1) We present a set of important BERT design choices and training strategies and introduce alternatives that lead to better downstream task performance; (2) We use a novel dataset, CC-News, and confirm that using more data for pretraining further improves performance on downstream tasks; (3) Our training improvements show that masked language model pretraining, under the right design choices, is competitive with all other recently published methods. We release our model, pretraining and fine-tuning code implemented in PyTorch Paszke et al. (2017). Next, we combine this data with the three additional datasets described in Section 3.2.We train RoBERTa over the combined data with the same number of training steps as before (100K).In total, we pretrain over 160GB of text.We observe further improvements in performance across all downstream tasks, validating the importance of data size and diversity in pretraining.999Our experiments conflate increases in data size and diversity. We leave a more careful analysis of these two dimensions to future work."
Why author said that they adopt a much simpler approach for SQuAD compared to past work?,"Meta-learning is a machine learning technique that involves training a model on a set of tasks, such that the trained model can quickly adapt to new tasks using only a small number of examples or training iterations","Author said that they adopt a much simpler approach for SQuAD compared to past work to emphasize that they only finetune RoBERTa using the SQuAD training data, and they use the same learning rate for all layers, not like previous works.","We adopt a much simpler approach for SQuAD compared to past work.In particular, while both BERT Devlin et al. (2019) and XLNet Yang et al. (2019) augment their training data with additional QA datasets, we only finetune RoBERTa using the provided SQuAD training data.Yang et al. (2019) also employed a custom layer-wise learning rate schedule to finetune XLNet, while we use the same learning rate for all layers."
How can author said that their results illustrate the importance of previously overlooked design decisions on BERT?,"Yes.

The paper shows that the learnt user intents by clustering are orthogonal to the sequence embeddings by ensuring that the intent factors are orthogonal to the sequence embeddings, which is necessary to avoid redundant information and improve the performance of the SR model","They could say that the importance of previously overlooked design decisions on BERT, because they improved the performance significantly by training the model longer, with bigger batches over more data; removing the next sentence prediction objective; training on longer sequences; and dynamically changing the masking pattern applied to the training data.","We carefully evaluate a number of design decisions when pretraining BERT models.We find that performance can be substantially improved by training the model longer, with bigger batches over more data; removing the next sentence prediction objective; training on longer sequences; and dynamically changing the masking pattern applied to the training data.Our improved pretraining procedure, which we call RoBERTa, achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD, without multi-task finetuning for GLUE or additional data for SQuAD.These results illustrate the importance of these previously overlooked design decisions and suggest that BERT’s pretraining objective remains competitive with recently proposed alternatives."
Why author said that it can be challenging to determine which aspects of the methods contribute the most?,τ=0.995,"It is challenging to determine which aspects of the methods contribute the most since training is computationally expensive, limiting the amount of tuning that can be done, and is often done with private training data of varying sizes, limiting our ability to measure the effects of the modeling advances.","Self-training methods such as ELMo Peters et al. (2018), GPT Radford et al. (2018), BERT Devlin et al. (2019), XLM Lample and Conneau (2019), and XLNet Yang et al. (2019) have brought significant performance gains, but it can be challenging to determine which aspects of the methods contribute the most. Training is computationally expensive, limiting the amount of tuning that can be done, and is often done with private training data of varying sizes, limiting our ability to measure the effects of the modeling advances."
Explain the author’s motivation to make CC-News dataset.,"MS-Celeb-1M and VGGface2 differ in depth vs. breadth, long tail distribution, and data engineering practices. MS-Celeb-1M has breadth with many subjects but limited images per subject, while VGGface2 has depth with limited subjects but many images per subject. Megaface utilizes the whole distribution, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 2469 images per person. Long tail distribution is used differently among datasets, with MS-Celeb-1M's novel set studying low-shot learning, and Megaface using the whole distribution to contain as many images as possible. Data engineering practices are more inclined towards industry participants, as evidenced by the leaderboards being mostly occupied by companies with invincible hardware and data scales",The motivation of making CC-News dataset is most additional datasets in previous works are not available.,"BERT-style pretraining crucially relies on large quantities of text. Baevski et al. (2019) demonstrate that increasing data size can result in improved end-task performance. Several efforts have trained on datasets larger and more diverse than the original BERT Radford et al. (2019); Yang et al. (2019); Zellers et al. (2019).Unfortunately, not all of the additional datasets can be publicly released. For our study, we focus on gathering as much data as possible for experimentation, allowing us to match the overall quality and quantity of data as appropriate for each comparison."
"Does RoBERTa also takes as input a concatenation of two segments, as well as BERT did?","Meta learning is better than transfer learning because it allows for more flexible and efficient adaptation to new tasks, without requiring a large amount of training data or a separate model for each task","RoBERTa takes concatenated four sequence ,candidate answer with the corresponding question and passage, input not like BERT.","We modify RoBERTa for this task by concatenating each candidate answer with the corresponding question and passage.We then encode each of these four sequences and pass the resulting [CLS] representations through a fully-connected layer, which is used to predict the correct answer.We truncate question-answer pairs that are longer than 128 tokens and, if needed, the passage so that the total length is at most 512 tokens."
BERT originally trained with a batch size of 256 sequences and RoBERTa simply followed that. Is this true? ,"Vast variations are possible with dreambooth, including changes to the subject's place, properties such as color, species, shape, pose, expression, material, and other semantic modifications","No, they used bigger batch size than BERT.","We present a replication study of BERT pretraining Devlin et al. (2019), which includes a careful evaluation of the effects of hyperparmeter tuning and training set size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained and propose an improved recipe for training BERT models, which we call RoBERTa, that can match or exceed the performance of all of the post-BERT methods.Our modifications are simple, they include: (1) training the model longer, with bigger batches, over more data; (2) removing the next sentence prediction objective; (3) training on longer sequences; and (4) dynamically changing the masking pattern applied to the training data. We also collect a large new dataset (CC-News) of comparable size to other privately used datasets, to better control for training set size effects."
Why does zero-shot evaluation has been suggested as a genuine measure for reasoning capability?,"Larger values of β can lead to an increase in the level of overlap between the latent dimensions, but can also cause the encodings to collapse to a mode and result in a mismatch between the approximate posterior and the prior",It is hard to measure reasoning capability using individual datasets because the model cannot learn how to perform general semantic reasoning.,"The ability to understand natural language through commonsense reasoning is one of the core focuses in the field of natural language processing. To measure and study the different aspects of commonsense reasoning, several datasets are developed, such as SocialIQA (Sap et al., 2019b), CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018), and PhysicalIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), each requiring different type of commonsense knowledge (e.g., social, taxonomic, causal, declarative, etc) to select the correct answer. While large-scale neural systems (Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019b) have shown human-level accuracy on these benchmarks, recent studies (Mitra et al., 2019) also criticize that these models solve individual datasets, rather than learning how to perform general semantic reasoning. To this end, Ma et al. (2021) suggested zero-shot evaluation as a genuine measure for the reasoning capability of the machine."
What is AdapterFusion?,"The big reason is that the suitability of a control signal depends on the specific image sample, which can be difficult to determine in advance",AdapterFusion is one of the multi-task learning method based on attention-like mechanism. It aggregates pre-trained adapters in a non-destructive manner mitigating catastrophic forgetting and interference between tasks.,"To address these limitations, we propose a novel, modularized framework that aims to learn multiple expert models for KGs, then conduct zero-shot fusion to allow collaboration among KGs. For this purpose, we leverage AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) where multiple tiny modules between Transformer blocks called adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019) can be combined after independent training, thus allowing a continual integration of the adapters without retraining the entire framework. Specifically, we treat the adapters as different KG-specific experts, and combine them using an attention-like fusion module. To improve the fusion of adapters, we suggest a KG-alignment adapter that guides to the apt expert adapters. Here, we use KGs in three different synthetic supervision training: (1) KG-specific QA datasets to train the KG-specific expert adapters, (2) a KG classification datasets to train the KG-alignment adapter, and (3) a balanced mixture of KG-specific QA datasets to train the fusion module. Our modularized method alleviates the interference between different KGs, which is the pitfall of MTL from our empirical observation, and thus combines multiple KGs into a synergetic zero-shot framework. To address this problem, AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) has been proposed to fuse task specific parameters called adapters for the given target task leveraging attention-like mechanism. AdapterFusion aggregates adapters, which is trained independently for each task, in a non-destructive manner mitigating aforementioned MTL problems such as forgetting and interference between tasks. Recently, it has been used for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer framework (Pfeiffer et al., 2020c; Wang et al., 2021b), which motivates our work to transfer multi-source knowledge with less interference for zero-shot commonsense reasoning."
How do the authors generate synthetic QA?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

We could recognize previously unseen persons using k-NN by simply adding their new embeddings to the existing database and comparing them to the embeddings of known individuals using the same distance metric","They generate syntheticQS by transforming a triplet of KG into question and answer pair. Specifically, they transform the head entity and relation into question and tail entity into an answer using templates.","In our setup, we repurpose synthetic QA generation (Ma et al., 2021) for the task of knowledge-driven zero-shot learning for commonsense reasoning, i.e., we transform a KG into multiple (Q_{i},A_{i}) pairs where Q_{i} is a natural language question and A_{i}=\{A_{i,1},...,A_{i,m}\} is the set of options with m answer candidates. Specifically, given a triple (e^{head},r,e^{tail}) in a KG, where e^{head}, e^{tail} and r denote head/tail entity and relation respectively, we transform e^{head} and r into a natural language question Q_{i} using templates. For the option set A_{i}, we use the combination of the correct answer e^{tail} and m-1 distractors which are tail entities from other triples sampled randomly (Ma et al., 2021). Details are described in Appendix B."
What is the main weak point of conventional Multi-task learning for zero-shot learning with multiple types of commonsense knowledge? ,76k database images and 315 query images,"Conventional Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is known to be prone to interference between various tasks, as well as a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting, wherein the model struggles to retain knowledge of different types acquired during MTL.","To consider different types of reasoning, this paper extends ideas from the aforementioned zero-shot learning to the multi-source case such that it benefits from different types of commonsense knowledge on individual KGs. For example, ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019a) focuses on social commonsense while ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) contains conceptual knowledge. A practical approach is multi-task learning (MTL; Caruana, 1997; Liu et al., 2019a), which learns a shared encoder for different synthetic QA datasets from multiple KGs. Despite its effectiveness, MTL scheme suffers from interference among different KGs, which results in forgetting previously learned knowledge when trained on new KG which has different kinds of knowledge (Pilault et al., 2021; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a; Wu et al., 2020). MTL (Liu et al., 2019a; Zhang and Yang, 2017; Caruana, 1997) learns a shared representation while aggregating knowledge across multiple learning tasks, often leading to better generalization ability of a model. However, parametric aggregation of knowledge with MTL has following limitations: (1) retraining the full model when adding new tasks (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2021, 2020b) (2) catastrophic forgetting and interference between tasks leading to difficulties of solving each task equally well (Pilault et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020) and (3) inconsistent effect (Lourie et al., 2021). To deal with these challenges, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a parameterized generalization of ensembling techniques, which has been adapted for MTL with gating network trained to optimize each task (Ma et al., 2018). However, simple linear gating networks are too shallow and thus may destruct task knowledge for commonsense reasoning."
Why is KG Modularization needed?,Density of candidate object locations,"KG modularization is crucial for maintaining the intrinsic knowledge of each individual KG. As the selection and alignment of an appropriate KG has been shown to have a significant impact on downstream tasks, it is important that the model is able to learn the subtle differences between each KG without any interference from other KGs.","First, we modularize the KGs to preserve their intrinsic knowledge. Considering the importance of using a suitable and well-aligned KG (Ma et al., 2019, 2021) on a downstream task, the subtle difference between each KG should be learned by the model without any interference from each other. Accordingly, we adopt the adapter module (Houlsby et al., 2019) which repurposes a pre- trained language model (PLM) to incorporate each KG as tiny modules in between Transformer blocks. Specifically, as illustrated in Figure 2 (except for green area), the adapter training strategy involves injecting new layers (parameterized by Φ) into the original PLM (parameterized by θ). The weights of the original PLM are untouched, while the new adapter layers are initialized at random. Formally, we call each adapter trained with DkQA as an expert adapter for KG k, parameterized by ΦkQA."
What are the advantages of KG modularization using adapters?,10 extra images are generated for each class,Adapter enables to store the corresponding knowledge separately without any interference. We can parallelize the training of the adapter for all KGs. The efficiency of adapter training allows our modularization to be more scalable.,"where KG-invariant parameters θ are fixed and only KG-dependent parameters Φk QA are learned, which enables to store the corresponding knowledge separately without any interference. Further, we can parallelize the training of the adapter for all KGs. The efficiency of adapter training allows our modularization to be more scalable."
How does the author show the mitigation of interference?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

FaceNet uses an online triplet mining method to train its embedding",Use interference ratio.,"Using the interference ratio, we can precisely compare the negative effects of multi-KG models on knowledge aggregation since the only reason to get the correct samples wrong is the interference caused by learning with additional KGs. We present the interference ratio of the models on five benchmark datasets in Figure 5. This figure shows that MTL has the higher interference ratio than the competing models across all benchmarks. Our method achieves a substantially better ratio, especially when KG-C adapter is used. This demonstrates the efficacy of our framework in mitigating interference between knowledge, which is one of the major problems of MTL."
What is the difference between zero-shot fusion and original AdapterFusion?,"YOLO makes far fewer background errors than Fast R-CNN. Specifically, YOLO makes less than half the number of background errors compared to Fast R-CNN","In contrast to AdapterFusion where the focus is learning to transfer knowledge to a specific target task, our zero-shot fusion aims to generalize this transfer to any arbitrary target task.","Once the expert adapters are learned, we combine the knowledge from each expert adapter using an attention-like mechanism. We present a novel fusion strategy as shown in Figure 2, which is referred to as the zero-shot fusion. In contrast to AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) where the focus islearning to transfer knowledge to a specific targettask, our zero-shot fusion aims to generalize this transfer to any arbitrary target task. Specifically, the zero-shot fusion parameters Ψ learn to combine fixed expert adapters which are parameterized by Φ_1 QA, ..., Φ K QA. In each Transformer layer l of PLM with the injected fusion layer, the zero-shot fusion parameters ΨQA consist of query, key, and value matrices, denoted by WQ_l, WK_l, and WV_l respectively. These parameters are used to learn the balancing between the representation of each expert adapters through attention-like mechanism. While fixing both the parameters θ and all expert adapters Φ_1 QA, ..., Φ_K QA, the only trainable weights ΨQA on the fusion layer learns to combine the knowledge from different K expert adapters by using the subset of {Dk QA} K k=1 by random sampling. Here, we balance the ratio between the K knowledge-driven datasets as N samples (details are in Appendix D)."
Which dataset is used for fusion layer training?,"The approach needs a gating mechanism because a good retrieval function alone may not be sufficient to filter out irrelevant feedback from the memory, especially in tasks with high surface-level similarity among past feedback. The gating mechanism helps to ignore irrelevant feedback and ensure that the model is not misled by incorrect or harmful feedback",a balanced mixture of KG-specific QA datasets to train the fusion module.,"To address these limitations, we propose a novel, modularized framework that aims to learn multiple expert models for KGs, then conduct zero-shot fusion to allow collaboration among KGs.

Why is KG-Classifier adapter suggested?,,"To compensate that usage a mixture of synthetic QA for fusion training, which is not exactly a training task.","AdapterFusion uses the PLM hidden representation h^l_P LM as a query which is learned when training on a specific downstream task. In our zero-shot setting, however, we use a mixture of synthetic QA for fusion training, which is not exactly a training"
Which dataset is used for KG-Classifier adapter training?,"No. According to the formula provided, the attention context \mathbf{a}_{i} is computed using the decoder-RNN output from the past decoding time step, specifically \mathbf{y}_{i-1}. The output from the bottom decoder layer is not used directly for computing the attention context","For KG-Classifier adapter training, KG classification dataset has been used. This dataset is generate by transforming a QA sample into a KG classification sample, using the concatenation of question and answer of synthetic QA as a question and the KG source as an answer.","To address these limitations, we propose a novel, modularized framework that aims to learn multiple expert models for KGs, then conduct zero-shot fusion to allow collaboration among KGs.

Then, we obtain a new label yi ∈ {0, 1} K indicating the corresponding KG source. The samples are in Appendix E. Formally, KG classification dataset DKGC is defined as: DKGC = {([Qi ; Ai,label], yi)} M_i=1 (9) where M is the total size of {Dk QA} K k=1."
Which benchmark has been used for evaluation?,"YOLOv3 improves upon previous versions of the YOLO object detection algorithm by incorporating a hybrid approach of 3x3 and 1x1 convolutional layers, shortcut connections, and a larger network size (53 convolutional layers) resulting in faster and more accurate object detection","We evaluate our proposed framework on five question-answering benchmarks for commonsense reasoning: SocialIQA (SIQA) (Sap et al., 2019b), CommonsenseQA (CSQA) (Talmor et al., 2018), Abductive NLI (a-NLI) (Bhagavatula et al., 2020), PhysicalIQA (PIQA) (Bisk et al., 2020), and WinoGrande (WG) (Sakaguchi et al., 2020).",We evaluate our proposed framework on five question-answering benchmarks for commonsense

Specifically, we experiment two architectural choices: PLM (STLPLM) and PLM with adapters (STL-Adapter). For each architecture, there are four STL models for each of synthetic QA datasets derived from ATOMIC, ConceptNet, WikiData, and WordNet. We note that the trained STLAdapter is an expert adapter from a specific KG in our framework. The performance of each STL baseline is shown in Appendix I Table 9 and Table 10."
What is the difference in test results according to the presence or absence of adapters?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The generator may not perform as well when the target corpus has different query/document (answer) distributions from the training datasets. This is because the generator is trained on a specific distribution of queries and documents, and may not generalize well to different distributions. For example, if users in the target application often ask much longer questions (e.g., longer than 12 tokens), the generator may not be able to handle such long queries effectively, leading to reduced performance",KG-C adapter improves the average accuracy of zero-shot fusion by 0.4%,"Moreover, as an ablation, we compare the zeroshot fusion with and without KG-C adapter to explore the efficacy of the KG-C adapter. We can observe that zero-shot fusion with KG-C adapter improves the average accuracy by 0.4%, which implies that the use of KG-C adapter improves the overall performance and makes our method generalize better on most of the evaluation benchmarks."
How does KG-Classifier affect zero-shot fusion?,"Lazy evaluation is an evaluation strategy in which an expression is only evaluated when its value is actually needed, rather than when it is defined. In the context of MXNet, this means that the framework defers the actual computation of NDArrays until they are actually needed, allowing for more efficient use of resources and improved performance",zero-shot fusion with KG-C adapter fuses the knowledge from different experts with a subtle difference rather than focusing on a single expert severely.,"Further, we explore how the KG-C adapter affects zero-shot fusion which is based on an attention-like mechanism (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) compared to zero-shot fusion without KG-C adapter. Here, while zero-shot fusion without KGC adapter simply uses the representation of PLM as a query, zero-shot fusion with KG-C adapter leverages the representation of KG-C adapter. To illustrate this strength, we visualize the attention probability of [CLS] token from each fusion layer as a representative in Figure 4. The column of the darker cell indicates the adapter that has the bigger influence on the fused representation. We can observe that zero-shot fusion with KG-C adapter fuses the knowledge from different experts with a subtle difference rather than focusing on a single expert severely. This implies that KG-C adapter enables the delicate balancing between multiple knowledge sources based on the KG-alignment awareness, which leads to performance improvements in commonsense reasoning tasks. Interestingly, both cases have the ability not to focus on the expert adapter based on WikiData, which can be seen as a redundant expert.4 This observation would benefit from the further study that explores the optimal combination of KGs by expert selection or rejection."
What is the correlation between the number of KGs and the performance when using zero-shot fusion?,"The patterns are defined between pairs of tokens because the authors are interested in modeling the ""attending to matching tokens"" behavior, where the attention value between two tokens is high when they are the same. This is more easily captured by considering pairs of tokens rather than larger groups",Zero-shot fusion obtains relative performance improvement across most of benchmark when more KGs are utilized for training.,"In Figure 6, while the MTL tends to show the decrease of the performance when more KGs are utilized for training, our method obtains relative performance improvement across most of benchmarks. In both framework, the slightly degraded performance of the combination of KGs without ATOMIC could be due to the strong alignment between ATOMIC and SIQA. Except for the above case, we can observe that as more KGs are leveraged, the color of the cell gets greener, which implies that our method gains more advantages for better performance. This demonstrates that our method enables knowledge aggregation for multiple KGs synergetically."
Why is neural integration of different KGs better than symbolic KG integration?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

To address the issue of overfitting on rare relations and to reduce the size of the model","Rather than such symbolic KG integration with the inevitable loss of knowledge, in this work, we explore the neural KG integration leveraging the multiple KGs without additional processing and alignment information between KG and task.","However, most of existing work are either assuming the existence of the alignment information between tasks and KGs (Banerjee and Baral, 2020) or an integrated KG (Ma et al., 2021). For example, \texttt{ATOMIC}^{20}_{20} (Hwang et al., 2021), a commonsense KG which incorporates tuples from ConceptNet and ATOMIC with new relations and further crowdsourcing, combines multiple KGs into a new integrated KG, but as widely known (Ilievski et al., 2020; Hwang et al., 2021), heterogeneous schema between different KGs may limit triplets that can be integrated.111Only 172K tuples of the 3.4M tuples and 5 relations of 36 relations in ConceptNet are integrated into \texttt{ATOMIC}^{20}_{20}. Rather than such symbolic KG integration with the inevitable loss of knowledge, in this work, we explore the neural KG integration leveraging the multiple KGs without additional processing and alignment information between KG and task."
What are the limitations of the parametric aggregation of knowledge with MTL?,"Lower FVD value does not necessarily mean more coherent generation.

FVD (Frame-to-Video Distance) is a metric that measures the difference between the generated video and the target video. A lower FVD value indicates that the generated video is more similar to the target video. However, a low FVD value does not necessarily guarantee that the generated video is coherent.

Coherence is a subjective measure that depends on the quality of the generated video, the relevance of the generated video to the input text, and the overall aesthetic appeal of the video. A coherent video should have a clear narrative, consistent motion, and visually appealing elements. It should also be grounded in the input text and maintain a consistent tone and style throughout.

In the context of T2V (Text-to-Video) generation, coherence is particularly important because it directly affects the quality of the generated video. A coherent video is more likely to engage the viewer and convey the intended message effectively.

Therefore, while a low FVD value is a good starting point for evaluating the quality of a generated video, it is not the only factor that determines coherence. Human evaluation and subjective assessment are also crucial for evaluating the quality and coherence of a generated video",(1) retraining the full model when adding new tasks (2) catastrophic forgetting and interference between tasks leading to difficulties of solving each task equally well and (3) inconsistent effect,"To consider different types of reasoning, this paper extends ideas from the aforementioned zero-shot learning to the multi-source case such that it benefits from different types of commonsense knowledge on individual KGs. For example, ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019a) focuses on social commonsense while ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) contains conceptual knowledge. A practical approach is multi-task learning (MTL; Caruana, 1997; Liu et al., 2019a), which learns a shared encoder for different synthetic QA datasets from multiple KGs. Despite its effectiveness, MTL scheme suffers from interference among different KGs, which results in forgetting previously learned knowledge when trained on new KG which has different kinds of knowledge (Pilault et al., 2021; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a; Wu et al., 2020). MTL (Liu et al., 2019a; Zhang and Yang, 2017; Caruana, 1997) learns a shared representation while aggregating knowledge across multiple learning tasks, often leading to better generalization ability of a model. However, parametric aggregation of knowledge with MTL has following limitations: (1) retraining the full model when adding new tasks (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2021, 2020b) (2) catastrophic forgetting and interference between tasks leading to difficulties of solving each task equally well (Pilault et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020) and (3) inconsistent effect (Lourie et al., 2021). To deal with these challenges, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a parameterized generalization of ensembling techniques, which has been adapted for MTL with gating network trained to optimize each task (Ma et al., 2018). However, simple linear gating networks are too shallow and thus may destruct task knowledge for commonsense reasoning. To address this problem, AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) has been proposed to fuse task specific parameters called adapters for the given target task leveraging attention-like mechanism. AdapterFusion aggregates adapters, which is trained independently for each task, in a non-destructive manner mitigating aforementioned MTL problems such as forgetting and interference between tasks. Recently, it has been used for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer framework (Pfeiffer et al., 2020c; Wang et al., 2021b), which motivates our work to transfer multi-source knowledge with less interference for zero-shot commonsense reasoning."
How does the author convert the triplet in KG into synthetic QA specifically?,mAP (mean Average Precision),"given a triple (e^{head},r,e^{tail}) in a KG, where e^{head}, e^{tail} and r denote head/tail entity and relation respectively, we transform e^{head} and r into a natural language question Q_{i} using templates.","In our setup, we repurpose synthetic QA generation (Ma et al., 2021) for the task of knowledge-driven zero-shot learning for commonsense reasoning, i.e., we transform a KG into multiple (Q_{i},A_{i}) pairs where Q_{i} is a natural language question and A_{i}=\{A_{i,1},...,A_{i,m}\} is the set of options with m answer candidates. Specifically, given a triple (e^{head},r,e^{tail}) in a KG, where e^{head}, e^{tail} and r denote head/tail entity and relation respectively, we transform e^{head} and r into a natural language question Q_{i} using templates. For the option set A_{i}, we use the combination of the correct answer e^{tail} and m-1 distractors which are tail entities from other triples sampled randomly (Ma et al., 2021). Details are described in Appendix B."
What does MTL stand for?,No,"Conventionally, MTL stands for multiple learning tasks. Here, for experiment, the author call the model pre-trained on multiple synthetic QA datasets as MTL.","MTL (Liu et al., 2019a; Zhang and Yang, 2017; Caruana, 1997) learns a shared representation while aggregating knowledge across multiple learning tasks, often leading to better generalization ability of a model.

What can be the future work related to this paper?,"Significant improvements in performance are seen when expanding the channel size from 64 to 128, particularly on the larger and more diverse JFT-300M dataset","In the future, our work can be extended to adapt our methods to further various multiple KGs with studies of appropriate scale for KG modularization. In addition, based on our hypothesis that the existence of an optimal combination, we can explore the study for the optional use of modularized KG experts for the best transfer learning.","In the future, our work can be extended to adapt our methods to further various multiple KGs with studies of appropriate scale for KG modularization.

Why is there decrease of the performance of the zeor-shot fusion without ATOMIC?,"N, the number of disjoint sets of proposals, is determined based on the annotation nature of the specific CIC dataset","In both framework, the slightly degraded performance of the combination of KGs without ATOMIC could be due to the strong alignment between ATOMIC and SIQA.","In Figure 6, while the MTL tends to show the decrease of the performance when more KGs are utilized for training, our method obtains relative performance improvement across most of benchmarks. In both framework, the slightly degraded performance of the combination of KGs without ATOMIC could be due to the strong alignment between ATOMIC and SIQA. Except for the above case, we can observe that as more KGs are leveraged, the color of the cell gets greener, which implies that our method gains more advantages for better performance. This demonstrates that our method enables knowledge aggregation for multiple KGs synergetically."
What is the main motivation of this work?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Yes, there is a benefit to using fader control instead of numbers (e.g., percentages) for controlling the generated image. Fader control allows for more precise control over the effect induced by a specific word, as it allows the user to adjust the magnitude of the effect continuously, rather than being limited to a set of predefined percentages","This work has been motivated from the fact that real-world QA systems require simultaneously considering different types of reasoning abilities. Therefore, this paper target an arbitrary commonsense reasoning task where conventional approaches are not applicable to such zero-shot learning scenarios.","Inspired by this new metric, in this work, we focus on building unsupervised zero-shot multiple-choice QA systems. That is, we target an arbitrary commonsense reasoning task where conventional approaches (that rely heavily on task-specific supervision) are not applicable to such zero-shot learning scenarios. To learn QA models without expensive annotation efforts, recent works (Ma et al., 2021; Banerjee and Baral, 2020; Malaviya et al., 2020) propose to generate a synthetic QA dataset using a commonsense KG such as ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019a) and ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017). Such an approach mostly focuses only on one specific type of reasoning relations (e.g., if-then relation, or declarative relation), neglecting the fact that real-world QA systems require simultaneously considering different types of reasoning abilities (e.g., declarative and social, or causal and physical reasoning; Ilievski et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2021)."

How does the authors claim that the proposed method could improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff over existing SoTA CNN models?,"Yes, the authors trained the state-of-the-art offline RL algorithm, CRR, with the MultiWOZ dataset",They compared their network with state-of-the-art models in Table 6. Table 6 shows that the baseline model achieved higher accuracy than comparisons with similar latency.,"We apply the proposed NAS method with the supernet architecture described above. The depth of 5 stages is set to 3,4,7,4,11, respectively. The latency constraint is set to 2.5 ms that corresponds to the latency of EfficientNet-B1 on our target NPU, MIDAP. Table 6 compares our search results with the state-of-the-art models: EdgeTPU (Gupta and Akin, 2020), EfficientNet (Tan and Le, 2019a), Once-For-All (Cai et al., 2019). The latency of the other models is obtained by running the network on the MIDAP cycle-accurate simulator. We compare the accuracy without quantization, assuming that quantization effects will be similar to all models. As shown in Table 6, the baseline model, ours-M, found by the proposed NAS technique has higher accuracy than the other models on our target NPU; ours-M achieves more than 1.7% higher top-1 accuracy than EfficientNet-lite2 with similar latency. Moreover, it is 0.5% higher than EfficientNet-B1, even without using SE and h-swish activation function. Note that the number of parameters and the number of FLOPS in ours-M is larger than EfficientNet-B1. It implies that the complexity of the network is not a direct indicator of the end-to-end latency of the network. The end-to-end latency depends on the NPU architecture, and the proposed NAS technique could find a larger network with shorter latency by adding the latency factor to the loss function directly. The main benefit comes from different block assignment to stages. Finally, we selectively removed SE blocks from ours-XL+, resulting in ours-XL-rmSE+. We collected the activation values using randomly sampled 10K images from the training dataset and calculated the metric explained in Sec. 4.3.3.After removing SE blocks from ours-XL+ based on the metric, only about 60% of the blocks in the network have SE blocks. As a result, we could make the latency shorter, while the accuracy was slightly improved than ours-XL+. This model achieves 82.72% top-1 accuracy with only 11.66ms latency.It is much better than EfficientNet-EdgeTPU-L (Gupta and Akin, 2020) that achieves 80.62% FP32 top-1 accuracy with more than 20ms on EdgeTPU. Our architecture on MIDAP is about 2 times faster with 2.1% higher accuracy. In this work, we propose a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology extending the Single-Path NAS technique (Stamoulis et al., 2019). We modify the supernet architecture by varying the number of blocks in stages and adding mixed depthwise convolution (Tan and Le, 2019b) to the search space. By modifying the loss function to directly include the target latency estimated by a cycle-accurate simulator of the target NPU, we could find a better baseline architecture with a shorter latency than the latency constraint. Using a tight latency constraint, we can reduce the search space to find the baseline network fast. Afterward, we apply compound scaling to find a larger network than the baseline network, and add SE blocks and h-swish activation functions in the post-processing step.Through the proposed NAS methodology, we could obtain a network with 82.72% accuracy with 11.66ms latency on our target NPU, without special data augmentation in training. It dominates the existing network models on the target NPU. It confirms the importance of supernet architecture design for a given NPU and effectiveness of the three-step approach in the proposed NAS methodology: supernet design, SinglePath NAS with a tighter latency constraint, and compound scaling and post-processing. Experiments show that the proposed NAS technique could improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff over existing SoTA CNN models. Our best model achieves 82.72% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 11.66ms latency without any special data augmentation. Note that the latency is estimated by cycle-accurate simulation. For a fair comparison with the related work, the latency of each compared network is also estimated with the same simulator."
What is the contribution of this paper?,"To parameterize a bounding box as (tx, ty, tw, th) following the parameterization in [6]","They modify the supernet architecture by varying the number of blocks in stages, and adds MixConv to the search space. This enables more diverse combinations of kernel sizes and expansion ratios than original MixConv. Moreover, they eases the search process. As a result, they could find a better network than existing network models. Note that their method can be used to any type of NPU.","Even though the proposed methodology can be applied to any type of NPU, the current implementation is made for an adder-tree type NPU, called MIDAP (Kanget al., 2019).It has a fully-pipelined micro-architecture that consists of separate hardware modules and memory modules for convolution, activation function, and various reduction operations. Since it enables us to make a fully static schedule of operations without resource contention in the data path, we can estimate the end-to-end latency of a CNN quite accurately analytically. Unexpected delay may incur from off-chip DRAM delay that is not fully hidden by double buffering. Figure 6 depicts our building block structure. This block starts and ends with 1×1 convolution, with N searchable superkernels in the middle. Each searchable superkernel is designed similarly to Eq. (3), while we may use different threshold values in each superkernel. The kernel sizes and expansion ratios are selected among predetermined values. If the j-th searchable superkernel chooses an expansion ratio e_{j}, the j-th kernel has e_{j} times more channels than the first 1×1 convolution. Compared with the original MixConv suggested in (Tan and Le, 2019b), the proposed building block supports more diverse combinations of kernel sizes and expansion ratios. It enhances the efficiency of search results on our target NPU (Table 5). We propose to modify the loss function to activate the latency-aware loss term only when the estimated latency is larger than the latency constraint as follows:(9)CE+\lambda_{1}\cdot log(1+\lambda_{2}\cdot ReLU((\sum L)-T))Although this is not a panacea, this modification significantly eases the search process, which will be discussed in section 5.2 with various experiments. Figure 11 depicts an example distribution of activation values produced by two different SE blocks for three different images. The authors of the original paper (Hu et al., 2018) conjectured that if such distribution from a SE block does not differ widely between image classes, the SE block is not important. Thus, after training, they obtained averaged activation values of a SE block over multiple images in the same class.They compared the distributions of the averaged values over different image classes. They observed that removing the SE blocks that have similar distributions over different image classes incurs only a marginal loss in accuracy. In this work, we propose a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology extending the Single-Path NAS technique (Stamoulis et al., 2019). We modify the supernet architecture by varying the number of blocks in stages and adding mixed depthwise convolution (Tan and Le, 2019b) to the search space.

Why focusing on latency-aware NAS is important?,"The variants of LSTM encoder-decoder models used in this study are:

1. Conditional LSTM decoder, conditioned on the last generated frame.
2. Unconditional LSTM decoder, not conditioned on any previous frames","Other criteria, such as complexity of the network or the number of MAC operations, is not a proper measure of latency. Thus targeting on latency is important.","As shown in Table 6, the baseline model, ours-M, found by the proposed NAS technique has higher accuracy than the other models on our target NPU; ours-M achieves more than 1.7% higher top-1 accuracy than EfficientNet-lite2 with similar latency.

The main benefit comes from different block assignment to stages. One of the most closely related work is the recently proposed NAS technique tailored for Google’s Edge-TPU [9]. While MBConv is widely used for GPU-aware NAS techniques, they prefer to use a single full convolution by fusing expansion layer and DWConv layer in some parts of the network, observing that the Edge-TPU runs the fused full convolution faster even though the required number of MAC (multiply-accumulate) operations is much larger. It confirms that the number of MAC operations is not a proper measure of latency, and platform-specific performance estimation is required."
"How ""superkernel"" is different from supernet?
",R-FCN was unable to converge using only one score map because it lacks the ability to capture spatial information,A superkernel is a component for searching expansion ratio and kernel sizes. Supernet defines the largest network we can search.,"Figure 6 depicts our building block structure. This block starts and ends with 1×1 convolution, with N searchable superkernels in the middle. Each searchable superkernel is designed similarly to Eq. (3), while we may use different threshold values in each superkernel. The kernel sizes and expansion ratios are selected among predetermined values. If the j-th searchable superkernel chooses an expansion ratio e_{j}, the j-th kernel has e_{j} times more channels than the first 1×1 convolution. Compared with the original MixConv suggested in (Tan and Le, 2019b), the proposed building block supports more diverse combinations of kernel sizes and expansion ratios. It enhances the efficiency of search results on our target NPU (Table 5). A superkernel has two parameters to search: expansion ratio and kernel size. To limit the search space, we choose the expansion ratio among 0, 2, 4, and 6, and the kernel size between 3 and 5 when MBConv or full convolution is used as the building block. In the case of the MixConv-based building block, we use N=3 superkenels whose expansion ratio is 0 or 2; The sum of the expansion ratio of three superkernels has the same range as the expansion ratio of a single MBConv block. To allow three superkernels to have different kernel sizes, we let one of three superkernels be able to have 7 as the kernel size. A NAS technique explores a predefined search space and estimates the performance for each candidate architecture to find an optimal one with the highest accuracy under a given latency constraint. Thus there are three factors that affect the performance of NAS, as shown in Figure 1: search space, search strategy, and performance estimation. The search space of a NAS technique is usually restricted by a supernet that defines the topology of the largest network to explore. Since the performance of a network depends on the hardware platform, the NAS technique needs to be customized to a given hardware platform. While numerous NAS techniques have been proposed with various search strategies recently, their assumed hardware platforms are mostly GPUs. In this paper, we present a customized NAS technique for an NPU, which produces a CNN architecture with a better accuracy-latency tradeoff than existing models."
Why did the authors choose MIDAP as the target NPU to experiment on?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

The harmonic similarity to human music is directly connected to the structuredness of chord patterns. Well-structured chord patterns, like those found in human-composed music, tend to have higher harmonic similarity to human music, while less structured patterns tend to have lower harmonic similarity","The end-to-end latency can be estimated quite accurately, and MIDAP can efficiently support which which lower the MAC utilization in other NPUs.","Even though the proposed methodology can be applied to any type of NPU, the current implementation is made for an adder-tree type NPU, called MIDAP (Kanget al., 2019).It has a fully-pipelined micro-architecture that consists of separate hardware modules and memory modules for convolution, activation function, and various reduction operations.

How does the authors select SE blocks to remove?,"The performance of the residual network is compared using the following metrics:

* Top-1 error
* Top-5 error
* Test error
* FLOPs (float-point operations per second)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the residual network and compare it to other models, such as ResNet, Inception, and ResNeXt","Removing SE blocks having similar distributions over different image classes are known to incur only a marginal loss in accuracy. Thus, for each channel c, authors calculated the standard deviation \sigma_{c} of activation values over different images. Small value of \sigma_{c} would mean that SE block is having similar distrubution over different images. Thus they defined the metric as the average of \sigma_{c} over all channels. Specifically, they sample from 10K images from the training dataset, and remove until only about 60% of blocks are remained.","Figure 11 depicts an example distribution of activation values produced by two different SE blocks for three different images.

Thus, after training, they obtained averaged activation values of a SE block over multiple images in the same class.They compared the distributions of the averaged values over different image classes. They observed that removing the SE blocks that have similar distributions over different image classes incurs only a marginal loss in accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose to remove SE blocks selectively to minimize the additional computation cost caused by SE blocks.We obtain activation values from a SE block for each input image and measure how the distribution of activation values varies over different input images.For each channel c, we calculate the standard deviation \sigma_{c} of activation values over different images. If \sigma_{c} is small in most channels, the activation values from the SE block does not differ much over images. Conceptually, it implies that the SE block does not help to discriminate further which channel is more influential. From the engineering perspective, it means that channel-wise multiplication of a SE block is similar to constant multiplication, which can be handled by the following convolutional layer. We define a metric as the average of standard deviation values \sigma_{c} over all channels that represent the diverseness of the activation distribution over different images. If the metric value is small, we remove the SE block. For example, in Figure 11, our metric of the SE block on the left side has a value of 0.021, while the right side has a value of 0.118, more than 5x larger than the left side; The left side is a better candidate for SE block removal. When we remove SE blocks according to this metric, the accuracy is found to be similar, while the latency got shorter (Table 6). Finally, we selectively removed SE blocks from ours-XL+, resulting in ours-XL-rmSE+. We collected the activation values using randomly sampled 10K images from the training dataset and calculated the metric explained in Sec. 4.3.3.After removing SE blocks from ours-XL+ based on the metric, only about 60% of the blocks in the network have SE blocks.

"How does authors verify that searching in a small supernet then scaling is good tactic to search a big network?
",Limited,"Searching in a small supernet then scaling was better than directly searching in a big supernet; The accuracy was similar, but the direct search needed much higher search cost.","There are two methods to find an architecture with a loose latency constraint. One is to use compound scaling that scales a small network with shorter latency, and the other is to search a network directly. To compare these two methods,we first scaled ours-M using the same scaling coefficients that we used to scale ours-M+ to ours-L+ and trained it. When conducting a direct search, we scaled the depth and width of the supernet and the input image size first and applied the proposed NAS technique for the scaled supernet. We used batch size 512 instead of 1024 during the architecture search due to the memory limitation of TPU. The comparison result is shown in Table 7 in terms of top-1 accuracy(%) and the latency on the target NPU(ms).Two results were similar while direct search needed 10 hours on TPUv3; It means that compound scaling is an effective method to find a large network fast."
Why does author experiment the quantized linear supernet design even though Radosavovic et al. already provided similar result?,Overfitting due to the direct optimization of MI terms,"The previous study shows the linear design is beneficial in terms of computational complexity, while the author shows the result in terms of latency.","Thus, we place more blocks to stages with larger width in the supernet, making the cumulative depth up to a specific stage is proportional to the width of the stage, which is similar to PyramidNet (Han et al., 2017). A recent study (Radosavovic et al., 2020) also claims that neural architectures with a linear relationship between the cumulative depth and the width tend to have higher accuracy with a similar amount of computation complexity. Our experiment shows that our modification to supernet enhances the efficiency of the search result in terms of accuracy as well as latency (Table 4)."

As a result, we could make the latency shorter, while the accuracy was slightly improved than ours-XL+. This model achieves 82.72% top-1 accuracy with only 11.66ms latency.It is much better than EfficientNet-EdgeTPU-L (Gupta and Akin, 2020) that achieves 80.62% FP32 top-1 accuracy with more than 20ms on EdgeTPU. Our architecture on MIDAP is about 2 times faster with 2.1% higher accuracy."
Is the extended search strategy beneficial? Does the gain simply come from modified search space?,"The trade-off between fidelity and diversity varies smoothly with the Gradient Scale, with higher scales trading off recall (diversity) for higher precision and IS (fidelity)",The randomly searched network on the same supernet could not outperform the proposed result with Single-Path NAS. Thus the search strategy was beneficial.,"While most NAS techniques are not compared with a random search method, the authors (Li and Talwalkar, 2019) reported that a random search method is highly competitive. So we conducted an experiment to compare the proposed NAS technique with two random search methods, exploring the same search space defined by the supernet structure of ours-M.First, we designed a simple random search method that has the similar time complexity of the proposed technique. In this method, we randomly generate 15 models having a similar latency with ours-M, from the same search space. Then we train each of them for 1 epoch with cosine learning rate decay. After evaluating each of them, we choose the architecture with the topmost top-1 accuracy and fully train it. In the second method, called random selection, we randomly generate 20 models having a similar latency with ours-M and train them fully and take the architecture with the highest top-1 accuracy. Since the random selection method performs search and training simultaneously, it is slower than the proposed technique by the number of randomly generated models. Comparison results are reported in Table 6. It is confirmed that both random selection and random search are quite competitive, but noticeably inferior to ours-M in terms of accuracy.In detail, the worst case of random selection showed 0.8% lower accuracy than ours-M. The best performance obtained from 20 randomly generated models is 79.19%, still lower than the accuracy of ours-M.Note that random search and random selection show similar performance that is no smaller than the other networks. It means that the search space defined by the supernet architecture has a more significant effect on the accuracy than the search method."
"How the proposed loss function is different from that of original Single-Path NAS?
","An anisotropic probing kernel is a type of neural network kernel that is elongated in certain directions, allowing it to capture long-range interactions in the input data","Previous method needs additional search cost for hyperparameter, since they have no information for target latency. The author's method directly includes the target latency, resulting in ease of search process.","The existing hardware-aware differentiable NAS methods mostly define some hyperparameters to balance between accuracy and latency, including SinglePath NAS, whose loss function is defined as Eq. (6). Since there is no information on the target latency in the loss function, in case there is a strict latency constraint, they have to pay additional search costs for the hyperparameters to let the final architecture have no larger latency than the constraint. In addition, this process needs to be repeated whenever the target latency is changed. In this work, we propose a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology extending the Single-Path NAS technique (Stamoulis et al., 2019). We modify the supernet architecture by varying the number of blocks in stages and adding mixed depthwise convolution (Tan and Le, 2019b) to the search space. By modifying the loss function to directly include the target latency estimated by a cycle-accurate simulator of the target NPU, we could find a better baseline architecture with a shorter latency than the latency constraint. Using a tight latency constraint, we can reduce the search space to find the baseline network fast. Afterward, we apply compound scaling to find a larger network than the baseline network, and add SE blocks and h-swish activation functions in the post-processing step.Through the proposed NAS methodology, we could obtain a network with 82.72% accuracy with 11.66ms latency on our target NPU, without special data augmentation in training. It dominates the existing network models on the target NPU. It confirms the importance of supernet architecture design for a given NPU and effectiveness of the three-step approach in the proposed NAS methodology: supernet design, SinglePath NAS with a tighter latency constraint, and compound scaling and post-processing. Although this is not a panacea, this modification significantly eases the search process, which will be discussed in section 5.2 with various experiments."
"Why authors choose to extend Single-Path NAS as the search strategy, instead of famous NAS methods such as MNASNet?","Image-to-image translation tasks, such as converting grayscale images to color images, semantic segmentation, and artistic stylization",The author's aim is building a fast NAS methodology. Single-Path NAS could search a good architecture faster than existing NAS techniques. It builds a faster NAS technique by reducing the number of trainable parameters. Another reason is that Single-Path NAS can be efficiently extended to support MixConv.,"Among diverse techniques to decrease the search cost, Single-Path NAS (Stamoulis et al., 2019) was recently proposed to find a good architecture faster than the existing differentiable NAS techniques. This technique is extended to broaden the search space by including the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block in the search space (Stamoulis et al., 2020). Our work is grounded on the original Single-Path NAS technique. Differentiable NAS methods usually define architecture parameters to choose which convolution layer to use in the block, training each convolution layer independently. Single-Path NAS (Stamoulis et al., 2019) reduce the search cost by decreasing the number of trainable parameters by sharing the kernel weights between convolution layers.The key idea is designing an over-parameterized depthwise convolution kernel named superkernel, and letting each depthwise convolution kernel of candidate MBConvs directly inherit the weights of this superkernel. We finish this subsection by highlighting the merit of Single-Path NAS on building a MixConv-based differentiable NAS. Conventional multi-path NAS methods would have difficulties when adding inverted bottleneck convolution with MixConv to their search space. Since the number of possible choices of such blocks grows proportionally to the partition number, multi-path NAS methods would introduce a significant increase in memory requirements and the search time. On the contrary, MixConv can be efficiently supported in Single-Path NAS, as explained below. Since an NPU is much faster than a GPU, it enables us to explore the wider search space for NAS under a given latency constraint. Since there are many factors to define the search space, such as the number of layers, channels, kernel sizes, and so on, the search space grows exponentially as the allowed computation complexity grows. Hence, reducing the search space, as well as the search time, is very challenging for NPU-aware NAS techniques. While the aforementioned work for Google’s Edge TPU trains each architecture candidate from scratch to estimate the performance, it is not computationally efficient. In contrast, we adopt a fast differentiable hardware-aware One-Shot NAS, called Single-Path NAS (Stamoulis et al., 2019), in order to reduce the search time. In this work, we propose a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology extending the Single-Path NAS technique (Stamoulis et al., 2019). We modify the supernet architecture by varying the number of blocks in stages and adding mixed depthwise convolution (Tan and Le, 2019b) to the search space. By modifying the loss function to directly include the target latency estimated by a cycle-accurate simulator of the target NPU, we could find a better baseline architecture with a shorter latency than the latency constraint.

How does equation 2 let the supernet search kernel size?,"Running information on resource-constrained environments is important because many mobile and embedded devices, despite the increasing prevalence of GPUs, still have limited computing resources, making it challenging to deploy state-of-the-art neural networks","They define a trainable threshold value t, and compare the norm of the kernel weights with the threshold, to determine the kernel size.","Let \mathbf{w}_{k,e} denote the depthwise convolution kernel of candidate MBConv with kernel size k and expansion ratio e (MBConv{}_{k,e}). First, they introduce a large \mathbf{w}_{5,6}, which is the DWConv kernel of MBConv{}_{5,6}. Then, the inner core of \mathbf{w}_{5,6} can be considered as \mathbf{w}_{3,6}, a DWConv kernel of MBConv{}_{3,6}.A superkernel containing these two kernel size options can be expressed as Figure 4:(1)\mathbf{w}_{*,6}=\mathbf{w}_{3,6}+\mathbbm{1}(\rm{use\leavevmode\nobreak\ kernel\leavevmode\nobreak\ size\leavevmode\nobreak\ 5})\cdot\mathbf{w}_{5\backslash 3,6}where \mathbf{w}_{5\backslash 3,e} means the outer part, \mathbf{w}_{5,e}-\mathbf{w}_{3,e}.Next, they formulate conditions to determine the kernel size. They define a certain threshold value t and compare the norm of the kernel weights with the threshold. If the norm of a subset weight is larger than the threshold, it remains in the supernet. To this end, Eq. (1) is changed as follows:(2)\mathbf{w}_{*,6}(t_{k=5})=\mathbf{w}_{3,6}+\mathbbm{1}(\lVert\mathbf{w}_{5\backslash 3,6}\rVert^{2}>t_{k=5})\cdot\mathbf{w}_{5\backslash 3,6} The threshold value is also trainable to be automatically chosen during training. To enable back-propagation, they relax 1(x > t) to σ(x − t) when computing gradients. In addition, they optimize kernel weights and threshold values simultaneously. For a given tight search time, this method is shown to be more effective than the other methods [29]."
What is 'cumulative depth up to a specific stage' ?,"Instance segmentation is a computer vision task that involves correctly detecting and precisely segmenting each individual object instance in an image, combining elements of object detection and semantic segmentation",The total number of blocks starting from the very first bloci in the network up to the last block in a specific stage.,"In this section, we will briefly review the Single-Path NAS technique and our target NPU.Before going further, we define some terminologies used in this paper, as shown in Figure 3. A neural architecture consists of stages at the top level. A stage consists of a sequence of blocks whose output feature maps have the same dimension. In the proposed supernet, a block is defined as MBConv that typically starts with 1×1 conv (expansion layer) and ends with 1×1 conv. Adopting the MixConv approach, the depthwise convolution layer consists of parallel superkernels whose kernel size will be determined during the NAS process. The width of block denotes the number of channels in the final output feature map of the block, and the width of stage is the width of the final block in the stage. We will call the total number of blocks starting from the very first block in the network up to the last block in a specific stage S, as the cumulative depth up to stage S."
How does the authors verify adding h-swish and SE is beneficial?,"The author can claim that only using absolute positional encoding with the Transformer can exhibit a too relaxed structural inductive bias because distance or Laplacian-based positional representations do not provide a measure of structural similarity between nodes, especially in the inductive case where two nodes are from different graphs","Previous works showed that using swish activation function instead of ReLU showed better accuracy, and h-swish shows similar impact on accuracy. The authors verify that replacing ReLU with h-swish and adding SE improves the accuracy by around 1%.","Extensive studies have been conducted to find a better activation function than ReLU, and the swish activation function (Ramachandranet al., 2017) was found. Several neural networks (Tan and Le, 2019b; Mei et al., 2019; Tan and Le, 2019a) use swish activation function instead of ReLU to improve accuracy. Howard et al. (Howard et al., 2019) proposed a quantization-friendly version of the swish activation function called h-swish that has a similar impact on accuracy. So, we replace ReLU with h-swish (Howard et al., 2019) activation function. We improve the baseline network by adding the h-swish activation function and squeeze-and-excitation(SE) block to get the ours-M+ model. Figure 12 shows the topology of ours-M+ architecture in which the height of each block is proportional to the expansion ratio of the block. Compared with the baseline network, ours-M, we achieve around 1% accuracy boost with ours-M+, paying the cost of 16% latency increase. This model outperforms the other models, 0.5% higher accuracy and 14% faster than EfficientNet-B2. Since EfficientNet-B2 is too large to run with the default configuration on MIDAP, we increase the memory size for filter weights.  To examine how SE and h-swish impact accuracy individually, we compare four combinations as displayed in Table 8. The baseline is ours-M that does not use SE and h-swish activation function. Replacing ReLU with h-swish gives a marginal improvement on accuracy while adding SE blocks improves the accuracy noticeably. Adding both SE and h-swish activation function improves the accuracy by around 1%. For accurate latency estimation, an analytical latency estimator is devised, based on a cycle-level NPU simulator that runs an entire CNN considering the memory access overhead accurately.Since the NPU assumed in this paper can execute depth-wise separable convolution (DWConv), squeeze-and-excitation (SE), and h-swish activation function efficiently, the proposed supernet prefers DWConv to regular convolution. Observing that the accuracy is improved by around 1% if SE and h-swish activation function are used, we add a post-processing phase after a CNN network is found by NAS to add SE layers and to replace ReLU to h-swish activation function."
What happens if author removes the linear supernet design and opt to use the covnentional supernet design?,"fANOVA is performed by marginalizing over dimensions efficiently in regression trees, allowing for predicting the marginal error for one hyperparameter while averaging over all the others, without requiring a full hyperparameter grid search","Using the conventional, constant depth method would drop the accuracy.","As shown in Table 4, a supernet with linear depth outperforms a supernet with constant depth in terms of accuracy with similar latency. It confirms that this simple change of block assignment in supernet gives notable accuracy boost with the same latency constraint, without any additional optimization techniques. The number of blocks is one of the key parameters in this structure. Some recent studies [23, 24] report that the way of assigning the number of blocks in each stage has a noticeable impact on the accuracy, even with the same number of blocks in total. However, in conventional One-Shot NAS methods, each stage in the supernet has the same number of blocks [8, 17, 18, 22]."
How can rely on this latency prediction model?,The authors ensured fair comparison between the 9 variants of LSTMs they analyzed by individually tuning the hyperparameters for each variant and using random search to obtain good-performing hyperparameters for every combination of variant and dataset,The latency of randomly generated models shows that the latency model is accurate.,"Figure 9 shows the estimated latency and simulated latency of randomly generated 100 models on our search space. It validates the accuracy of the proposed latency model, whose mean absolute percentage error(MAPE) is about 0.16%."
What is the difference between Siamese Network and our works?,"CTC-training is a method of training speech recognizers using the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) algorithm, which is an extension of the RNNTransducer model",Learned distance from Siamese network can be used to solve one-shot problems.

In this model,the learning is reduced to learning image embeddings \phi(x_{i}) whoseeuclidean metric is consistent with the label similarities. Since then, great progress has been done in one-shot learning. Koch et al. (2015) presented a deep-learning model based on computing the pair-wise distance between samples using Siamese Networks, then, this learned distance can be used to solve one-shot problems by k-nearest neighbors classification.

Snell et al. (2017) extended the work from Vinyals et al. (2016), by using euclidean distance instead of cosine which provided significant improvements, they also build a prototype representation of each class for the few-shot learning scenario.

Therefore, zero-shot learning is learning from no real example.","One such instance is the ability to learn from few examples, in the so-called few-shot learning tasks.Rather than relying on regularization to compensate for the lack of data, researchers have exploredways to leverage a distribution of similar tasks, inspired by human learning Lake et al.

Few-shot learning and semi-supervised learning is the same term. Is this true?,"Not necessarily.

"Does previous researches, which paper mentioned, using GNN?","Encoding noise and the likelihood distribution play a crucial role in shaping the representations learned by VAEs.

Matching network uses BERT. Is this true?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

No.

In the context of the report, the author mentions that the Inception-ResNet variants were chosen in an ad hoc manner with the main constraint being that the parameters and computational complexity of the models should be similar to the cost of the non-residual models. This suggests that the computational complexity of the models was not the only factor considered when choosing the Inception-ResNet variants, and therefore, the computational complexity of a 7x7 convolution may not be directly comparable to that of two 7x1 and 1x7 convolutions","It's not true. Matching network uses attention mechanism, not BERT.","Matching networks Vinyals et al. (2016) use a set representation for the ensemble of images in \mathcal{T},similarly as our proposed graph neural network model, but with two important differences.First, the attention mechanism considered in this set representationis akin to the edge feature learning, with the difference that the mechanism attends always to the same node embeddings, as opposed to our stacked adjacency learning, which is closer to Vaswani et al. (2017). In other words, instead of the attention kernel in (3),matching networks consider attention mechanisms of the form \tilde{A}_{*,j}^{(k)}=\varphi({\bf x}_{*}^{(k)},{\bf x}_{j}^{(T)}),where {\bf x}_{j}^{(T)} is the encoding function for the elements of the support set, obtained with bidirectional LSTMs. In that case, the support set encoding is thus computed independently of the target image.Second, the label and image fields are treated separately throughout the model, with a final step that aggregates linearly the labels using a trained kernel. This may prevent the model to leverage complex dependencies between labels and images at intermediate stages."

"What exactly is ""smoothing"" and how does it help count-based LMs account for unseen sequences?","The authors mean that the RoI layer was added in a way that deviates from the natural progression of the network's architecture, specifically by inserting it between two sets of convolutional layers",The paper does not discuss what smoothing is or how it helps some LMs account for unseen sequences.,"Language Modeling (LM) has been a central task in NLP. The goal of LM is to learn a probability distribution over sequences of symbols pertaining to a language. Much work has been done on both parametric (e.g., log-linear models) and non-parametric approaches (e.g., count-based LMs). Count-based approaches (based on statistics of N-grams) typically add smoothing which account for unseen (yet possible) sequences, and have been quite successful. To this extent, Kneser-Ney smoothed 5-gram models (Kneser & Ney, 1995) are a fairly strong baseline which, for large amounts of training data, have challenged other parametric approaches based on Neural Networks (Bengio et al., 2006)."
"What is a ""recurrent state space""?",To optimize the domain classification of both real and fake images separately,Paper does not discuss what a recurrent state space is.,"A crucial aspect which we discuss in detail in later sections is the size of our models. Despite the large number of parameters, we try to minimize computation as much as possible by adopting a strategy proposed in (Sak et al., 2014) of projecting a relatively big recurrent state space down so that the matrices involved remain relatively small, yet the model has large memory capacity. Unsurprisingly, size matters: when training on a very large and complex data set, fitting the training data with an LSTM is fairly challenging. Thus, the size of the LSTM layer is a very important factor that influences the results, as seen in Table 1. The best models are the largest we were able to fit into a GPU memory. Our largest model was a 2-layer LSTM with 8192+1024 dimensional recurrent state in each of the layers. Increasing the embedding and projection size also helps but causes a large increase in the number of parameters, which is less desirable. Lastly, training an RNN instead of an LSTM yields poorer results (about 5 perplexity worse) for a comparable model size."
What is the difference between a 1-d CNN and a 2-layer highway network?,MNIST,The paper does not discuss the difference between 1D CNN and highway networks.,"In (Kim et al., 2015), the words characters are processed by a 1-d CNN (Le Cun et al., 1990) with max-pooling across the sequence for each convolutional feature. The resulting features are fed to a 2-layer highway network (Srivastava et al., 2015b), which allows the embedding to learn semantic representations. The model was evaluated on small-scale language modeling experiments for various languages and matched the best results on the PTB data set despite having 60% fewer parameters."
What is a 128-dim correction?,"By aligning the bottom decoder layer to the top encoder layer, parallelism in the decoder network can be removed, and the model would not benefit from using more than one GPU for decoding",It is a means of improvement over words that have different meaning but are spelled similarly.,"z_{w}=h^{T}CNN(chars_{w})+h^{T}Mcorr_{w}where M is a matrix projecting a low-dimensional embedding vector corr_{w} back up to the dimensionality of the projected LSTM hidden state of h. This amounts to adding a bottleneck linear layer, and brings the CNN Softmax much closer to our best result, as can be seen in Table 1, where adding a 128-dim correction halves the gap between regular and the CNN Softmax. As described in Section 3.2, adding a “correction” word embedding term alleviates the gap between regular and CNN Softmax. Indeed, we can trade-off model size versus perplexity. For instance, by adding 100M weights (through a 128 dimensional bottleneck embedding) we achieve 35.8 perplexity (see Table 1)."
What is dropout and how does it alleviate overfitting?,"Yes. The paper shows how each component of KERM contributes to passage re-ranking performance through ablation studies, which demonstrate the importance of both knowledge interaction and propagation processes, as well as the effectiveness of knowledge graph distillation in improving performance",Dropout is a neural network component parametrized with a probability. The paper does not discuss how it alleviates overfitting.,"Following (Zaremba et al., 2014) we use dropout (Srivastava, 2013) before and after every LSTM layer. The biases of LSTM forget gate were initialized to 1.0 (Jozefowicz et al., 2015). The size of the models will be described in more detail in the following sections, and the choices of hyper-parameters will be released as open source upon publication. As shown in Table 1, using dropout improves the results. To our surprise, even relatively small models (e.g., single layer LSTM with 2048 units projected to 512 dimensional outputs) can over-fit the training set if trained long enough, eventually yielding holdout set degradation. Using dropout on non-recurrent connections largely mitigates these issues. While over-fitting still occurs, there is no more need for early stopping. For models that had 4096 or less units in the LSTM layer, we used 10% dropout probability. For larger models, 25% was significantly better. Even with such regularization, perplexities on the training set can be as much as 6 points below test."
How does IS and NCE compare in terms of model performance? ,DPM is trained with fully supervised learning,IS performs better.,"p(Y=k|W)\propto_{Y}\frac{p_{d}(w_{k})}{p_{n}(w_{k})}and, following a similar argument than for NCE, if we define p(Y=k|W)=softmax(s_{\theta}(w_{k})-\log p_{n}(w_{k})) then p^{\prime}(w)=softmax(s_{\theta}(w,h)) is a good approximation of p_{d}(word). Note that the only difference between NCE and IS is that, in NCE, we define a binary classification task between true or noise words with a logistic loss, whereas in IS we define a multiclass classification problem with a Softmax and cross entropy loss. We hope that our derivation helps clarify the similarities and differences between the two. In particular, we observe that IS, as it optimizes a multiclass classification task (in contrast to solving a binary task), may be a better choice. Indeed, the updates to the logits with IS are tied whereas in NCE they are independent. Table 3 shows the test perplexities of NCE vs IS loss after a few epochs of 2048 unit LSTM with 512 projection. The IS objective significantly improves the speed and the overall performance of the model when compared to NCE."
Why doesn't character-level embeddings degrade performance compared to word-level embeddings? ,"The value of 0.5 is set as the watermark probability threshold for filtering out NSFW images and toxic words in the text.

The authors set the value as 0.5 because it is a common practice in NLP and computer vision to use a fixed threshold value to filter out unwanted content. The value of 0.5 was chosen based on the authors' experimentation and evaluation of the model's performance on a validation set",The paper discusses one advantage of character-level embeddings over word-level embeddings. There is no comprehensive discussion on why the resulting performance does not degrade.,"The character-level features allow for a smoother and compact parametrization of the word embeddings. Recent efforts on small scale language modeling have used CNN character embeddings for the input embeddings (Kim et al., 2015). Although not as straightforward, we propose an extension to this idea to also reduce the number of parameters of the Softmax layer. Recall from Section 2.3 that the Softmax computes a logit as z_{w}=h^{T}e_{w} where h is a context vector and e_{w} the word embedding. Instead of building a matrix of |V|\times|h| (whose rows correspond to e_{w}), we produce e_{w} with a CNN over the characters of w as e_{w}=CNN(chars_{w}) – we call this a CNN Softmax. We used the same network architecture to dynamically generate the Softmax word embeddings without sharing the parameters with the input word-embedding sub-network. For inference, the vectors e_{w} can be precomputed, so there is no computational complexity increase w.r.t. the regular Softmax."
How does maximizing log-likelihood lead to optimizing cross-entropy between target probability distribution and the model prediction?,"No.

The model cannot choose the embedding function to be zero to overcome the small distance issue during triplet selection, as the embedding function is learned during training and is not a parameter that can be set to zero. Additionally, setting the embedding function to zero would not help the model overcome the issue of collapsed models, as it would still result in a model with poor generalization performance",The paper does not discuss the detailed workings of the established relation.,"Assigning probability distributions over large vocabularies is computationally challenging. For modeling language, maximizing log-likelihood of a given word sequence leads to optimizing cross-entropy between the target probability distribution (e.g., the target word we should be predicting), and our model predictions p. Generally, predictions come from a linear layer followed by a Softmax non-linearity: p(w)=\frac{\exp(z_{w})}{\sum_{w^{\prime}\in V}\exp(z_{w^{\prime}})} where z_{w} is the logit corresponding to a word w. The logit is generally computed as an inner product z_{w}=h^{T}e_{w} where h is a context vector and e_{w} is a “word embedding” for w."
How does increasing the embedding and projection size help with respect to the model? ,"NO. While the authors do present qualitative evaluations of their proposed model through visual comparisons and human evaluations, they also perform quantitative evaluations using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and a facial expression classifier",The paper does not discuss how the positive effects are brought about.,"Unsurprisingly, size matters: when training on a very large and complex data set, fitting the training data with an LSTM is fairly challenging. Thus, the size of the LSTM layer is a very important factor that influences the results, as seen in Table 1. The best models are the largest we were able to fit into a GPU memory. Our largest model was a 2-layer LSTM with 8192+1024 dimensional recurrent state in each of the layers. Increasing the embedding and projection size also helps but causes a large increase in the number of parameters, which is less desirable. Lastly, training an RNN instead of an LSTM yields poorer results (about 5 perplexity worse) for a comparable model size."

Give one example Relation Extraction question and its answer.,"Sure! Here's the answer to the question based on the provided context:

The authors did not test baselines that were not fine-tuned but had few-shot examples because the instruction style and formatting differences between the training and evaluation sets were already providing a significant performance boost, making it unlikely that additional gains would be achieved through few-shot examples alone","Relation Extraction(RE) task is task of finding relationship between two entities.

Author said that they achieved to make SOTA RE models. Give an evidences for this statement.,"approximately 100,000 sets of candidate object locations","Their improved RE baseline achieved SOTA performance on the RE-TACRED dataset with f1 score of 91.1%. Moreover, Using RoBERTa Liu et al. (2019) as the backbone, they improved baseline model on TACRED and TACREV with f1 score 74.6% and 83.2%, respectively. The RoBERTa model achieves 1.9% higher f1 score than the SOTA model LUKE Yamada et al.","We first provide an analysis on different entity representation techniques. In this analysis, we use the base and large versions of BERT Devlin et al. (2019) and the large version of RoBERTa Liu et al. (2019) as the encoder.Table 1 shows the performance of the PLMs incorporated with different entity representation techniques.For each technique, we also provide an example of the processed text.We have several observations from the results.First, the typed entity marker and its variants outperform untyped entity representation techniques by a notable margin.Especially, the RoBERTa model achieves an F_{1} score of 74.6\% using the typed entity marker (punct), which is significantly higher than the SOTA result of 72.7\% by LUKE Yamada et al.

Entity marker and entity mask are same terms. Is this true?,Yes,"It's not true. Two term has different meaning. Entity marker is the teqnique introduces special tokens pairs to enclose the object and subject entities, whereas entity mask is the teqnique introduces new special tokens to mask the object or object entities.","•Entity mask Zhang et al. (2017). This technique introduces new special tokens [SUBJ-TYPE] or [OBJ-TYPE] to mask the subject or object entities in the original text, where TYPE is substituted with the respective entity type.This technique was originally proposed in the PA-LSTM model Zhang et al. (2017), and was later adopted by PLMs such as SpanBERT Joshi et al. (2020).Zhang et al.

(2020); Zhou et al. (2021). This technique is a variant of the previous technique that encloses entity spans using punctuation.It modifies the input text to “@ subj @ … # obj #”. The main difference from the previous technique is that this one does not introduce new special tokens into the model’s reserved vocabulary.•Typed entity marker Zhong and Chen (2021). This technique further incorporates the NER types into entity markers.It introduces new special tokens \langleS:TYPE\rangle, \langle/S:TYPE\rangle, \langleO:TYPE\rangle, \langle/O:TYPE\rangle, where TYPE is the corresponding NER type given by a named entity tagger. The input text is accordingly modified to “\langleS:TYPE\rangle subj \langle/S:TYPE\rangle … \langleO:TYPE\rangle obj \langle/O:TYPE\rangle”.•Typed entity marker (punct). We propose a variant of the typed entity marker technique that marks the entity span and entity types without introducing new special tokens.This is to enclose the subject and object entities with “@” and “#”, respectively.We also represent the subject and object entity types using their label text, which is prepended to the entity spans and is enclosed by “*” for subjects or “\wedge” for objects.The modified text is “@ * subj-type * subj @ … # \wedge obj-type \wedge obj # ”, where subj-type and obj-type is the label text of NER types."
BLINK is Scalable. Is this true?,Yes,"The paper shows the scalability of the proposed simple two-stage method with the experiments conducted on the zero-shot entity-linking dataset where external entity knowledge is not available, which enables the model to be used on various entity linking tasks that contain millions of possible entities to consider. The state-of-the-art result and the extensive evaluation of the accuracy-speed trade-off support that the proposed method is efficient and scalable.","Scale is a key challenge for entity linking; there are millions of possible entities to consider for each mention. To efficiently filter or rank the candidates, existing methods use different sources of external information, including manually curated mention tables Ganea and Hofmann (2017), incoming Wikipedia link popularity Yamada et al. (2016), and gold Wikipedia entity categories Gillick et al. (2019). In this paper, we show that BERT-based models set new state-of-the-art performance levels for large scale entity linking when used in a zero shot setup, where there is no external knowledge and a short text description provides the only information we have for each entity. We also present an extensive evaluation of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent to large pre-trained models, and show is possible to achieve very efficient linking with modest loss of accuracy. More specifically, we introduce a two stage approach for zero-shot linking (see Figure 1 for an overview), based on fine-tuned BERT architectures Devlin et al. (2019). In the first stage, we do retrieval in a dense space defined by a bi-encoder that independently embeds the mention context and the entity descriptions Humeau et al. (2019); Gillick et al. (2019).Each retrieved candidate is then examined more carefully with a cross-encoder that concatenates the mention and entity text, following Logeswaran et al. (2019). This overall approach is conceptually simple but highly effective, as we show through detailed experiments. We proposed a conceptually simple, scalable, and highly effective two stage approach for entity linking. We show that our BERT-based model outperforms IR methods for entity retrieval, and achieved new state-of-the-art results on recently introduced zero-shot entity linking dataset, WikilinksNED Unseen-Mentions dataset, and the more established TACKBP-2010 benchmark, without any task-specific heuristics or external entity knowledge. We present evaluations of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent to large pre-trained models, and show that it is possible to achieve efficient linking with modest loss of accuracy.Finally, we show that knowledge distillation can further improve bi-encoder model performance.Future work includes:•Enriching entity representations by adding entity type and entity graph information;•Modeling coherence by jointly resolving mentions in a document;•Extending our work to other languages and other domains;•Joint models for mention detection and entity linking."
"BLINK have two different versions, bi-encoding version and cross-encoding version. Is this true?","Sure! Here's my answer:

Overfitting refers to a model that is too complex and learns the noise in the training data, rather than the underlying patterns","BLINK model is a two-stage method using two encoders: bi-encoder and cross-encoder. With the qualitative analysis, the authors compared the BLINK with its bi-encoding version which uses a bi-encoder for candidate ranking instead of a cross-encoder, and showed that the cross-encoding version utilizing context information better than the bi-encoding version. Therefore we can say that BLINK has two different versions.","As expected, the cross-encoder performs better than the bi-encoder on ranking. However, both models exceed state-of-the-art performance levels, demonstrating that the overall approach is highly effective. We observe that our model also performs well when we change the underlying Knowledgebase to full Wikipedia, and even without fine-tuning on the dataset. In Table 5 we show that our bi-encoder model is highly effective at retrieving relevant entities, where the underlying Knowledgebase is full Wikipedia. In the first example, we see that the bi-encoder mistakenly links “Ronaldo” to the Brazilian football player, while the cross-encoder is able to use context word “Juventus” to disambiguate. In the second example, the cross-encoder is able to identify from context that the sentence is describing art instead of fiction, where the bi-encoder failed. In the third example, the bi-encoder is able to find the correct entity “Ancient Greek,”; where the cross-encoder mistakenly links it to the entity “Ancient Greek philosophy,” likely because that the word “philosophers” is in context. We observe that cross-encoder is often better at utilizing context information than bi-encoder, but can sometimes make mistakes because of misleading context cues. Figure 1 shows our overall approach. The bi-encoder uses two independent BERT transformers to encode model context/mention and entity into dense vectors, and each entity candidate is scored as the dot product of these vectors. The candidates retrieved by the bi-encoder are then passed to the cross-encoder for ranking. The cross-encoder encodes context/mention and entity in one transformer, and applies an additional linear layer to compute the final score for each pair. After training our model on Wikipedia, we fine-tune the model on the TACKBP-2010 training dataset. We use the top 100 candidates retrieved by the bi-encoder as training examples for the cross-encoder, and chose hyper-parameters based on cross validation. We report accuracy results in Table 4. For ablation studies, we also report the following versions of our model:"
Using cross-encoder is time-consuming but accurate. Is this true?,"Using note-based representation over grid-based representations allows for more explicit and detailed modeling of chord progressions and melodic structures, rather than aggregating notes within a fixed time grid","Since the cross-encoder has large memory consumption and compute footprint, it is time-consuming and not suitable for tasks that require fast inference. However, it is relatively accurate compared to the bi-encoder, which is the reason the author utilized knowledge distillation so that they can obtain some accuracy gain from the cross-encoder. Therefore, we can say that using a cross-encoder is time-consuming but accurate.","Due to its larger memory and compute footprint, we use the cross-encoder in a re-ranking stage, over a small set (≤100)\leq 100)≤ 100 ) of candidates retrieved with the bi-encoder. The cross-encoder is not suitable for retrieval or tasks that require fast inference. Finally, we do an extensive evaluation of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent in our bi- and cross-encoder models.We show that the two stage methods scales well in a full Wikipedia setting, by linking against all the 5.9M Wikipedia entities for TACKBP-2010, while still outperforming existing model with much smaller candidate sets.We also show that bi-encoder linking is very fast with approximate nearest neighbor search (e.g. linking over 5.9 million candidates in 2 milliseconds), and that much of the accuracy gain from the more expensive cross-encoder can be transferred to the bi-encoder via knowledge distillation.We release our code and models, as well as a system to link entity mentions to all of Wikipedia (similar to TagME Ferragina and Scaiella (2011)).111Our code and models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/BLINK"
When does cross-encoder powerful? Give an example.,"Sure! Here's my answer:

To test the effectiveness of different methods for improving memory","Cross-encoder exerts its power for the cases requiring disambiguation with the given context.

Another example shows that the cross-encoder can identify that the sentence is describing gothic art instead of gothic fiction.","Table 8 presents some examples from our bi-encoder and cross-encoder model predictions, to provide intuition for how these two models consider context and mention for entity linking.

In the third example, the bi-encoder is able to find the correct entity “Ancient Greek,”; where the cross-encoder mistakenly links it to the entity “Ancient Greek philosophy,” likely because that the word “philosophers” is in context. We observe that cross-encoder is often better at utilizing context information than bi-encoder, but can sometimes make mistakes because of misleading context cues."
What TACKBP-2010 means?,"FID, Precision, Recall, and IS","TACKBP-2010 is the dataset for evaluating entity linking systems that are widely used in research in this field like ""Khalife and Vazirgiannis (2018)"" and ""Raiman and Raiman (2018)"". This dataset is made in 2010 and contains the entities in the TAC Reference Knowledge Base which contains 818,741 entities with titles, descriptions, and other meta information. This paper also used the TACKBP-2010 for fine-tuning the model. While it is likely that TACKB and 2010 are from the name of the knowledge base and when the dataset was made, it is not clear what P stands for in TACKBP-2010.","is widely used for evaluating entity linking systems Ji et al. (2010).444https://tac.nist.gov Following prior work, we measure in-KB accuracy (P@1). There are 1,074 and 1,020 annotated mention/entity pairs derived from 1,453 and 2,231 original news and web documents on training and evaluation dataset, respectively. All the entities are from the TAC Reference Knowledgebase which contains 818,741 entities with titles, descriptions and other meta info. After training our model on Wikipedia, we fine-tune the model on the TACKBP-2010 training dataset. We use the top 100 candidates retrieved by the bi-encoder as training examples for the cross-encoder, and chose hyper-parameters based on cross validation. We report accuracy results in Table 4. For ablation studies, we also report the following versions of our model:1.bi-encoder only: we use bi-encoder for candidate ranking instead of cross-encoder.2.Full Wikipedia: we use 5.9M Wikipedia articles as our entity Knowlegebase, instead of TACKBP Reference Knowledgebase.3.Full Wikipedia w/o finetune: same as above, without fine-tuning on the TACKBP-2010 training set. There are however many other cues that could potentially be added in future work. For example, Khalife and Vazirgiannis (2018) report 94.57\% precision on the TACKBP-2010 dataset. However, their method is based on the strong assumption that a gold fine-grained entity type is given for each mention (and they do not attempt to do entity type prediction). Indeed, if fine-grained entity type information is given by an oracle at test time, then Raiman and Raiman (2018) reports 98.6\% accuracy on TACKBP-2010, indicating that improving fine-grained entity type prediction would likely improve entity linking. Our results is achieved without gold fine-grained entity type information. Instead, our model learns representations of context, mention and entities based on text only."
Why author emphasized their model as “Zero-shot”?,"No, it cannot be generated by video interpolation alone. While video interpolation can be used to create smooth transitions between frames, it cannot generate new content or motion consistent with the text prompt. Make-A-Video's approach combines spatial and spatiotemporal super-resolution networks, frame interpolation, and prior knowledge to generate high-quality videos that are semantically consistent with the input text","In the zero-shot settings, the set of documents/mentions/entities from training data is not visible in test data, which means the information of the entity that should be linked at test time is not learned directly from the training set. This setting is related to scalability, which is important for the entity linking tasks since there can be lots of possible entity candidates for each mention. The proposed BERT-based models can deal with these settings and show their accuracy and efficiency in scale.","Scale is a key challenge for entity linking; there are millions of possible entities to consider for each mention. To efficiently filter or rank the candidates, existing methods use different sources of external information, including manually curated mention tables Ganea and Hofmann (2017), incoming Wikipedia link popularity Yamada et al. (2016), and gold Wikipedia entity categories Gillick et al. (2019). In this paper, we show that BERT-based models set new state-of-the-art performance levels for large scale entity linking when used in a zero shot setup, where there is no external knowledge and a short text description provides the only information we have for each entity. We also present an extensive evaluation of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent to large pre-trained models, and show is possible to achieve very efficient linking with modest loss of accuracy. Two recent results are most closely related to our work. Logeswaran et al. (2019) proposed the zero-shot entity linking task. They use cross-encoders for entity ranking, but rely on traditional IR-techniques for candidate generation and did not evaluate on large scale benchmarks such as TACKBP.Gillick et al. (2019) show that dense embeddings work well for candidate generation, but they did not do pre-training and included external category labels in their bi-encoder architectures, limiting their linking to entities in Wikipedia. Our approach can be seen as generalizing both of these lines of work, and showing for the first time that pre-trained zero-shot architectures are both highly accurate and computationally efficient at scale. We also study zero-shot entity linking Logeswaran et al. (2019). Here the document setup is the same, but the knowledge base is separated in training and test time.

The entity dictionaries cover different domains and range in size from 10K to 100K entities. We also study zero-shot entity linking Logeswaran et al. (2019).

How BLINK can achieved zero-shot linking?,"The author referred to selecting only the most difficult negative examples, or those with the highest confidence loss, for training to address the imbalance issue in object detection",The BLINK model used a two-stage approach for entity linking based on fine-tuned BERT architectures that first encode the mention context and entity text with the bi-encoder for the candidate retrieval and utilize the cross-encoder to score and rank them. These pre-trained architectures are simple yet scalable and effective for entity link tasks without the help of task-specific heuristics or external knowledge. The authors showed that BLINK can achieve state-of-the-art performance for the large-scale entity linking on the dataset with a zero-shot setup.

We also present an extensive evaluation of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent to large pre-trained models, and show is possible to achieve very efficient linking with modest loss of accuracy. More specifically, we introduce a two stage approach for zero-shot linking (see Figure 1 for an overview), based on fine-tuned BERT architectures Devlin et al. (2019). In the first stage, we do retrieval in a dense space defined by a bi-encoder that independently embeds the mention context and the entity descriptions Humeau et al. (2019); Gillick et al. (2019).Each retrieved candidate is then examined more carefully with a cross-encoder that concatenates the mention and entity text, following Logeswaran et al. (2019). This overall approach is conceptually simple but highly effective, as we show through detailed experiments. We proposed a conceptually simple, scalable, and highly effective two stage approach for entity linking. We show that our BERT-based model outperforms IR methods for entity retrieval, and achieved new state-of-the-art results on recently introduced zero-shot entity linking dataset, WikilinksNED Unseen-Mentions dataset, and the more established TACKBP-2010 benchmark, without any task-specific heuristics or external entity knowledge.

Why BLINK valuable?,"The main difference between the ""maximum frequency"" and ""exclusive frequency"" baselines is that the exclusive frequency baseline excludes the placeholder from the frequency count in the context document","The BLINK model can be said to be valuable since the model is simple yet scalable and effective compared to existing works. The proposed BERT-based model can perform entity linking with large-scale and zero-shot setups, which is crucial in real-world use cases that often contain a lot of unseen entities. BLINK also achieved a new state-of-the-art result for two zero-shot benchmarks by using only the provided text description without external knowledge, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed model.","Scale is a key challenge for entity linking; there are millions of possible entities to consider for each mention.

This paper deals with NIL.

What is maximum spanning tree problem?,"Facial expressions, speech patterns, and body language are used to judge personality traits","They lead to a maximum spanning tree problem in their global approach by proposing bidirectional connections between mentions. However, we cannot know maximum spanning tree only with this information.","To solve EL in the general case, evenwhen the first mention does not have the correct entity, we propose bidirectional connections between mentions, thus leading to a maximum spanning tree problem in our Global approach.Here we define a score for a (sub)tree t, noted as \Phi_{\mathrm{tr}}(t):\Phi_{\mathrm{tr}}(t)=\sum_{(i,j)\in t}\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(u_{i},u_{j}),(7)where u_{i} and u_{j} are two connected nodes (i.e., root, candidate entities or spans) in t.For a ground truth cluster c\in C (with C being the set of all such clusters), with its set444For a single cluster annotation, indeed it is possible that multiple correct trees can be drawn. of correct subtree representations \mathcal{T}_{c}, we model the cluster’s likelihood with its subtree scores. We minimize the negative log-likelihood \mathcal{L} of all clusters:\displaystyle\mathcal{L}\displaystyle=-\log\frac{\prod_{c\in C}\sum_{t\in\mathcal{T}_{c}}\exp\big{(}\Phi_{\mathrm{tr}}(t)\big{)}}{\sum_{t\in\mathcal{T}_{\textit{all}}}\exp\big{(}\Phi_{\mathrm{tr}}(t)\big{)}}.(8)Naively enumerating all possible spanning trees (\mathcal{T}_{\textit{all}} or \mathcal{T}_{c}) implied by this equation is infeasible, since their number is exponentially large.We use the adapted Kirchhoff’s Matrix Tree Theorem(MTT; Koo et al. (2007); Tutte (1984))to solve this:the sum of the weights of the spanning trees in a directed graph rooted in r is equal to the determinant of the Laplacian matrix of the graph with the row and column corresponding to r removed (i.e., the minor of the Laplacian with respect to r). This way, eq. (8) can be rewritten as\displaystyle\mathcal{L}\displaystyle=-\log\frac{\prod_{c\in C}{\det\Big{(}\mathbf{\hat{L}}_{c}\big{(}\mathbf{\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}}\big{)}\Big{)}}}{\det\Big{(}\mathbf{L}_{r}\big{(}\mathbf{\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}}\big{)}\Big{)}},(9)where \mathbf{\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}} is the weighted adjacency matrix of the graph, and \mathbf{L}_{r} is the minor of the Laplacian with respect to the root node r. An entry in the Laplacian matrix iscalculatedas\displaystyle\medmath{L_{i,j}=\begin{cases}\sum\limits_{k}\exp(\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(u_{k},u_{j}))&\text{if $i=j$}\\-\exp(\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(u_{i},u_{j}))&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}},(10)Similarly, \mathbf{\hat{L}}_{c} is a modified Laplacian matrix where the first row is replaced with the root r selection scores \Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(r,u_{j}).For clarity, Appendix A presents a toy example with detailed steps to calculate the loss in eq. (9)."
What is the difference between the local model and the global model?,1024x1024 pixels,Local model optimize the marginalized probability of the correct antecedents for each given span whereas global model overcomes inherent limitation by using bidirectional connections between mentions.,"Our first approach (Local in Fig. 1(a)) is motivated by current state-of-the-artcoreference resolution models(Joshi et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020)that predict a single antecedent for each span to resolve.We extend this architecture by also considering entity links as potential antecendents:in the example of Fig. 1, the mention “Alliance” can be either connected to its antecedent mention “NATO” or to any of its candidate links (Alliance or Alliance,_Ohio).While straightforward,this approach cannot solvecases where the first coreferenced mention does not include the correct entity in its candidate list(e.g., if the order of “NATO” and “Alliance” mentions in Fig. 1 would be reversed).We therefor propose a second approach, Global, which by construction overcomes this inherent limitation by using bidirectional connections between mentions.Because that implies cycles could be formed, we resort to solving a maximum spanning tree problem.Mentions that refer to the same entity form a cluster, represented as a subtree rooted by the single entity they link to.To encode the overall document’s clusters in a single spanning tree, we introduce a virtual root node(see Fig. 1(b)).222Coreference clusters without a linked entity, i.e., a NIL cluster, have a link of a mention directly to the root. We propose twomethods for joint coreference and EL.The first, Local, is motivated by end-to-end span-based coreference resolution models(Lee et al., 2017, 2018)that optimize the marginalized probability of the correct antecedents for each given span.We extend this local marginalization to include the span’s candidate entity links. Formally, themodeledprobability ofy(text span or candidate entity)being the antecedent of span s_{i} is:P_{\mathrm{cl}}(y|s_{i})=\dfrac{\exp\big{(}\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(s_{i},y)\big{)}}{\sum_{y^{\prime}\in\mathcal{Y}(s_{i})}\exp\big{(}\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(s_{i},y^{\prime})\big{)}},(2)where \mathcal{Y}(s_{i}) is the set of antecedent spans unified with the candidate entities for s_{i}. For antecedent spans \{s_{j}:j<i\} the score \Phi_{\mathrm{cl}} is defined as:\displaystyle\medmath{\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(s_{i},s_{j})=\Phi_{\mathrm{p}}(s_{i})+\Phi_{\mathrm{p}}(s_{j})+\Phi_{\mathrm{c}}(s_{i},s_{j})},(3)\displaystyle\medmath{\Phi_{\mathrm{c}}(s_{i},s_{j})=\mathrm{FFNN}_{C}([\textbf{g}_{i};\textbf{g}_{j};\textbf{g}_{i}\odot\textbf{g}_{j};\boldsymbol{\varphi}_{i,j}])},(4)where \boldsymbol{\varphi}_{i,j} is an embedding encoding the distance333Measured in number of spans, after pruning. between spans s_{i} and s_{j}.Similarly, for a particular candidate entity e_{j}, the score \Phi_{\mathrm{cl}} is:\displaystyle\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(s_{i},e_{j})=\Phi_{\mathrm{p}}(s_{i})+\Phi_{{\ell}}(s_{i},e_{j}),(5)\displaystyle\Phi_{\ell}(s_{i},e_{j})=\mathrm{FFNN}_{L}([\textbf{g}_{i};\textbf{e}_{j}]).(6)An example graph of mentions and entities with edges for which aforementioned scores \Phi_{\mathrm{cl}} would be calculated is sketched in Fig. 1(a).While simple, this approach failsto correctly solve EL when the correct entity is only present in the candidate lists of mention spans occurring later in the text (sinceearliermentions have no access to it)."

What are different types of categories in the FashionMNIST dataset?,"Through continuous servoing, the network uses the CNN to continuously update the robot's motor commands, allowing the robot to correct its own mistakes by observing the outcomes of its past actions","categories are men , women , kids and neutral.

composition: False","We use the front look thumbnail images of 70,000 unique products to build Fashion-MNIST. Those products come from different gender groups: men, women, kids and neutral.

The thumbnails (51\times 73) are then fed into the following conversion pipeline, which is visualized in Figure 1."
What is the distribution of images in the training and testing set of FashionMNIST dataset?,"Increasing the modulating factor (γ) reduces the loss contribution from easy examples and extends the range in which an example receives low loss, making it more important to correct misclassified examples","Training set has 6,000 example from each class. 

composition: False","Finally, the dataset is divided into a training and a test set. The training set receives a randomly-selected 6,000 examples from each class. Images and labels are stored in the same file format as the MNIST data set, which is designed for storing vectors and multidimensional matrices. The result files are listed in Table 1. We sort examples by their labels while storing, resulting in smaller label files after compression comparing to the MNIST. It is also easier to retrieve examples with a certain class label. The data shuffling job is therefore left to the algorithm developer."

Why is MNIST so popular?,YOLO achieves a speed of more than 150 frames per second (fps) when it pushes its mean average precision (mAP) performance to 63.4%,The popularity is related to size which allows researchers to check and prototype their model.,"The reason MNIST is so popular has to do with its size, allowing deep learning researchers to quickly check and prototype their algorithms. This is also complemented by the fact that all machine learning libraries (e.g. scikit-learn) and deep learning frameworks (e.g. Tensorflow, Pytorch) provide helper functions and convenient examples that use MNIST out of the box."

Why did the author choose to use the standard COCO metrics for the comparison of Mask R-CNN to the state of the art on the COCO dataset ?,"No, the results do not come from training only on a video dataset. The authors train the model on a combination of video and image datasets, and use techniques such as joint training and classifier-free guidance to improve the quality of the generated videos","The standard COCO metrics were used for the comparison of Mask R-CNN to the state of the art on the COCO dataset, but the reason is not strongly discussed int paragraphs.","We perform a thorough comparison of Mask R-CNN to the state of the art along with comprehensive ablations on the COCO dataset [28]. We report the standard COCO metrics including AP (averaged over IoU thresholds), AP{}_{50}, AP{}_{75}, and AP{}_{S}, AP{}_{M}, AP{}_{L} (AP at different scales). Unless noted, AP is evaluating using mask IoU. As in previous work [5, 27], we train using the union of 80k train images and a 35k subset of val images (trainval35k), and report ablations on the remaining 5k val images (minival). We also report results on test-dev [28]."
What is instance segmentation ?,"An online experiment is conducted on a live system, where the results are observed in real-time, while an offline experiment is conducted on a static dataset, where the results are observed after the experiment is completed","Instance segmentation is a new type of computer vision task that aims to solve the problem of how to represent all objects in an image. It combines elements from the classical computer vision tasks of object detection and localizing each object using a bounding box, and semantic segmentation.","Instance segmentation is challenging because it requires the correct detection of all objects in an image while also precisely segmenting each instance. It therefore combines elements from the classical computer vision tasks of object detection, where the goal is to classify individual objects and localize each using a bounding box, and semantic segmentation, where the goal is to classify each pixel into a fixed set of categories without differentiating object instances.111Following common terminology, we use object detection to denote detection via bounding boxes, not masks, and semantic segmentation to denote per-pixel classification without differentiating instances. Yet we note that instance segmentation is both semantic and a form of detection. Given this, one might expect a complex method is required to achieve good results. However, we show that a surprisingly simple, flexible, and fast system can surpass prior state-of-the-art instance segmentation results."
What is the loss used during training of Faster R-CNN ?,Positional information should be interpreted as a geometric progression of sinusoidal waves with wavelengths ranging from 2π to 10000π,"For an RoI associated with ground-truth class k, L_{mask} is only defined on the k-th mask, where L is the average binary cross-entropy loss. The classification loss L Cls and bounding-box loss L_Box .","Formally, during training, we define a multi-task loss on each sampled RoI as L=L_{cls}+L_{box}+L_{mask}. The classification loss L_{cls} and bounding-box loss L_{box} are identical as those defined in [12]. The mask branch has a Km^{2}-dimensional output for each RoI, which encodes K binary masks of resolution m\times m, one for each of the K classes. To this we apply a per-pixel sigmoid, and define L_{mask} as the average binary cross-entropy loss. For an RoI associated with ground-truth class k, L_{mask} is only defined on the k-th mask (other mask outputs do not contribute to the loss)."
What are the consequences of using class labels and box layouts ?,The paper defines a prototype as the mean vector of the embedded support points belonging to a class,Using class labels and box layouts make collapsing into short output vector by fully connected layers inevitable.,"A mask encodes an input object’s spatial layout. Thus, unlike class labels or box offsets that are inevitably collapsed into short output vectors by fully-connected (fc) layers, extracting the spatial structure of masks can be addressed naturally by the pixel-to-pixel correspondence provided by convolutions."
What are the hyperparameters used for inference ?,"Other approaches for semantic similarity include generate and retrieve (Mao et al., 2021) methods, which differ from Sentence Transformers in architecture and performance","various hyperparameter are:
learning rate of 0.02 ,bounding-box NMS with a threshold of 0.5 , floating-number mask output is  resized to the RoI size, and binarized at a threshold of 0.5.","At test time, the proposal number is 300 for the C4 backbone (as in [36]) and 1000 for FPN (as in [27]). We run the box prediction branch on these proposals, followed by non-maximum suppression [14]. The mask branch is then applied to the highest scoring 100 detection boxes. Although this differs from the parallel computation used in training, it speeds up inference and improves accuracy (due to the use of fewer, more accurate RoIs). The mask branch can predict K masks per RoI, but we only use the k-th mask, where k is the predicted class by the classification branch. The m\timesm floating-number mask output is then resized to the RoI size, and binarized at a threshold of 0.5. Models are trained on all COCO trainval35k images that contain annotated keypoints. To reduce overfitting, as this training set is smaller, we train using image scales randomly sampled from [640, 800] pixels; inference is on a single scale of 800 pixels. We train for 90k iterations, starting from a learning rate of 0.02 and reducing it by 10 at 60k and 80k iterations. We use bounding-box NMS with a threshold of 0.5. Other details are identical as in §3.1."
Does adding the third branch result in better results for the Mask R-CNN over the faster R-CNN ?,"Superkernel and supernet are different in their purpose and composition.

A superkernel is a single, reusable component in a neural network architecture, consisting of a set of convolutional layers with a specific kernel size and expansion ratio.

On the other hand, a supernet is a pre-trained neural network that serves as a search space for a NAS technique, containing multiple possible network architectures with different topologies and parameters",Yes it does.,"Mask R-CNN is conceptually simple: Faster R-CNN has two outputs for each candidate object, a class label and a bounding-box offset; to this we add a third branch that outputs the object mask. Mask R-CNN is thus a natural and intuitive idea. But the additional mask output is distinct from the class and box outputs, requiring extraction of much finer spatial layout of an object. Next, we introduce the key elements of Mask R-CNN, including pixel-to-pixel alignment, which is the main missing piece of Fast/Faster R-CNN. More importantly, we have a unified model that can simultaneously predict boxes, segments, and keypoints while running at 5 fps. Adding a segment branch (for the person category) improves the AP{}^{\text{kp}} to 63.1 (Table 4) on test-dev. More ablations of multi-task learning on minival are in Table 5. Adding the mask branch to the box-only (i.e., Faster R-CNN) or keypoint-only versions consistently improves these tasks. However, adding the keypoint branch reduces the box/mask AP slightly, suggesting that while keypoint detection benefits from multitask training, it does not in turn help the other tasks. Nevertheless, learning all three tasks jointly enables a unified system to efficiently predict all outputs simultaneously (Figure 7)."
What metrics should be used for comparison of Mask R-CNN to the state of the art on the COCO dataset ?,"No, the reconstruction from higher layers would not be as good as reconstruction from the lower layers.

In the given context, the lower layers of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are responsible for extracting the content of the input image, while the higher layers are responsible for capturing the style. The feature responses in the higher layers are more abstract and capture the high-level content in terms of objects and their arrangement, but do not constrain the exact pixel values of the reconstruction. Therefore, the reconstruction from the higher layers would not be as detailed or accurate as the reconstruction from the lower layers, which directly capture the pixel values of the input image","Metrics used for comparison are AP , multi-scale train/test, horizontal flip test, and online hard example mining (OHEM).","We perform a thorough comparison of Mask R-CNN to the state of the art along with comprehensive ablations on the COCO dataset [28]. We report the standard COCO metrics including AP (averaged over IoU thresholds), AP{}_{50}, AP{}_{75}, and AP{}_{S}, AP{}_{M}, AP{}_{L} (AP at different scales).

We also report results on test-dev [28]. We compare Mask R-CNN to the state-of-the-art methods in instance segmentation in Table 1. All instantiations of our model outperform baseline variants of previous state-of-the-art models. This includes MNC [10] and FCIS [26], the winners of the COCO 2015 and 2016 segmentation challenges, respectively. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN with ResNet-101-FPN backbone outperforms FCIS+++ [26], which includes multi-scale train/test, horizontal flip test, and online hard example mining (OHEM) [38]. While outside the scope of this work, we expect many such improvements to be applicable to ours."
What is the reason behind the Mask R-CNN outperforming all the winner of COCO 2015 - 2016 ??,"The approaches that led to improved accuracy with lesser parameters for NASNets compared to Inception, ResNet, and PolyNet are:

1. Introduction of a novel loss function.
2. Use of NASNet-A image featurization.
3. Ensembling multiple inferences across multiple model instances and image crops","The reason is that Faster R-CNN. has two outputs for each candidate object, a class label, and a bounding-box offset; to this, we add a third branch that outputs the object mask. But the additional mask output is distinct from the class and box outputs, requiring extraction of a much finer spatial layout of an object. This model performs better than the model presented due to RoIAlign but is 0.9 points box AP lower than Mask R- CNN.","Mask R-CNN is conceptually simple: Faster R-CNN has two outputs for each candidate object, a class label and a bounding-box offset; to this we add a third branch that outputs the object mask. Mask R-CNN is thus a natural and intuitive idea. But the additional mask output is distinct from the class and box outputs, requiring extraction of much finer spatial layout of an object. Next, we introduce the key elements of Mask R-CNN, including pixel-to-pixel alignment, which is the main missing piece of Fast/Faster R-CNN. In principle Mask R-CNN is an intuitive extension of Faster R-CNN, yet constructing the mask branch properly is critical for good results. Most importantly, Faster R-CNN was not designed for pixel-to-pixel alignment between network inputs and outputs. This is most evident in how RoIPool [18, 12], the de facto core operation for attending to instances, performs coarse spatial quantization for feature extraction. To fix the misalignment, we propose a simple, quantization-free layer, called RoIAlign, that faithfully preserves exact spatial locations. Despite being a seemingly minor change, RoIAlign has a large impact: it improves mask accuracy by relative 10% to 50%, showing bigger gains under stricter localization metrics. Second, we found it essential to decouple mask and class prediction: we predict a binary mask for each class independently, without competition among classes, and rely on the network’s RoI classification branch to predict the category. In contrast, FCNs usually perform per-pixel multi-class categorization, which couples segmentation and classification, and based on our experiments works poorly for instance segmentation."
Why it is sufficient to predict a binary mask without concern for the categories once the instance has been classified as a whole ?,No. The paper also discusses the challenges of creating the large-scale object recognition benchmark dataset and highlights developments in object classification and detection that have resulted from this effort,"it is sufficient to predict a binary mask without concern for the categories once the instance has been classified as a whole because Mask R-CNN decouples mask and class prediction: as the existing box branch predicts the class label,a mask is generated  for each class without competition among classes (by a per-pixel sigmoid and a binary loss)","Mask R-CNN decouples mask and class prediction: as the existing box branch predicts the class label, we generate a mask for each class without competition among classes (by a per-pixel sigmoid and a binary loss). In Table 2b, we compare this to using a per-pixel softmax and a multinomial loss (as commonly used in FCN [30]). This alternative couples the tasks of mask and class prediction, and results in a severe loss in mask AP (5.5 points). This suggests that once the instance has been classified as a whole (by the box branch), it is sufficient to predict a binary mask without concern for the categories, which makes the model easier to train."
Is it better to use class specific or class agnostic masks in general ?,LOC-1 and LOC-2,Both  class specific or class agnostic masks in general is nearly as effective.,"Our default instantiation predicts class-specific masks, i.e., one m\timesm mask per class. Interestingly, Mask R-CNN with class-agnostic masks (i.e., predicting a single m\timesm output regardless of class) is nearly as effective: it has 29.7 mask AP vs. 30.3 for the class-specific counterpart on ResNet-50-C4. This further highlights the division of labor in our approach which largely decouples classification and segmentation."
Can we use Faster R-CNN for human pose estimation ?,Injecting information into attention layers means adding predefined patterns or constraints to the attention weights in the transformer-based neural models to reduce run-time complexity while maintaining competitive accuracy,Yes we can use Faster R-CNN for human pose estimation.,"Our framework can easily be extended to human pose estimation. We model a keypoint’s location as a one-hot mask, and adopt Mask R-CNN to predict K masks, one for each of K keypoint types (e.g., left shoulder, right elbow). This task helps demonstrate the flexibility of Mask R-CNN. Finally, we showcase the generality of our framework via the task of human pose estimation on the COCO keypoint dataset [28]. By viewing each keypoint as a one-hot binary mask, with minimal modification Mask R-CNN can be applied to detect instance-specific poses. Mask R-CNN surpasses the winner of the 2016 COCO keypoint competition, and at the same time runs at 5 fps. Mask R-CNN, therefore, can be seen more broadly as a flexible framework for instance-level recognition and can be readily extended to more complex tasks."
How is Mask R-CNN used to estimate human poses ?,"Yes, the proposed method learns better representations.

Downstream tasks refer to the tasks that the learned representations are applied to, such as linear/k-NN evaluation, semi-supervised learning, and transfer learning. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on these tasks, indicating that it learns more effective representations compared to other SSL methods","A keypoint's position is represented as a one-hot mask, then adopt Mask R-CNN to predict K masks, one for each of K keypoint types (e.g., left shoulder, right elbow) Each keypoint is seen as a single-hot binary mask, with minimum modification that may be done to identify instance-specific poses.","Our framework can easily be extended to human pose estimation.

Can we use Faster R-CNN for multi task learning ?,"The authors did not try the listening test for samples from non-zero, realistic explicit planning because they wanted to evaluate the base quality of the samples without any preference for arbitrary explicit planning. By comparing the proposed model architecture to Notewise and CVAE, they aimed to qualitatively evaluate the base quality of the samples that have flat expressions, so that quality judgments are independent of any preference of arbitrary explicit planning",mask R-CNN is bettar than Faster R-CNN in multitasking,"More importantly, we have a unified model that can simultaneously predict boxes, segments, and keypoints while running at 5 fps. Adding a segment branch (for the person category) improves the AP{}^{\text{kp}} to 63.1 (Table 4) on test-dev. More ablations of multi-task learning on minival are in Table 5. Adding the mask branch to the box-only (i.e., Faster R-CNN) or keypoint-only versions consistently improves these tasks. However, adding the keypoint branch reduces the box/mask AP slightly, suggesting that while keypoint detection benefits from multitask training, it does not in turn help the other tasks. Nevertheless, learning all three tasks jointly enables a unified system to efficiently predict all outputs simultaneously (Figure 7)."
What is the difference between Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN ?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

OOV stands for ""Out-of-Vocabulary.""","Mask R-CNN has pixel-to-pixel alignment whereas Faster R-CNN doesn't.Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting segmentation masks on each Region of Interest (RoI), in parallel with the existing branch for classification and bounding box regression","Mask R-CNN is conceptually simple: Faster R-CNN has two outputs for each candidate object, a class label and a bounding-box offset; to this we add a third branch that outputs the object mask.

Mask R-CNN is simple to implement and train given the Faster R-CNN framework, which facilitates a wide range of flexible architecture designs.

Despite being a seemingly minor change, RoIAlign has a large impact: it improves mask accuracy by relative 10% to 50%, showing bigger gains under stricter localization metrics. Second, we found it essential to decouple mask and class prediction: we predict a binary mask for each class independently, without competition among classes, and rely on the network’s RoI classification branch to predict the category. In contrast, FCNs usually perform per-pixel multi-class categorization, which couples segmentation and classification, and based on our experiments works poorly for instance segmentation."
How can we solve the chllenges of image segmentation ?,Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) problem,"In this paper, It is shown that a surprisingly simple, flexible, and fast system can surpass prior state-of-the-art instance segmentation results. We use object detection to denote detection via bounding boxes, not masks, and semantic segmentation to denote per-pixel classification without differentiating instances. Given this, one might expect a complex method to be required to achieve good results.","Instance segmentation is challenging because it requires the correct detection of all objects in an image while also precisely segmenting each instance. It therefore combines elements from the classical computer vision tasks of object detection, where the goal is to classify individual objects and localize each using a bounding box, and semantic segmentation, where the goal is to classify each pixel into a fixed set of categories without differentiating object instances.111Following common terminology, we use object detection to denote detection via bounding boxes, not masks, and semantic segmentation to denote per-pixel classification without differentiating instances. Yet we note that instance segmentation is both semantic and a form of detection. Given this, one might expect a complex method is required to achieve good results. However, we show that a surprisingly simple, flexible, and fast system can surpass prior state-of-the-art instance segmentation results. Most recently, Li et al. [26] combined the segment proposal system in [8] and object detection system in [11] for “fully convolutional instance segmentation” (FCIS). The common idea in [8, 11, 26] is to predict a set of position-sensitive output channels fully convolutionally. These channels simultaneously address object classes, boxes, and masks, making the system fast. But FCIS exhibits systematic errors on overlapping instances and creates spurious edges (Figure 6), showing that it is challenged by the fundamental difficulties of segmenting instances. Mask R-CNN outputs are visualized in Figures 2 and 5. Mask R-CNN achieves good results even under challenging conditions. In Figure 6 we compare our Mask R-CNN baseline and FCIS+++ [26]. FCIS+++ exhibits systematic artifacts on overlapping instances, suggesting that it is challenged by the fundamental difficulty of instance segmentation. Mask R-CNN shows no such artifacts."
Was the GPT3 model finetuned on Self-Instruct also finetuned only on 50k instances?,"In ""character""-delimited models, OOV words are converted into sequences of special tokens with prefixes, whereas in ""word""-delimited models, OOV words are collapsed into a single UNK symbol","Based on the introduction, it appears as though the authors may have finetuned their GPT3-Self Instruct model with 82k samples.","To evaluate SELF-INSTRUCT empirically, we run this framework on GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), which is a vanilla LM (§4). The iterative SELF-INSTRUCT process on this model leads to about 52k instructions, paired with about 82K instance inputs and target outputs. We observe that the resulting data provides a diverse range of creative tasks and over 50% of them have less than 0.3 ROUGE-L overlaps with the seed instructions (§4.2). On this resulting data, we build GPT3SELF-INST by fine-tuning GPT3 (i.e., the same model used for generating the instructional data). We evaluate GPT3SELF-INST in comparison to various other models on both typical NLP tasks included in SUPER-NATURALINSTRUCTIONS (Wang et al., 2022), and a set of new instructions that are created for novel usage of instruction-following models (§5). The SUPERNI results indicate that GPT3SELF-INST outperforms GPT3 (the original model) by a large margin (+33.1%) and nearly matches the performance of InstructGPT001. Moreover, our human evaluation on the newly-created instruction set shows that GPT3SELF-INST demonstrates a broad range of instruction-following ability, outperforming models trained on other publicly available instruction datasets and leaving only a 5% gap behind InstructGPT001."
Why is it crucial for the pipeline to identify whether the instruction represents a classification task? How are classification tasks particularly distinct or special?,"Class imbalance for single stage detectors causes two problems: (1) training is inefficient as most locations are easy negatives that contribute no useful learning signal, and (2) en masse, the easy negatives can overwhelm training and lead to degenerate models","The main reason why this is a crucial step is because the authors’ pipeline uses a different approach for classification tasks. For non-classification tasks, the authors first prompt a language model to come up with the input fields require, then provide sample inputs, for which the language model generates outputs. However, for classification tasks, the authors first generate the list of classes, and then require the model to provide an example for that instruction for each class. They do this because the first approach, used for non-classification instructions, does not work well for unbalanced classes. This step, of identifying classification tasks, is important since it is not possible to use the same generation technique for both classification and non-classification tasks effectively with the same generation method.","Our pipeline for generating the instruction data consists of four steps: 1) instruction generation, 2) identifying whether the instruction represents a classification task or not, 3) instance generation with the input-first or the output-first approach, and 4) filtering low-quality data. Because we need two different approaches for classification and non-classification tasks, we next identify whether the generated instruction represents a classification task or not.333More concretely, we regard tasks that have a limited and small output label space as classification tasks.We prompt vanilla GPT3 few-shot to determine this, using 12 classification instructions and 19 non-classification instructions from the seed tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 7. Given the instructions and their task type, we generate instances for each instruction independently. This is challenging because it requires the model to understand what the target task is, based on the instruction, figure out what additional input fields are needed and generate them, and finally complete the task by producing the output. We found that pretrained language models can achieve this to a large extent when prompted with instruction-input-output in-context examples from other tasks.A natural way to do this is the Input-first Approach, where we can ask a language model to come up with the input fields first based on the instruction, and then produce the corresponding output. This generation order is similar to how models are used to respond to instruction and input, but here with in-context examples from other tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 8. However, we found that this approach can generate inputs biased toward one label, especially for classification tasks (e.g., for grammar error detection, it usually generates grammatical input). Therefore, we additionally propose an Output-first Approach for classification tasks, where we first gener-ate the possible class labels, and then condition the input generation on each class label. The prompting template is shown in Table 9.4 We apply the output-first approach to the classification tasks identified in the former step, and the input-first approach to the remaining non-classification tasks."
What are the existing public datasets that contain instructions for tuning large language models?,"The encoder-decoder model does not require labeled objects in videos because it learns to extract useful features based on the physical properties of the world, such as motion and appearance, rather than relying on explicit object labels","PromptSource and Super-NaturalInstructions (also called ""super-NI"" in short) are two existing public datasets that contain instructions for tuning large language models.","The recent NLP literature has witnessed a tremendous amount of activity in building models that can follow natural language instructions (Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022, i.a.).These developments are powered by two key components: large pre-trained language models (LM) and human-written instruction data.PromptSource (Bach et al., 2022) and Super-NaturalInstructions (Wang et al., 2022) are two notable recent datasets that use extensive manual annotation for collecting instructions to construct T0 Bach et al. (2022); Sanh et al. (2022) and Tk-Instruct Wang et al. (2022).However, this process is costly and often suffers limited diversity given that most human generations tend to be popular NLP tasks, falling short of covering a true variety of tasks and different ways to describe them.Given these limitations, continuing to improve the quality of instruction-tuned modelsnecessitates the development of alternative approaches for supervising instruction-tuned models. A series of works have found evidence that vanilla language models can be effective at following general language instructions if tuned with annotated “instructional” data – datasets containing language instructional commands and their desired outcome based on human judgement Weller et al.

What is the similarities and differences between the NaturalInstructions dataset and the SuperNaturalInstructions dataset?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

No.

Task-independent sentence representations are a type of representation that can be learned by a model to capture the meaning of sentences in a way that is not specific to any particular task or dataset. Embeddings, on the other hand, are a type of vector representation that maps words or sentences to a dense vector space, where similar words or sentences are close together in the vector space. While embeddings can be used for a variety of tasks, they are not necessarily task-independent, as the same embedding space may be used for different tasks","This paper only mentions and discusses the SuperNaturalInstructions (or SuperNI) dataset, and does not explicitly discuss the NaturalInstructions dataset. However, based on the naming, it is possible that both the Supe- NaturalInstructiuons and NaturalInstructions datasets are datasets that contain annotated instructional data to help large language models (LLMs) perform a wider range of specialized tasks.","Despite the comprehensiveness of SuperNI in collecting existing NLP tasks, most of these NLP tasks were proposed for research purposes and skewed toward classification. To better access the practical value of instruction-following models, a subset of the authors curate a new set of instructions motivated by user-oriented applications.We first brainstorm different domains where large LMs may be useful (e.g., email writing, social media, productivity tools, entertainment, programming), then craft instructions related to each domain along with an input-output instance (again, input is optional). We aim to diversify the styles and formats of these tasks (e.g., instructions may be long or short; input/output may take the form of bullet points, tables, codes, equations, etc.). In total, we create 252 instructions with 1 instance per instruction. We believe it can serve as a testbed for evaluating how instruction-based models handle diverse and unfamiliar instructions.

"If LMs have been found to be biased and limited in creativity, how would LMs be able to create instructions that cover a greater diversity of tasks compared to humans who might be able to imagine possible tasks?","The main structural difference between applying R-GCN to entity classification and link prediction is the use of a tensor factorization model in the latter task. In entity classification, the R-GCN outputs a set of node representations that are directly used for classification, while in link prediction, the R-GCN outputs a set of node representations that are then used as input to a tensor factorization model to predict the missing links","LMs might be able to create instructions covering a greater diversity of tasks since they are trained on a large corpus of material that encompasses the work of many humans. Additionally, the authors' proposed approach, Self-Instruct, uses a bootstrapping phase where humans provide the first set of instructions, and a LM uses those as examples to generate more instructions. Approaches such as these, combining the efforts of a human and a language model, might be one way to ensure LMs create a wider array of tasks. However, the authors do acknowledge that LMs are prone to be biased towards commonly occurring sequences, at the cost of rarer sequences, meaning that this is an open research question.","Annotating large-scale instruction data can be challenging for humans because it requires 1) creativity to come up with novel tasks and 2) expertise for writing the labeled instances for each task.In this section, we detail our process for Self-Instruct, which refers to the pipeline of generating tasks with a vanilla pretrained language model itself and then conducting instruction tuning with this generated data in order to align the language model to follow instructions better. This pipeline is depicted in Figure 1. Self-Instruct is based on a finding that large pretrained language models can be prompted to generate new and novel instructions when presented with some existing instructions in the context. This provides us with a way to grow the instruction data from a small set of seed human-written instructions.We propose to generate a diverse set of instructions in a bootstrapping fashion. We initiate the task pool with 175 tasks (1 instruction and 1 instance for each task) written by our authors. For every step, we sample 8 task instructions from this pool as in-context examples.Of the 8 instructions, 6 are from the human-written tasks,and 2 are from the model-generated tasks in previous steps to promote diversity.The prompting template is shown in Table 6. To encourage diversity, a new instruction is added to the task pool only when its ROUGE-L overlap with any existing instruction is less than 0.7.We also exclude instructions that contain some specific keywords (e.g., images, pictures, graphs) that usually can not be processed by language models. When generating new instances for each instruction, we filter out instances that are exactly the same or those with the same input but different outputs. Despite the comprehensiveness of SuperNI in collecting existing NLP tasks, most of these NLP tasks were proposed for research purposes and skewed toward classification. To better access the practical value of instruction-following models, a subset of the authors curate a new set of instructions motivated by user-oriented applications.We first brainstorm different domains where large LMs may be useful (e.g., email writing, social media, productivity tools, entertainment, programming), then craft instructions related to each domain along with an input-output instance (again, input is optional).

Table 4 presents a small portion of the 252 tasks. The whole test set will be available upon request. Self-Instruct depends on LMs, and it will inherit all the limitations that carry over with LMs.As recent studies have shown Razeghi et al. (2022); Kandpal et al. (2022), tail phenomena pose a serious challenge to the success of LMs. In other words, LMs’ largest gains correspond to the frequent uses of languages (head of the language use distribution), and there are minimal gains in the low-frequency contexts.Similarly, in the context of this work, it would not be surprising if the majority of the gains by Self-Instruct are skewed towardtasks or instructions that present more frequently in the pre-training corpus.As a consequence, the approach might show brittleness with respect to uncommon and creative instructions."
What type of new tasks was Self-Instruct able to generate which were not seen in previous human-created instruction datasets?,"A recurrent state space refers to the set of internal states that an RNN or LSTM model uses to capture information from previous time steps, allowing it to process sequences of data","The paper mentions that their model is used to generate 52,000 instructions and 82,000 input-output pairs, for a wide range of tasks, which the authors have made publicly available. It might be possible to find more information on the specific tasks that were created by looking at this synthetic dataset, but the paper itself does not contain concrete examples.","A series of recent works Zhou et al. (2022b); Ye et al. (2022); Singh et al. (2022); Honovich et al. (2022) generate instructions of a task given a few examples. While Self-Instruct also involves instruction generation, a major difference in our case is it is task-agnostic; we generate new tasks (instructions along with instances) from scratch. Annotating large-scale instruction data can be challenging for humans because it requires 1) creativity to come up with novel tasks and 2) expertise for writing the labeled instances for each task.In this section, we detail our process for Self-Instruct, which refers to the pipeline of generating tasks with a vanilla pretrained language model itself and then conducting instruction tuning with this generated data in order to align the language model to follow instructions better.

In summary, our contributions are: (1) Self-Instruct, a method for inducing instruction-following capabilitywith minimal human-labeled data;(2) We demonstrate its effectiveness via extensive instruction-tuning experiments;(3) We release a large synthetic dataset of 52K instructions and a set of manually-written novel tasks for building and evaluating future instruction-following models."
"Beyond correctness, why did the authors not evaluate the actual quality, meaning, or usefulness of the generated instructions?",Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is used for monocular depth and camera motion estimation,"One reason to explain why the authors did not perform more comprehensive quality evaluation of the generated outputs is the difficulty in judging the output of the model. Some tasks cannot be quickly verified by the average human (one example the authors provide for this is converting first-order logic into natural language - a task that only experts with the appropriate domain knowledge can perform). However, despite this challenge, the authors do perform some analysis to gauge the overall quality of the generated samples. They randomly select 200 instructions, and for each sample they examine the quality of one instance within each instruction. Doing this evaluation reveals that their approach performs much better than a vanilla GPT3 (i.e. a bare-bones GPT3 with nothing else).","So far, we have shown the quantity and diversity of the generated data, but its quality remains uncertain. To investigate this, we randomly sample 200 instructions and randomly select 1 instance per instruction. We asked an expert annotator (co-author of this work) to label whether each instance is correct or not, in terms of the instruction, the instance input, and the instance output.Evaluation results in Table 2 show that most of the generated instructions are meaningful, while the generated instances may contain more noise (to a reasonable extent). However, we found that even though the generations may contain errors, most of them are still in the correct format or even partially correct, which can provide useful guidance for training models to follow instructions. We listed a number of good generations and bad generations in Table 10 and Table 11 respectively. Evaluating models’ performance on this evaluation set of diverse tasks is extremely challenging because different tasks require different expertise. Indeed, many of these tasks cannot be measured by automatic metrics or even be judged by normal crowdworkers (e.g., writing a program, or converting first-order logic into natural language). To get a more faithful evaluation, we asked the authors of the instructions to judge model predictions. The evaluators were asked to rate the output based on whether it accurately and effectively completes the task. We implemented a four-level rating system for categorizing the quality of the models’ outputs, defined as follows: Figure 5 provides the performance of GPT3 model and its instruction-tuned counterparts on this newly written instruction set. As anticipated, the vanilla GPT3 language model is largely unable to respond to instructions, and all instruction-tuned models demonstrate comparatively higher performance,Nonetheless, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} (i.e., GPT3 model fine-tuned with Self-Instruct) outperforms those counterparts trained on T0 or SuperNI by a large margin, demonstrating the value of the generated data despite the noise.Compared with \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}} (c.f. footnote 1), GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is quite close in the performance—if we count acceptable response with minor imperfections (Rating-3) as valid, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is only 5% behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. Lastly, our evaluation confirms the impressive instruction-following ability of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{002}} & \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{003}} models. Although there are many factors behind this success, we conjecture that future work can largely benefit from improving the quality of our generated data by using human annotators or training a reward model to select better generations, similar to the algorithm used in Ouyang et al. (2022)."
How are T0 and Tk-INSTRUCT different?,Explicit planning examples include controlling tempo or timing with a latent representation and elastically choosing various strategies to highlight multiple nuances or emotions in piano performances,"T0 and Tk-Instruct are two related models, proposed in papers published in 2022. T0 was proposed by Bach et al. and Sanh et al, while Tk-Instruct was proposed by Wang et al.

The fact that they were published in the same year, use the same datasets, and probably try to achieve similar goals indicates that, either: (1) the work for both of these approaches was done concurrently (perhaps by different groups of authors) or (2) one work was inspired from the other and might have been an extension of that. More details about either of these, including the differences are not discussed in detail in this paper, but can probably be found by referring the the respective papers mentioned for each of these.","The recent NLP literature has witnessed a tremendous amount of activity in building models that can follow natural language instructions (Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022, i.a.).These developments are powered by two key components: large pre-trained language models (LM) and human-written instruction data.PromptSource (Bach et al., 2022) and Super-NaturalInstructions (Wang et al., 2022) are two notable recent datasets that use extensive manual annotation for collecting instructions to construct T0 Bach et al.

Was the performance difference between Self-Instruct training and SuperNI training significant?,"Non-linear extension of NCA (Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2007)","While it does appear as though there is a measurable performance improvement from SuperNI to Self-Instruct, quantifying the impact and magnitude of that improvement is not straightforward. Evaluations with ROGUE-L scores find that the absolute difference between both these methods is not very high, though additional information and context may be needed to judge the meaning of the absolute difference between these numbers. The authors do claim that they outperform T0 or SuperNI by a large margin, which is strong evidence to suggest that the difference was indeed significant, but such claims must be taken with some grains of salt since authors are usually incentivized to show their models are the best.","To evaluate Self-Instruct empirically, we run this framework on GPT3 Brown et al.

We call them T0 training and SuperNI training for short, respectively.To save the training budget, we sampled 50K instances (but covering all their instructions) for each dataset, which has a comparable size to the instruction data we generated. Based on the findings from Wang et al. (2022) and our early experiments, reducing the number of instances per task does not degrade the model’s generalization performance to unseen tasks. We make the following observations from the results in Table 3.Self-Instructboosts the instruction-following ability of GPT3 by a large margin. The vanilla GPT3 model basically cannot follow human instructions at all. Upon manual analysis, we find that it usually generates irrelevant and repetitive text, and does not know when to stop generation.Compared with other models that are not specifically trained for SuperNI, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} achieves better performance than T0 or the GPT3 finetuned on the T0 training set, which takes tremendous human labeling efforts. Notably, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} also nearly matches the performance of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}, which is trained with private user data and human-annotated labels. Models trained on SuperNI training set still achieve better performance on its evaluation set, which we attribute to the similar instruction style and formatting. However, we show that Self-Instruct still brings in additional gains when combined with the SuperNI training set, proving its value as complementary data.

We introduce Self-Instruct, a task-agnostic method to improve the instruction-following capabilities of language models via its own generation of instruction data (instruction, input, and output samples) and bootstrapping with it. Our method conducts instruction-tuning of the original model on the pruned subset of generated samples. On experimenting with vanilla GPT3, we observe a 33% absolute improvement over the original model on Super-NaturalInstructions. This performance is on par with \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}, which is trained with private user data and expensive human annotations. Furthermore, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks. Human evaluation on this set shows that tuning GPT3 with Self-Instruct outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5% absolute gap behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. We hope Self-Instruct can serve as the first step to align pretrained language models to follow human instructions, and future work can build on top of this data to improve instruction-following models."
"If performance can be attributed to instruction style and formatting, why did the authors not test baselines that were not fine-tuned but had few-shot examples?","The v1 model maintains consistent content by extending self-attention from one image to multiple images, allowing for cross-modal attention to verbs and spatial similarities, but not continuous motion","It is unclear why the authors did not test their baselines with few shot examples. They acknowledge this as a problem, but they justify their position by pointing out that using both SuperNI and their approach together leads to increased performance gains - indicating that their approach (Self-Instruct) and SuperNI are complementary and can be used jointly to achieve higher performance than any one method being used on its' own.","Models trained on SuperNI training set still achieve better performance on its evaluation set, which we attribute to the similar instruction style and formatting.

What is the PromptSource dataset and what kind of data does it include?,"The concatenation of the aggregated embeddings from different layers can be seen as a skip connection, as it allows the model to retain information from previous layers and combine it with new information from the current layer. This helps the model to capture longer-range dependencies and improve the overall performance of the embedding generation","The PromptSource dataset is a dataset of human-written instructions for various tasks. It probably includes instructions (and examples) for various sorts of tasks. The current paper, which focuses on attempting to automate this dataset-generation process, does not discuss details on the kind of tasks the PromptSource dataset includes, but details on the dataset could probably be found in the paper Bach et al., 2022.","The recent NLP literature has witnessed a tremendous amount of activity in building models that can follow natural language instructions (Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022, i.a.).These developments are powered by two key components: large pre-trained language models (LM) and human-written instruction data.PromptSource (Bach et al., 2022) and Super-NaturalInstructions (Wang et al., 2022) are two notable recent datasets that use extensive manual annotation for collecting instructions to construct T0 Bach et al. (2022); Sanh et al. (2022) and Tk-Instruct Wang et al. (2022).However, this process is costly and often suffers limited diversity given that most human generations tend to be popular NLP tasks, falling short of covering a true variety of tasks and different ways to describe them.Given these limitations, continuing to improve the quality of instruction-tuned modelsnecessitates the development of alternative approaches for supervising instruction-tuned models. Additionally, to compare Self-Instruct training with other publicly available instruction tuning data, we further finetune GPT3 model with data from PromptSource and SuperNI, which are used to train the T0 and Tk-Instruct models. We call them T0 training and SuperNI training for short, respectively.To save the training budget, we sampled 50K instances (but covering all their instructions) for each dataset, which has a comparable size to the instruction data we generated. Based on the findings from Wang et al. (2022) and our early experiments, reducing the number of instances per task does not degrade the model’s generalization performance to unseen tasks."
How are the results of the input-first and output-first approach different?,"ILSVRC provides several added benefits over PASCAL-VOC, including:

* 10 times more object classes
* 10.6 times more fully annotated training images
* 35.2 times more training objects
* 3.5 times more validation images
* 3.5 times more validation objects
* A wider variety of objects, including tiny objects like sunglasses and ping-pong balls","If by results, you are referring to the outputs of these approaches, then the final output will look very similar - the output for each instance will consist of a tuple of an (input, output) where input and output follow the instructions for a certain task. However, the order in which this output is generated will differ -- for example, in ""input first"" approach, the input is generated first, while in the output first case, the language model is conditioned to provide the required output. On the other hand, if, by results, you are referring to ""performance"" of both of these approaches, the authors mention that the input first approach performs very poorly on classification instances, which is why they proposed the alternative approach of output-first generation for classification tasks.","Because we need two different approaches for classification and non-classification tasks, we next identify whether the generated instruction represents a classification task or not.333More concretely, we regard tasks that have a limited and small output label space as classification tasks.We prompt vanilla GPT3 few-shot to determine this, using 12 classification instructions and 19 non-classification instructions from the seed tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 7. Given the instructions and their task type, we generate instances for each instruction independently. This is challenging because it requires the model to understand what the target task is, based on the instruction, figure out what additional input fields are needed and generate them, and finally complete the task by producing the output. We found that pretrained language models can achieve this to a large extent when prompted with instruction-input-output in-context examples from other tasks.A natural way to do this is the Input-first Approach, where we can ask a language model to come up with the input fields first based on the instruction, and then produce the corresponding output. This generation order is similar to how models are used to respond to instruction and input, but here with in-context examples from other tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 8. However, we found that this approach can generate inputs biased toward one label, especially for classification tasks (e.g., for grammar error detection, it usually generates grammatical input). Therefore, we additionally propose anOutput-first Approach for classification tasks, where we first generate the possible class labels, and then condition the input generation on each class label. The prompting template is shown in Table 9.444In this work, we use a fixed set of seed tasks for prompting the instance generation, and thus only generate a small number of instances per task in one round. Future work can use randomly sampled tasks to prompt the model to generate a larger number of instances in multiple rounds. We apply the output-first approach to the classification tasks identified in the former step, and the input-first approach to the remaining non-classification tasks."
Who were the authors of the instructions?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the given context:

Yes, normal cells and reduction cells that come out as search results will be different for each dataset","The authors of the paper created the first set of 175 instructions themselves. After that, they used an iterative bootstrapping process in which they used GPT3 to create more tasks (and instructions). In the end, they ended up with a dataset of 52k instructions.","The instruction data we want to generate contains a set of instructions \{I_{t}\}, each of which defines a task t in natural language. Each task has one or more input-output instances (X_{t},Y_{t}).A model M is expected to produce the output y, given the task instruction I_{t} and the instance input x: M(I_{t},x)=y,\;\mbox{for}\ (x,y)\in(X_{t},Y_{t}).Note that the instruction and instance input does not have a strict boundary in many cases. For example, “write an essay about school safety” can be a valid instruction that we expect models to respond to directly, while it can also be formulated as “write an essay about the following topic” as the instruction, and “school safety” as an instance input. To encourage the diversity of the data format, we allow such instructions that do not require additional input (i.e., x is empty). Self-Instruct is based on a finding that large pretrained language models can be prompted to generate new and novel instructions when presented with some existing instructions in the context. This provides us with a way to grow the instruction data from a small set of seed human-written instructions.We propose to generate a diverse set of instructions in a bootstrapping fashion. We initiate the task pool with 175 tasks (1 instruction and 1 instance for each task) written by our authors. For every step, we sample 8 task instructions from this pool as in-context examples.Of the 8 instructions, 6 are from the human-written tasks,and 2 are from the model-generated tasks in previous steps to promote diversity.The prompting template is shown in Table 6. So far, we have shown the quantity and diversity of the generated data, but its quality remains uncertain. To investigate this, we randomly sample 200 instructions and randomly select 1 instance per instruction. We asked an expert annotator (co-author of this work) to label whether each instance is correct or not, in terms of the instruction, the instance input, and the instance output.Evaluation results in Table 2 show that most of the generated instructions are meaningful, while the generated instances may contain more noise (to a reasonable extent). However, we found that even though the generations may contain errors, most of them are still in the correct format or even partially correct, which can provide useful guidance for training models to follow instructions. We listed a number of good generations and bad generations in Table 10 and Table 11 respectively. In summary, our contributions are: (1) Self-Instruct, a method for inducing instruction-following capabilitywith minimal human-labeled data;(2) We demonstrate its effectiveness via extensive instruction-tuning experiments;(3) We release a large synthetic dataset of 52K instructions and a set of manually-written novel tasks for building and evaluating future instruction-following models."
"How did the authors judge that the generated instructions were ""meaningful""?","Sure! Here's my answer:

Model performance","The authors judged a generated instruction as meaningful by seeing if it described a valid task. Out of the 200 randomly sampled instructions, they found 92% of them described a valid task.","So far, we have shown the quantity and diversity of the generated data, but its quality remains uncertain. To investigate this, we randomly sample 200 instructions and randomly select 1 instance per instruction.

However, we found that even though the generations may contain errors, most of them are still in the correct format or even partially correct, which can provide useful guidance for training models to follow instructions. We listed a number of good generations and bad generations in Table 10 and Table 11 respectively."
Why are the gains of instruction-tuning higher for larger models?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The distribution of background and foreground samples does not change significantly as γ changes","The authors theorize that their approach probably works better for larger models due to it's dependence on language models' inductive biases, but they offer no extra explanation or detail to clarify or explain their stance.","Because of Self-Instruct’s dependence on the inductive biases extracted from LMs, it might work best for larger models.If true, this may create barriers to access for those who may not have large computing resources.We hope future studies will carefully study the gains as a function of model size or various other parameters.It is worthwhile to note that instruction-tuning with human annotation also suffers from a similar limitation: gains of instruction-tuning are higher for larger model Wei et al. (2022)."
How did they finetune GPT3?,"No, the authors use the same ratio of test-train-validation split for all datasets","The authors fine-tuned the GPT3 model via an OpenAI API. The model, which is also called ""da vinci"", was dine-tuned by the authors for 2 epochs with a prompt loss weight set to zero.","In this section, we apply our method for inducing instruction data to GPT3 as a case study. We use the largest GPT3 language model (“davinci” engine) accessed through the OpenAI API555https://openai.com/api/. The parameters for making queries are described in Appendix A.1. Here we present an overview of the generated data. With the instruction-generated instruction data, we conduct instruction tuning for the GPT3 model itself (the “davinci” engine). As we described in §3.3, we use various templates to concatenate the instruction and input, and train the model to generate the output. This finetuning is done through the OpenAI finetuning API777https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning. We use the default hyper-parameters, except that we set the prompt loss weight to 0, and we train the model for 2 epochs. We refer the readers to Appendix A.2 for additional finetuning details. The resulting model is denoted as GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}}."
What if one of the generated questions was poor in quality? Wouldn't this result in errors being propagated through the dataset to generate a high number of low quality instructions?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

The BLEU scores fluctuate for sentence lengths less than 40 due to the variability in the quality of the generated translations for short sentences","Yes, if one of the generated examples is of poor quality, it is possible that this error could propogate through the dataset leading to a high number of erroneous or low-quality instructions. However, the authors do evaluate and compare the quality of generated samples and find that most samples are of high quality. Even out of those samples that are not fully correct, most of them are atleast partly correct. However, this is a concern with iterative algorithms such as this, a problem probably noted by the authors as an open research question.","Self-Instruct is based on a finding that large pretrained language models can be prompted to generate new and novel instructions when presented with some existing instructions in the context.

We listed a number of good generations and bad generations in Table 10 and Table 11 respectively. A point of concern for the authors is the unintended consequences of this iterative algorithm, such as the amplification of problematic social biases (stereotypes or slurs about genders, races, etc.).Relatedly, one observed challenge in this process is the algorithm’s difficulty in producing balanced labels, which reflected models’ prior biases.We hope future work will hash out such details to better understand the pros and cons of the approach."
"Why do the authors claim that human feedback may be less important when their experiments showed that InstructGPT, which had human-generated data, outperformed their model without human-generated data?",To capture the smooth and continuous nature of expressive parameters,"The authors claim that human feedback might not be essential since their model is able to almost meet the performance of InstructGPT despite not having access to private human-generated training data or manual annotations. They claim that their model's success, of almost reaching InstructGPT performance with only a 5% gap is a strong indication that human data, while useful is not necessarily essential for teaching models how to follow instructions. Additionally, they point out that their work is merely a beginning step in research in this field - while numerous studies have successfully used human annotations to improve performance, studies that attempt to remove the human requirement have not been as explored. Also, the authors do acknowledge that the truth is somewhere in between the two extremes of (1) human instructional data is essential, or (2) such data is largely optional, and similar results can be achieved without it.","To evaluate Self-Instruct empirically, we run this framework on GPT3 Brown et al. (2020), which is a vanilla LM (§4).The iterative Self-Instruct process on this model leads to about 52k instructions, paired with about 82K instance inputs and target outputs.We observe that the resulting data provides a diverse range of creative tasks and over 50% of them have less than 0.3 ROUGE-L overlaps with the seed instructions (§4.2).On this resulting data, we build GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} by fine-tuning GPT3 (i.e., the same model used for generating the instructional data).We evaluate GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} in comparison to various other models on both typical NLP tasks included in Super-NaturalInstructions Wang et al. (2022), and a set of new instructions that are created for novel usage of instruction-following models (§5).The SuperNI results indicate thatGPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} outperforms GPT3 (the original model) by a large margin (+33.1%) and nearly matches the performance of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. Moreover, our human evaluation on the newly-created instruction set shows that GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} demonstrates a broad range of instruction following ability, outperforming models trained on other publicly available instruction datasets and leaving only a 5% gap behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. We evaluate \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{}} Ouyang et al. (2022),which is developed by OpenAI based on GPT3 to follow human instructions better and has been found by the community to have impressive zero-shot abilities.There are various generations of these models,where newer ones use more expansive data or algorithmic novelties101010https://beta.openai.com/docs/model-index-for-researchers.For our SuperNI experiments in §5.3, we only compare with their text-davinci-001 engine, because their newer engines are trained with the latest user data and are likely to already see the SuperNI evaluation set. For our human evaluation of these models on newly written instructions, we include their 001, 002 and 003 engines for completeness. We make the following observations from the results in Table 3.Self-Instructboosts the instruction-following ability of GPT3 by a large margin. The vanilla GPT3 model basically cannot follow human instructions at all. Upon manual analysis, we find that it usually generates irrelevant and repetitive text, and does not know when to stop generation.Compared with other models that are not specifically trained for SuperNI, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} achieves better performance than T0 or the GPT3 finetuned on the T0 training set, which takes tremendous human labeling efforts. Notably, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} also nearly matches the performance of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}, which is trained with private user data and human-annotated labels. Figure 5 provides the performance of GPT3 model and its instruction-tuned counterparts on this newly written instruction set. As anticipated, the vanilla GPT3 language model is largely unable to respond to instructions, and all instruction-tuned models demonstrate comparatively higher performance,Nonetheless, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} (i.e., GPT3 model fine-tuned with Self-Instruct) outperforms those counterparts trained on T0 or SuperNI by a large margin, demonstrating the value of the generated data despite the noise.Compared with \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}} (c.f. footnote 1), GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is quite close in the performance—if we count acceptable response with minor imperfections (Rating-3) as valid, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is only 5% behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. Lastly, our evaluation confirms the impressive instruction-following ability of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{002}} & \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{003}} models. Although there are many factors behind this success, we conjecture that future work can largely benefit from improving the quality of our generated data by using human annotators or training a reward model to select better generations, similar to the algorithm used in Ouyang et al. (2022). A series of works have found evidence that vanilla language models can be effective at following general language instructions if tuned with annotated “instructional” data – datasets containing language instructional commands and their desired outcome based on human judgement Weller et al. (2020); Mishra et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2022); Wei et al. (2022); Sanh et al. (2022); Ouyang et al. (2022); Parmar et al. (2022); Scialom et al. (2022); Chung et al. (2022); Luo et al. (2022); Puri et al. (2022); Yin et al. (2022); Chakrabarty et al. (2022); Lin et al. (2022); Gupta et al. (2022); Muennighoff et al. (2022).Additionally, they show a direct correlation between the size and diversity of the “instructional” data and the generalizability of resulting models to unseen tasks.Since these developments depend on human annotated “instructional” data, this poses a bottleneck for progress toward more generalizable models(for example see Fig. 5a in Wang et al., 2022).Our work aims to tackle this bottleneck by reducing the dependence on human annotators. (H_{1})Human feedback is a necessary and indispensable aspect of instruction-tuning as LMs need to learn about issues that were not quite learned during pre-training.(H_{2})Human feedback is an optional aspect of instruction-tuning as LMs are already quite familiar with instructions from their pre-training. Observing the human feedback is merely a lightweight process for aligning their pre-training distribution/objective which might be replaceable with a different process.While the reality probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes, we conjecturethat it is closer to H_{2}, particularly for larger models.This intuition, that LMs already know much about language instructions, is a key motivation for Self-Instruct and is also supported by its empirical success. We introduce Self-Instruct, a task-agnostic method to improve the instruction-following capabilities of language models via its own generation of instruction data (instruction, input, and output samples) and bootstrapping with it. Our method conducts instruction-tuning of the original model on the pruned subset of generated samples. On experimenting with vanilla GPT3, we observe a 33% absolute improvement over the original model on Super-NaturalInstructions. This performance is on par with \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}, which is trained with private user data and expensive human annotations. Furthermore, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks. Human evaluation on this set shows that tuning GPT3 with Self-Instruct outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5% absolute gap behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. We hope Self-Instruct can serve as the first step to align pretrained language models to follow human instructions, and future work can build on top of this data to improve instruction-following models. Additionally, despite the remarkable performance of models like \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{}} Ouyang et al. (2022), their construction process remains quite opaque.In particular, the role of data has remained understudied due to limited transparency and data released by major corporate entities behind these key models.Addressing such challenges necessitates the creation of a large-scale, public dataset covering a broad range of tasks."
"What is the ""verb-noun structure"" and what does it show?","Sure! Here's the answer to the question using the provided context:

Cutout data augmentation improves the NASNet-A model error rate by providing the model with a more diverse set of training examples, which helps the model learn to recognize the features more accurately","The ""verb-noun structure"" of a sentence is created by identifying the primary verb (action word) in a sentence and identify the corresponding noun that action is being performed on. The authors use this structure to identify what kinds of tasks (i.e. verbs/action words) are used along with specific kinds of nouns.","To study what types of instructions are generated and how diverse they are, we identify the verb-noun structure in the generated instructions. We use the Berkeley Neural Parser666https://parser.kitaev.io/ (Kitaev and Klein, 2018; Kitaev et al., 2019) to parse the instructions, and then extract the verb that is closest to the root of the parse tree as well as its first direct noun object. 26,559 out of the 52,445 instructions contain such structure; other instructions usually contain more complex clauses (e.g., “Classify whether this tweet contains political content or not.”) or are framed as questions (e.g., “Which of these statements are true?”).We plot the top 20 most common root verbs and their top 4direct noun objects in Figure 4, which accounts for 14% of the entire set. Overall, we see quite diverse intents and textual formats in these instructions."
What is the motivation behind learning disentangled representations of data ?,"No, the phrase ""data with larger spatial support than the typical size of the anatomy"" does not refer to feature maps with a larger number of channels than the input map at the deepest layer. Instead, it refers to the fact that the features computed in the deepest layer are computed from data that has a larger spatial support than the typical size of the anatomy being segmented, which imposes global constraints on the segmentation",The motivation behind learning disentangled representations of data is a desire to achieve interpretability particularly the decomposability of latent representations to admit intuitive explanations. Another motivation of learning disentangled representations is to generalize framework of decomposition.,"An oft-stated motivation for learning disentangled representations of data with deep generative models is a desire to achieve interpretability [5, 10]—particularly the decomposability [see §3.2.1 in 33] of latent representations to admit intuitive explanations.Most work has focused on capturing purely independent factors of variation [10, 7, 16, 25, 4, 57, 3, 8, 17, 15, 59], typically evaluating this using purpose-built, synthetic data [15, 17, 25], whose generative factors are independent by construction. In this work, we explored and analysed the fundamental characteristics of learning disentangled representations, and showed how these can be generalised to a more general framework of decomposition [33].We characterised the learning of decomposed latent representation with vaes in terms of the control of two factors:i) overlap in the latent space between encodings of different datapoints, andii) regularisation of the aggregate encoding distribution to the given prior, which encodes the structure one would wish for the latent space to have."
What is the aim of using VAEs ?,mAP (mean Average Precision) is used to compare the performance between YOLO and DPM/R-CNN,The aim to use VAEs is to explore their decomposition capability to fulfill latent encoding of overlapping data and aggregate encoding of this data conforming to desired structure. The approaches that explore disentanglement in the context of  VAEs aims to achieve independence between the dimensions of the aggregate encoding.,"Of particular relevance to this work are approaches that explore disentanglement in the context of vaes [17, 3, 51, 25, 8, 16].Here one aims to achieve independence between the dimensions of the aggregate encoding, typically defined asq_{\phi}(\bm{z})\triangleq\operatorname{{}\mathbb{E}}_{p_{\mathcal{D}}(\bm{x})}\left[q(\bm{z}|\bm{x})\right]\approx\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n}q(\bm{z}|\bm{x}_{i}).The significance of q_{\phi}(\bm{z}) is that it is the marginal distribution induced on the latents by sampling a datapoint and then using the encoder to sample an encoding given that datapoint. It can thus informally be thought of as the pushforward distribution for “sampling” representations in the latent space. We characterise the decomposition of latent spaces in vaes to be the fulfilment of two factors (as shown in Figure 1):a.An “appropriate” level of overlap in the latent space—ensuring that the range of latent values capable of encoding a particular datapoint is neither too small, nor too large.This is, in general, dictated by the level of stochasticity in the encoder: the noisier the encoding process is, the higher the number of datapoints which can plausibly give rise to a particular encoding.b.The aggregate encoding q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) matching the prior p\left(\bm{z}\right), where the latter expresses the desired dependency structure between latents. We posit a generalisation of disentanglement in vaes—decomposing their latent representations—that can help avoid such pitfalls.We characterise decomposition in vaes as the fulfilment of two factors:a) the latent encodings of data having an appropriate level of overlap, andb) the aggregate encoding of data conforming to a desired structure, represented through the prior.We emphasize that neither of these factors is sufficient in isolation: withoutan appropriate level of overlap, encodings can degrade to a lookup tablewhere the latents convey little information about data, and without the aggregate encoding of data following a desired structure, the encodings do not decompose as desired."

What is Disentanglement ?,The probability percentages of 90% and 50% were chosen based on empirical evaluation and trial-and-error,"Disentanglement refers to independence among features in a representation. The idea stems back to traditional methods such as ICA and conventional autoencoders. Disentanglement implicitly makes a choice of decomposition: that the latent features are independent of one another. Much of the prior work in the field has either implicitly or explicitly presumed a slightly more ambitious definition of disentanglement than considered above: that it is a measure of how well one captures true factors of variation (which happen to be independent by construction for synthetic data), rather than just independent factors. The commonly assumed notion of disentanglement is quite restrictive for complex models where the true generative factors are not independent, very large in number, or where it cannot be reasonably assumed that there is a well-defined set of “true” generative factors.","Much of the prior work in the field has either implicitly or explicitly presumed a slightly more ambitious definition of disentanglement than considered above: that it is a measure of how well one captures true factors of variation (which happen to be independent by construction for synthetic data), rather than just independent factors.After all, if we wish for our learned representations to be interpretable, it is necessary for the latent variables to take on clear-cut meaning. The commonly assumed notion of disentanglement is quite restrictive for complex models where the true generative factors are not independent, very large in number, or where it cannot be reasonably assumed that there is a well-defined set of “true” generative factors (as will be the case for many, if not most, real datasets).To this end, we introduce a generalization of disentanglement, decomposition, which at a high-level can be thought of as imposing a desired structure on the learned representations.This permits disentanglement as a special case, for which the desired structure is that q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) factors along its dimensions. Disentanglement implicitly makes a choice of decomposition: that the latent features are independent of one another.We make this explicit and exploit it to both provide improvement to disentanglement through judicious choices of structure in the prior, and to introduce a more general framework flexible enough to capture alternate, more complex, notions of decomposition such as sparsity, clustering, hierarchical structuring, or independent subspaces. Disentanglement, as typically employed in literature, refers to independence among features in a representation [5, 15, 18].Conceptually, however, it has a long history, far longer than we could reasonably do justice here, and is far from specific to vaes.The idea stems back to traditional methods such as ICA [58, 23] and conventional autoencoders [50], through to a range of modern approaches employing deep learning [47, 36, 9, 37, 1, 19, 11]."
Why was decomposition introduced ?,Modifying the texture of a specific object,"Decomposition can be thought of as imposing a desired structure on the learned representations at a high level.

No","The decomposition in vaes as the fulfilment of two factors: a) the latent encodings of data having an appropriate level of overlap—ensuring that the range of latent values capable of encoding a particular datapoint is neither too small, nor too large.This is, in general, dictated by the level of stochasticity in the encoder: the noisier the encoding process is, the higher the number of datapoints which can plausibly give rise to a particular encoding, and b) the aggregate encoding of data conforming to a desired structure, represented through the prior.","We characterise the decomposition of latent spaces in vaes to be the fulfilment of two factors (as shown in Figure 1):a.An “appropriate” level of overlap in the latent space—ensuring that the range of latent values capable of encoding a particular datapoint is neither too small, nor too large.This is, in general, dictated by the level of stochasticity in the encoder: the noisier the encoding process is, the higher the number of datapoints which can plausibly give rise to a particular encoding.b.The aggregate encoding q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) matching the prior p\left(\bm{z}\right), where the latter expresses the desired dependency structure between latents.

What is the effect of having larger values of β ?,Yes,"Large \beta is not universally beneficial for disentanglement, as the level of overlap can be increased too far. Increasing \beta can reinforce existing inductive biases, wherein mean-field assumptions encourage representations which reduce dependence between the latent dimensions. Increasing \beta increases the level of overlap in q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right), as a consequence of increasing the encoder variance for individual datapoints. When \beta is too large, the encoding of a datapoint loses meaning. overly large values of \beta actually cause a mismatch between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right) (see top right of Figure 3).","Taken together, this implies that the \beta-vae’s ability to encourage disentanglement is predominantly through direct control over the level of overlap.It places no other direct constraint on the latents to disentangle (although in some cases, the annealed prior may inadvertently encourage better disentanglement), but instead helps avoid the pitfalls of inappropriate overlap.Amongst other things, this explains why large \beta is not universally beneficial for disentanglement, as the level of overlap can be increased too far. It should be noted, however, that the value of \beta can indirectly influence the level of disentanglement when using a mean-field assumption for the encoder distribution (i.e. restricting S_{\phi}(x) to be diagonal).As noted by Stühmer et al. [52], Rolinek et al. [49], increasing \beta can reinforce existing inductive biases, wherein mean-field assumptions encourage representations which reduce dependence between the latent dimensions [55]. We see in Figure 3 that increasing \beta increases the level of overlap in q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right), as a consequence of increasing the encoder variance for individual datapoints.When \beta is too large, the encoding of a datapoint loses meaning.Also, as a single datapoint encodes to a Gaussian distribution, q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) is unable to match p\left(\bm{z}\right) exactly.Because q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right)\rightarrow q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) when \beta\rightarrow\infty, this in turn means thatoverly large values of \beta actually cause a mismatch between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right) (see top right of Figure 3).Increasing \alpha, instead always improved the match between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right).Here, the finiteness of the dataset and the choice of divergence results in an increase in overlap with increasing \alpha, but only up to the level required for a non-negligible overlap between the nearby datapoints: large values of \alpha did not cause the encodings to collapse to a mode."
Does β-VAE's objective control overlap ?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Yes.

According to the authors, the AI model's performance degrades quickly with longer, concatenated utterances, indicating that human performance may also decline when analyzing longer sequences","The \beta-vae objective to show that its contribution to disentangling is primarily through direct control of the level of overlap between encodings of the data, expressed by maximising the entropy of the encoding distribution. \beta-vae’s ability to encourage disentanglement is predominantly through direct control over the level of overlap. Hence, β-VAE's objective control overlap.","Taken together, this implies that the \beta-vae’s ability to encourage disentanglement is predominantly through direct control over the level of overlap.It places no other direct constraint on the latents to disentangle (although in some cases, the annealed prior may inadvertently encourage better disentanglement), but instead helps avoid the pitfalls of inappropriate overlap.Amongst other things, this explains why large \beta is not universally beneficial for disentanglement, as the level of overlap can be increased too far. This shows that the \beta-vae objective does not directly encourage latent variables to take on meaningful representations when using the standard choice of an isotropic Gaussian prior.In fact, on its own, it encourages latent representations which match the true generative factors no more than it encourages any arbitrary rotation of these factors, with such rotations capable of exhibiting strong correlations between latents.This view is further supported by our empirical results (see Figure 2), where we did not observe any gains in disentanglement (using the metric from Kim and Mnih [25]) from increasing \beta>0 with an isotropic Gaussian prior trained on the 2D Shapes dataset [38].It may also go some way to explaining the extremely high levels of variation we found in the disentanglement-metric scores between different random seeds at train time. Given the characterisation set out above, we now develop an objective that incorporates the effect of both factors (a) and (b).Our analysis of the \beta-vae tells us that its objective allows direct control over the level of overlap, i.e. factor Item a.To incorporate direct control over the regularisation Item b between the marginal posterior and the prior, we add a divergence term \mathbb{D}(q_{{\phi}}\left(z\right),p(\bm{z})), yielding\displaystyle\begin{split}\mathcal{L}_{\alpha,\beta}&(\bm{x})=\operatorname{{}\mathbb{E}}_{q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\mid\bm{x}\right)}\left[\log p_{{\theta}}\left(\bm{x}\mid\bm{z}\right)\right]\\&-\beta~{}\operatorname{\scalebox{0.95}{\text{KL}}}\left(q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\mid\bm{x}\right)\,\|\;p(\bm{z})\right)-\alpha~{}\mathbb{D}(q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right),p(\bm{z}))\end{split}(7)allowing control over how much factors (a) and (b) are enforced, through appropriate setting of \beta and \alpha respectively. Connecting prior work on disentanglement to this framework, we analysed the \beta-vae objective to show that its contribution to disentangling is primarily through direct control of the level of overlap between encodings of the data, expressed by maximising the entropy of the encoding distribution.In the commonly encountered case of assuming an isotropic Gaussian prior and an independent Gaussian posterior, we showed that control of overlap is the only effect of the \beta-vae.Motivated by this observation, we developed an alternate objective for the elbo that allows control of the two factors of decomposability through an additional regularisation term.We then conducted empirical evaluations using this objective, targeting alternate forms of decompositions such as clustering and sparsity, and observed the effect of varying the extent of regularisation to the prior on the quality of the resulting clustering and sparseness of the learnt embeddings.The results indicate that we were successful in attaining those decompositions. To connect our framework with existing approaches for encouraging disentanglement, we provide a theoretical analysis of the \beta-vae [17, 3, 2], and show that it typically only allows control of latent overlap, the first decomposition factor.We show that it can be interpreted, up to a constant offset, as the standard vae objective with its prior annealed as p_{{\theta}}\left(\bm{z}\right)^{\beta} and an additional maximum entropy regularization of the encoder that increases the stochasticity of the encodings.Specialising this result for the typical choice of a Gaussian encoder and isotropic Gaussian prior indicates that the \beta-vae, up to a scaling of the latent space, is equivalent to the vae plus a regulariser encouraging higher encoder variance.Moreover, this objective is invariant to rotations of the learned latent representation, meaning that it does not, on its own, encourage the latent variables to take on meaningful representations any more than an arbitrary rotation of them."
What is the purpose of using a non-isotropic Gaussian prior in the VAE model?,"A 10-class handwritten digit dataset introduced by LeCun et al. in 1998, widely used in deep learning and still popular today despite calls for its replacement","the purpose of using a non-isotropic Gaussian prior in the VAE model is to get better disentanglement scores, with further improvement achieved when the prior variance is learnt","Figure 2 demonstrates that notable improvements in disentanglement can be achieved by using non-isotropic priors:for a given reconstruction loss, implicitly fixed by \beta, non-isotropic Gaussian priors got better disentanglement scores, with further improvement achieved when the prior variance is learnt.With a product of Student-t priors p_{\nu}(\bm{z}) (noting p_{\nu}(\bm{z})\rightarrow\mathcal{N}(\bm{z};\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}) as \nu\rightarrow\infty), reducing \nu only incurred a minor reconstruction penalty, for improved disentanglement.Interestingly,very low values of \nu caused the disentanglement score to drop again (though still giving higher values than the Gaussian).We speculate that this may be related to the effect of heavy tails on the disentanglement metric itself, rather than being an objectively worse disentanglement.Another interesting result was that for an isotropic Gaussian prior, as per the original \beta-vae setup, no gains at all were achieved in disentanglement by increasing \beta."
How controlling the variance specifically affects the level of overlap?,"No, the authors did not try other interpolation methods besides the bilinear sampling mechanism",Controlling the variance is effective means of achieving the desired overlap behaviour. Increasing variance increases level of overlap.,"We see in Figure 3 that increasing \beta increases the level of overlap in q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right), as a consequence of increasing the encoder variance for individual datapoints.When \beta is too large, the encoding of a datapoint loses meaning.Also, as a single datapoint encodes to a Gaussian distribution, q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) is unable to match p\left(\bm{z}\right) exactly.Because q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right)\rightarrow q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) when \beta\rightarrow\infty, this in turn means thatoverly large values of \beta actually cause a mismatch between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right) (see top right of Figure 3).Increasing \alpha, instead always improved the match between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right).Here, the finiteness of the dataset and the choice of divergence results in an increase in overlap with increasing \alpha, but only up to the level required for a non-negligible overlap between the nearby datapoints: large values of \alpha did not cause the encodings to collapse to a mode. However, when the encoder is unimodal with fixed form (in particularly the tail behaviour is fixed) and the prior is well-characterised by Euclidean distances, then these factors have a substantially reduced ability to vary for a given I(\bm{x};\bm{z}), which subsequently becomes a good characterisation of the level of overlap.When q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) is Gaussian, controlling the variance of q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) (with a fixed q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right)) should similarly provide an effective means of achieving the desired overlap behaviour.As this is the most common use case, we leave the development of more a general definition of overlap to future work, simply noting that this is an important consideration when using flexible encoder distributions."
How does the form of the encoding distribution affect the ability to uncover true generative factors in VAEs?,"The probability vector shows sensitivity towards the noise in input because the pretrained DNN has learned to recognize useful partial information, such as faces, text, and other objects, even if they are not explicitly present in the training set. These detectors are robust to small input changes and can be observed in the lower layers of the network","The exact form of the encoding distribution affect the ability to uncover true generative factors in VAEs. If we restrict the encoder variance to be isotropic and then use a two dimensional prior where one latent dimension has a much larger variance than the other.It will be possible to store more information in the prior dimension with higher variance. Consequently, that dimension is more likely to correspond to an important factor of the generative process than the other. However it cannot be concluded that form of encoding is a true factor of variation in generative process and choosing encoding distribution arbitrarily is a good choice.","The exact form of the encoding distribution is also important here.For example, imagine we restrict the encoder variance to be isotropic and then use a two dimensional prior where one latent dimension has a much larger variance than the other.It will be possible to store more information in the prior dimension with higher variance (as we can spread points out more relative to the encoder variance).Consequently, that dimension is more likely to correspond to an important factor of the generative process than the other.Of course, this does not imply that this is a true factor of variation in the generative process, but neither is the meaning that can be attributed to each dimension completely arbitrary."
What is the role of encoding noise and the likelihood distribution in VAE representations?,"Autokeras is an automated machine learning (AutoML) library that helps in finding the best model architecture and hyperparameters for a given problem. It works by automatically searching through a wide range of possible architectures and hyperparameters, and evaluating their performance using a validation set. The best model is then selected based on its performance. In the context of the study, Autokeras was used to find the best model for image classification, and it selected a model with 3 hidden layers, as described in the passage","In VAE representation, the encoding noise forces nearby encodings to relate to similar datapoints, while standard choices for the likelihood distribution ensure that information is stored in the encodings, not just in the generative network","In concurrently published work, Locatello et al. [34] question the plausibility of learning unsupervised disentangled representations with meaningful features, based on theoretical analyses showing an equivalence class of generative models, many members of which could be entangled.Though their analysis is sound, we posit a counterargument to their conclusions, based on the stochastic nature of the encodings used during training.Namely, that this stochasticity means that they need not give rise to the same elbo scores (an important exception is the rotational invariance for isotropic Gaussian priors).Essentially, the encoding noise forces nearby encodings to relate to similar datapoints, while standard choices for the likelihood distribution (e.g. assuming conditional independence) ensure that information is stored in the encodings, not just in the generative network.These restrictions mean that the elbo prefers smooth representations and, provided the prior is not rotationally invariant, means that there no longer need be a class of different representations with the same elbo; simpler representations are preferred to more complex ones."
