How do these automated metrics for human preferences differ and what factors do they consider when predicting human preferences?,"These automated metrics for human preferences, such as BERTScore, BLEURT, and summarization preferences, differ in the factors they consider when predicting human preferences. While earlier metrics like BLEU and METEOR rely solely on linguistic features, the newer metrics incorporate human feedback and preferences, such as fluency and coherence, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of language quality","The automated metrics that are mentioned while discussing related work are BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019), BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020), and Ouyang et al (2022). More information on these automated metrics, including the differences between them, can probably be gleaned by reading these cited works. The current paper does not contain any additional information about these related automated metrics.","The ultimate aim of language technology is to interact with humans.However, most language models are trained without direct signals of human preference,with supervised target strings serving as (a sometimes crude) proxy.One option to incorporate user feedback is via human-in-the-loop, i.e., a user would be expected to provide feedback for each sample online as the model trains, but this degree of dense supervision is often prohibitive and inefficient.Automated metrics offer a promising compromise: learned models of human preference like BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019), BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020), summarization preferences (Wu et al., 2021) have significantly improved correlation with human judgment compared to earlier metrics (BLEU, METEOR, etc.), and are cheap to evaluate. But — these functions are usually not per-token differentiable: like humans, metrics can only offer quality estimates for full generations.Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a natural path forward for optimizing non-differentiable, scalar objectives for LM-based generation when it is cast as a sequential decision-making problem. However, Goodhart’s Law222Strathern (1997) paraphrases: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.looms: particularly in the case of imperfect metrics that use neural networks, it is easy to find nonsense samples that achieve high-quality estimates. Recent works have shown promising results in aligning LMs to human preferences via RL by constraining preference-based rewards to incorporate notions of fluency (Wu et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022) but progress in this line of work is heavily hindered by a lack of open-source benchmarks and algorithmic implementations—resulting in perception that RL is a challenging paradigm for NLP (Choshen et al., 2020; Kreutzer et al., 2021)."
What does non-differentiable mean here? If the problem with previous metrics is that they are not per-token differentiable then why are they looking for a way to optimize non-differentiable objectives?,"Non-differentiable here refers to the fact that the metrics used to evaluate the quality of generated text, such as BERTScore, BLEURT, and summarization preferences, are not differentiable at the individual token level. Instead, they provide a single quality estimate for a full generation of text. This makes it difficult to optimize these metrics using traditional reinforcement learning methods, which rely on differentiability to update model parameters. The authors are looking for a way to optimize non-differentiable objectives using reinforcement learning despite this limitation","A formal definition of non-differentiability has not been provided by the authors. However, authors in this context use this idea of differentiability to explain that most automated metrics cannot provide quality estimates after a language model generates one token or a parietal output - similar to humans, they can provide quality estimates only after a language model generates a full sequence. This non-differentiability is pointed out as a problem by the authors for the new metrics (i.e. things like BLUERT or BERTScore) - it is unclear from this paper alone if previous vanilla metrics (i.e. BLEU) were per token differentiable or not. The authors are looking for ways to use these non-differentiable scores in RL frameworks, potentially as a reward function.","The ultimate aim of language technology is to interact with humans.However, most language models are trained without direct signals of human preference,with supervised target strings serving as (a sometimes crude) proxy.One option to incorporate user feedback is via human-in-the-loop, i.e., a user would be expected to provide feedback for each sample online as the model trains, but this degree of dense supervision is often prohibitive and inefficient.Automated metrics offer a promising compromise: learned models of human preference like BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019), BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020), summarization preferences (Wu et al., 2021) have significantly improved correlation with human judgment compared to earlier metrics (BLEU, METEOR, etc.), and are cheap to evaluate.

"Why is the action space of language modeling particularly large? Is it because of the vocab size? But then, moving in the real world also has a huge action space (degrees of movement).","No, the action space of language modeling is not solely due to the vocabulary size. While the vocabulary size is a contributing factor, the action space is larger because of the inherent structure of language.

In language modeling, the action space includes not only the vocabulary size but also the order and sequence of tokens. This means that the number of possible actions is exponentially larger than the vocabulary size, making it challenging to learn and optimize policies.

In contrast, the action space in the real world, such as degrees of movement, is discrete and finite, making it easier to learn and optimize policies. Therefore, the action space of language modeling is particularly large due to the inherent structure of language, rather than just the vocabulary size","The action space for language modeling is equal to the vocabulary set of language models. Since the vocabularies are very large (i.e. tens of thousands of possible tokens), the action space is also very large. In general, locomotion in the real world can be condensed to three quantities - moving across X, Y or Z axes, or a linear combination thereof. The authors mention that typical RL problems have an action space that is an order of magnitude smaller, but do not specifically explain how the action spaces for typical problems is modeled or constructed.","Language generation action spaces are orders of magnitude larger than what most discrete action space RL algorithms are designed for (Ranzato et al., 2015; Ammanabrolu, 2021), e.g., GPT-2/3 and T5 have a vocabulary size of 50K and 32K respectively.We hypothesize that the size of the action space is a core cause of instability when training LMs with existing RL methods.To address this issue, we introduce NLPO (Natural Language Policy Optimization), which is inspired by work on action elimination/invalid-action masking (Zahavy et al., 2018; Huang & Ontañón, 2020; Ammanabrolu & Hausknecht, 2020). NLPO, a parameterized-masked extension of PPO, learns to mask out less relevant tokens in-context as it trains. NLPO accomplishes this via top-p sampling, which restricts tokens to the smallest possible set whose cumulative probability is greater than the probability parameter p (Holtzman et al., 2018). RL for Large Action Spaces. MIXER (Ranzato et al., 2015) combined ideas from schedule sampling and REINFORCE (Williams, 1992).Bahdanau et al. (2016) proposed an actor-critic algorithm to address the variance/large action space problems when using REINFORCE for language generation; follow-up works such asKG-A2C (Ammanabrolu & Hausknecht, 2020), TrufLL (Martin et al., 2022), AE-DQN (Zahavy et al., 2018), and GALAD (Ammanabrolu et al., 2022) addressed similar issues by attempting to eliminate and reduce the action space during exploration. Each environment is an NLP task: we are given a supervised dataset \mathcal{D}=\{({\bm{x}}^{i},{\bm{y}}^{i})\}_{i=1}^{N} of N examples, where {\bm{x}}\in\mathcal{X} is an language input and {\bm{y}}\in\mathcal{Y} is the target string. Generation can be viewed as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) \langle\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},\mathcal{R},P,\gamma,T\rangle using a finite vocabulary \mathcal{V}.Each episode in the MDP begins by sampling a datapoint ({\bm{x}},{\bm{y}}) from our dataset and ends when the current time step t exceeds the horizon T or an end of sentence (EOS) token is generated.The input {\bm{x}}=(x_{0},\cdots,x_{m}) is a task-specific prompt that is used as our initial state \bm{s}_{0}=(x_{0},\cdots,x_{m}), where \bm{s}_{0}\in\mathcal{S} and \mathcal{S} is the state space with x_{m}\in\mathcal{V}. An action in the environment a_{t}\in\mathcal{A} consists of a token from our vocabulary \mathcal{V}. The transition function P:\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{S} deterministically appends an action a_{t} to the end of the state \bm{s}_{t-1}=(x_{0},\cdots,x_{m},a_{0},\cdots,a_{t-1}). This continues until the end of the horizon t\leq T and we obtain a state \bm{s}_{T}=(x_{0},\cdots,x_{m},a_{0},\cdots,a_{T}).At the end of an episode a reward \mathcal{R}:\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{Y}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{1} that depends on the (\bm{s}_{T},{\bm{y}}) (e.g., an automated metric like PARENT Dhingra et al. (2019)) is emitted. RL4LMs provides an OpenAI gym (Brockman et al., 2016) styleAPI for an RL environmentthat simulates this LM-Based MDP formulation.Abstracting the details of the MDP environment structure allows for new tasks to be added quickly with compatibility across all implemented algorithms."
What do the equations for Q-value and value represent?,"The equations for Q-value and value represent the expected return or value of taking a particular action in a particular state, and the expected return or value of taking any action in any state, respectively.

Specifically, the Q-value equation, Q_t^π(s_t, a_t) = R(s_t, a_t, y) + γ \* E_s[V_t^π(s_t+1)], represents the expected return of taking action a_t in state s_t and then following policy π thereafter, where E_s[ ] represents the expected value over the next state distribution.

The value equation, V_t^π(s_t) = E_a[Q_t^π(s_t, a_t)], represents the expected value of taking any action in state s_t, where E_a[ ] represents the expected value over all possible actions","Q and V are mathematically expressed as: V_{t}^{\pi}=\mathbb{E}_{a_{t}\sim\pi}[\sum_{\tau=t}^{T}\gamma R(\bm{s}_{\tau},a_{\tau},{\bm{y}})],Q_{t}^{\pi}(\bm{s}_{t},a_{t})=R(\bm{s}_{t},a_{t},{\bm{y}})+\gamma\mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1}\sim P}[V_{t+1}^{\pi}(\bm{s}_{t+1})] where R is the reward function, s means states, and the variable 'a' denotes actions. Further information on what these values mean, or their interpretation is not found in this paper.","RL4LMs supports fine-tuning and training LMs from scratch via on-policy actor-critic algorithms on language environments.Formally, this class of algorithms allows us to train a parameterized control policy defined as \pi_{\theta}:\mathcal{S}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}, a function that attempts to select an action in a given state so as to maximize long term discounted rewards over a trajectory \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[\sum_{t=0}^{T}\gamma^{t}\mathcal{R}(\bm{s}_{t},a_{t})].Our benchmark experiments focus on fine-tuning a pre-trained LM denoted as \pi_{0} from which we initial our agent’s policy \pi_{\theta}=\pi_{0}.Similarly, the value network V_{\phi} used to estimate the value function is also initialized from \pi_{0} except for the final layer which is randomly initialized to output a single scalar value.As with other deep RL actor-critic algorithms, we define our value and Q-value functions as V_{t}^{\pi}=\mathbb{E}_{a_{t}\sim\pi}[\sum_{\tau=t}^{T}\gamma R(\bm{s}_{\tau},a_{\tau},{\bm{y}})],Q_{t}^{\pi}(\bm{s}_{t},a_{t})=R(\bm{s}_{t},a_{t},{\bm{y}})+\gamma\mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1}\sim P}[V_{t+1}^{\pi}(\bm{s}_{t+1})]leading to a definition of our advantage function as A_{t}^{\pi}(\bm{s},a)=Q_{t}^{\pi}(\bm{s},a)-V_{t}^{\pi}.To increase training stability, advantage is appoximated using Generalized Advantage Estimation (Schulman et al., 2015)."
Why is it helpful to mask out less relevant tokens if these are less likely to be sampled anyways?,Masking out less relevant tokens helps the model learn more task-relevant information and avoid reward hacking,"The authors hypothesize that their dynamic masking function helps because it adds a new constraint that the RL algorithm has to abide by. Additionally, since this is a dynamic function, being updated oftenly (every mu steps), it is likely that the masking function ensures that the selected top-p tokens are more relevant to the current state the RL algorithm needs to analyse and decide on.","Specifically, NLPOmaintains a masking policy \pi_{\psi}: the masking policy is a copy of the current policy (\pi_{\theta}), but is updated only every \mu steps.A parameterized-invalid-mask is created from \pi_{\psi} by first selecting the top-p tokens from the vocabulary,444\pi_{\psi} could be trained with alternate sampling techniques like top-k or beam search (or even hard-coded via rules by domain experts), though we find top-p sampling to be most effective in practice. and then applying an invalid-mask to the remaining tokens—i.e. setting their probabilities to zero when sampling actions from \pi_{\theta} during training;this periodic updating policy \pi_{\psi} is inspired by off-policy Q-learning algorithms (Andrychowicz et al., 2017),providing the policy \pi_{\theta} with an additional constraint that balances between the benefits of containing more task relevant information than the KL penalty derived from \pi_{0} and the risk of reward hacking.We provide pseudocode in Algorithm 1 (green portions highlight the differences with PPO). PPO vs. NLPO.Figure 2 shows that NLPO generally outperforms PPO and supervised, especially when applied after supervised training.We hypothesize that the primary reason for NLPO’s improved performance and stability is because the masking policy provides an additional constraint for the current policy.This constraint is not based on the initial untuned policy like the KL penalty but of the policy from \mu iterations ago and likely contains more task-relevant information learned during RL training.Table 3 (and Appendix Table 8) shows how performance increases up to a point and then decreases as p in top-p sampling is increased for the masking policy, relaxing the constraint by eliminating less tokens at each step, implying that there is a balance to be found in how much the model should be constrained during RL training."
Why is the masking policy only updated every certain number of steps?,To balance between the benefits of containing task-relevant information and the risk of reward hacking,"The authors mention that they update the masking function every ""mu"" steps, but the main text of the paper itself does not appear to contain the exact value of mu itself - there is a possibility that the author's model could work with mu=1 instead (i.e. update every step) instead of updating it every couple of steps (i.e. mu > 1), though the authors do not explain in this paper if this were done. However, the authors mention that one reason why NLPO outperforms PPO is probably because of this dynamic masking function that is updated occasionally - this indicates to us that mu is probably not an unbounded or very large number (if mu were very large, tending to infinity, the function would no longer be dynamic).","Language generation action spaces are orders of magnitude larger than what most discrete action space RL algorithms are designed for (Ranzato et al., 2015; Ammanabrolu, 2021), e.g., GPT-2/3 and T5 have a vocabulary size of 50K and 32K respectively.We hypothesize that the size of the action space is a core cause of instability when training LMs with existing RL methods.To address this issue, we introduce NLPO (Natural Language Policy Optimization), which is inspired by work on action elimination/invalid-action masking (Zahavy et al., 2018; Huang & Ontañón, 2020; Ammanabrolu & Hausknecht, 2020).

How did the token-masking policy help in the results?,"The token-masking policy helped by providing an additional constraint for the current policy, not based on the initial untuned policy like the KL penalty, but of the policy from \mu iterations ago, likely containing more task-relevant information learned during RL training","The use of token-masking policy in the proposed method (NLPO) is theorized by the authors to have been a key reason on why it was able to outperform the PPO based model. They hypothesized that their masking function acts as a dynamic constraint added to the algorithm, that is able to more effectively filter and capture relevant information about the state thanks to its' dynamic nature.","Specifically, NLPOmaintains a masking policy \pi_{\psi}: the masking policy is a copy of the current policy (\pi_{\theta}), but is updated only every \mu steps.A parameterized-invalid-mask is created from \pi_{\psi} by first selecting the top-p tokens from the vocabulary,444\pi_{\psi} could be trained with alternate sampling techniques like top-k or beam search (or even hard-coded via rules by domain experts), though we find top-p sampling to be most effective in practice. and then applying an invalid-mask to the remaining tokens—i.e. setting their probabilities to zero when sampling actions from \pi_{\theta} during training;this periodic updating policy \pi_{\psi} is inspired by off-policy Q-learning algorithms (Andrychowicz et al., 2017),providing the policy \pi_{\theta} with an additional constraint that balances between the benefits of containing more task relevant information than the KL penalty derived from \pi_{0} and the risk of reward hacking.We provide pseudocode in Algorithm 1 (green portions highlight the differences with PPO).

What is the combinatorial action space? How is this different to general RL tasks? Are they not combinatorial?,"The combinatorial action space is the set of all possible sequences of tokens that can be generated by the language model, which is orders of magnitude larger than the action spaces of most discrete action space RL algorithms. This is different from general RL tasks, which typically have a finite set of discrete actions. In the context of language generation, the action space is not just a set of discrete actions, but rather a continuous space of possible sequences of tokens","The combinatorial action space here probably refers to the set of all possible actions that a RL agent for optimizing a language model could possibly take - here, the action set consists of the entire vocabulary of the language model, which can range to tens of thousands for typical GPT/T5 models used today. This is unlike general RL tasks, where the action space is an order of magnitude smaller.","Language generation action spaces are orders of magnitude larger than what most discrete action space RL algorithms are designed for (Ranzato et al., 2015; Ammanabrolu, 2021), e.g., GPT-2/3 and T5 have a vocabulary size of 50K and 32K respectively.We hypothesize that the size of the action space is a core cause of instability when training LMs with existing RL methods.To address this issue, we introduce NLPO (Natural Language Policy Optimization), which is inspired by work on action elimination/invalid-action masking (Zahavy et al., 2018; Huang & Ontañón, 2020; Ammanabrolu & Hausknecht, 2020).

"For the images used for visualization in the paper, were they selected randomly or picked by the authors?","The images were not selected randomly, but were picked by the authors","Authors best practices were to combine effects of different ways of regularization to produce interpretable images. They first search randomly through 300 different combinations of  hyperparameters, then they pick the best four sets of hyperparameters that are compliments to each other and then these sets would be used to visualize preferred images for different classes.","If the above regularization methods are applied individually, they aresomewhat effective at producing more interpretable images; Figure 3 shows the effects of each individual hyperparameter.However, preliminary experiments uncovered that their combinedeffect produces better visualizations. To pick a reasonable set ofhyperparameters for all methods at once, we ran a randomhyperparameter search of 300 possible combinations and settled on fourthat complement each other well. The four selected combinations arelisted in Table 1 and optimized images using each are shown for the “Gorilla” class output unit in Figure 4. Of the four, some show highfrequency information, others low frequency; some contain densepixel data, and others contain only sparse outlines of importantregions.We found the version in the lower-left quadrant to be the best single set of hyperparameters, but often greater intuition canbe gleaned by considering all four at once.Figure 5 shows the optimization results computed for a selection of units on all layers. A single image for every filter of all five convolutional layers is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Nine images for each filter of all layers, including each of the 1000 ImageNet output classes, can be viewed at http://yosinski.com/deepvis."
Does the paper's DNN use a a larger width kernel or multiple smaller width kernels? ,Multiple smaller width kernels,The paper's DNN uses multiple smaller Gaussian kernels iteratively as a way of regularization during the optimization process as seen in equation 2 .,"Gaussian blur: Producing images via gradient ascent tends to produce examples with high frequency information (see Supplementary Section S1 for a possible reason). While these images cause high activations, they are neither realistic nor interpretable (Nguyen et al., 2014). A useful regularization is thus to penalize high frequency information. We implement this as a Gaussian blur step rθ (x) = GaussianBlur(x, θb width). Convolving with a blur kernel is more computationally expensive than the other regularization methods, so we added another hyperparameter θb every to allow, for example, blurring every several optimization steps instead of every step. Blurring an image multiple times with a small width Gaussian kernel is equivalent to blurring once with a larger width kernel, and the effect will be similar even if the image changes slightly during the optimization process. This technique thus lowers computational costs without limiting the expressiveness of the regularization. Mahendran & Vedaldi (2014) used a penalty with a similar effect to blurring, called total variation, in their work reconstructing images from layer codes."
Why did the authors choose the four particular regularizations instead of others?,"The authors chose the four regularizations because they address different pathologies in deep learning, specifically high frequency information, extreme pixel values, and non-zero activations in non-discriminative regions. These regularizations help improve the interpretability and realism of the generated images, and they are designed to overcome limitations in previous generative models","Authors mainly introduce four different and newly used regularizations that would help researchers in visualizing responses from different layers. These regularizations are designed to overcome different pathologies commonly encountered by gradient descent without regularization : L2 decay to penalize large pixel values which do not naturally occur, Gaussian blur:a useful regularization to iteratively penalize high frequency information associated with generated images via gradient ascent through each optimization step, Clipping pixels with small norm or Clipping pixels with small contribution.","We investigated the following four regularizations. All are designed to overcome different pathologies commonly encountered by gradient descent without regularization. Gaussian blur: Producing images via gradient ascent tends to produce examples with high frequency information (see Supplementary Section S1 for a possible reason). While these images cause high activations, they are neither realistic nor interpretable (Nguyen et al., 2014). A useful regularization is thus to penalize high frequency information. We implement this as a Gaussian blur step r_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})=\mathrm{GaussianBlur}(\mathbf{x},\theta_{\mathrm{b\_width}}). Convolving with a blur kernel is more computationally expensive than the other regularization methods, so we added another hyperparameter \theta_{\mathrm{b\_every}} to allow, for example, blurring every several optimization steps instead of every step. Blurring an image multiple times with a small width Gaussian kernel is equivalent to blurring once with a larger width kernel, and the effect will be similar even if the image changes slightly during the optimization process. This technique thus lowers computational costs without limiting the expressiveness of the regularization. Mahendran & Vedaldi (2014) used a penalty with a similar effect to blurring, called total variation, in their work reconstructing images from layer codes. The second tool — new regularizations that enable improved, interpretable, optimized visualizations of learned features — will help researchers and practitioners understand, debug, and improve their models. The visualizations also reveal a new twist in an ongoing story. Previous studieshave shown that discriminative networks can easily be fooled or hacked by the addition of certain structurednoise in image space (Szegedy et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2014).An oft-cited reason for this property is that discriminative training leads networksto ignore non-discriminative information in their input, e.g. learning to detect jaguars by matching the unique spots on their fur while ignoring the fact that they have four legs. For this reason it has been seen as a hopeless endeavor to create a generative model in which one randomly samples an x from a broad distribution on the space of all possible imagesand then iteratively transforms x into a recognizable image by moving it to a region that satisfies both a prior p(x) and posterior p(y|x) for some class label y.Past attempts have largely supported this view by producing unrealistic images using this method (Nguyen et al., 2014; Simonyan et al., 2013). Paragraph 10 : L2 decay: A common regularization, L2 decay penalizes large values and is implemented as rθ (x) = (1−θdecay)·x. L2 decay tends to prevent a small number of extreme pixel values from dominating the example image. Such extreme single-pixel values neither occur naturally with great frequency nor are useful for visualization. Paragraph 11 :Clipping pixels with small norm: The first two regularizations suppress high amplitude and high frequency information, so after applying both, we are left with an x∗ that contains somewhat small, somewhat smooth values. However, x∗ will still tend to contain non-zero pixel values everywhere. Even if some pixels in x∗ show the primary object or type of input causing the unit under consideration to activate, the gradient with respect to all other pixels in x∗ will still generally be non-zero, so these pixels will also shift to show some pattern as well, contributing in whatever small way they can to ultimately raise the chosen unit’s activation. We wish to bias the search away from such behavior and instead show only the main object, letting other regions be exactly zero if they are not needed. Paragraph 12 : Clipping pixels with small contribution: Instead of clipping pixels with small norms, we can try something slightly smarter and clip pixels with small contributions to the activation."
"What is meant by ""linear sweep"" in hyperparameter space?","A linear sweep in hyperparameter space refers to a gradual increase or decrease in the value of a hyperparameter, starting from a minimum or maximum value, respectively, and ending at the opposite extreme",linear sweep can be seen as a regular increment in the values of some regularization hyperparameter (from leftmost where there is no regularization to rightmost where strong regularization occur ) to see the variation of their effects on the corresponding activations.,"Figure 3. The effects of each regularization method from Section 3 when used individually. Each of the four rows shows a linear sweep in hyperparameter space from no regularization (left) to strong regularization (right). When applied too strongly, some regularizations cause the optimization to fail (e.g. L2 decay, top row) or the images to be less interpretable (small norm and small contribution clipping, bottom two rows). For this reason, a random hyperparameter search was useful for finding joint hyperparameter settings that worked well together (see Figure 4). Best viewed electronically, zoomed in."
What are the examples of the tools that enable understanding of Neural Networks for newcomers in deep learning? ,"The first tool is software that interactively plots the activations produced on each layer of a trained DNN for user-provided images or video, allowing for a slow, detailed investigation of a particular input. The second tool is new regularizations that enable improved, interpretable visualizations of learned features","The paper talked about two main tools; the first is a software tool to plot activations of each trained layer of a network, for images or videos. Second is introducing new regularization ways to help with understanding learned features through network.These tools are supposed to help newcomers in deep learning to have better intuitions for hidden interpretations of well known structures and give motivations for more new ideas.","The first tool is software that interactively plots the activations produced on each layer of a trained DNN for user-provided images or video. Static images afford a slow, detailed investigation of a particular input, whereas video input highlights the DNNs changing responses to dynamic input. At present, the videos are processed live from a user’s computer camera, which is especially helpful because users can move different items around the field of view, occlude and combine them, and perform other manipulations to actively learn how different features in the network respond. The second tool — new regularizations that enable improved, interpretable, optimized visualizations of learned features — will help researchers and practitioners understand, debug, and improve their models. The visualizations also reveal a new twist in an ongoing story. Previous studieshave shown that discriminative networks can easily be fooled or hacked by the addition of certain structurednoise in image space (Szegedy et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2014).An oft-cited reason for this property is that discriminative training leads networksto ignore non-discriminative information in their input, e.g. learning to detect jaguars by matching the unique spots on their fur while ignoring the fact that they have four legs. For this reason it has been seen as a hopeless endeavor to create a generative model in which one randomly samples an x from a broad distribution on the space of all possible imagesand then iteratively transforms x into a recognizable image by moving it to a region that satisfies both a prior p(x) and posterior p(y|x) for some class label y.Past attempts have largely supported this view by producing unrealistic images using this method (Nguyen et al., 2014; Simonyan et al., 2013)."
How did the authors compute the contributions of the pixels in order to clip the pixels with smaller contributions?,"The authors computed the contributions of the pixels using the absolute value of the elementwise product of the gradient and the input, and then used a threshold-based approach to clip pixels with smaller contributions","Calculating absolute difference between some neuron activation of an input and the activation for same input without certain pixel can be considered a way of measuring the contribution of that pixel in the total response of the neuron. To ensure faster computation, we can estimate activation near the input with 1st order approximation (linear) and hence this leads  to total contribution estimated as the element wise product of the activation gradient and the input x (each element in this product shows how this pixel affects the total response ), we repeat this product for all different channels ,sum them all, and take absolute value  to find pixels with small contribution in either direction, positive or negative to get rid of.","Clipping pixels with small contribution: Instead of clipping pixels with small norms, we can try something slightly smarter and clip pixels with small contributions to the activation. One way of computing a pixel’s contribution to an activation is to measure how much the activation increases or decreases when the pixel is set to zero; that is, to compute the contribution as |a_{i}(\mathbf{x})-a_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{-j})|, where \mathbf{x}_{-j} is \mathbf{x} but with the j^{th} pixel set to zero. This approach is straightforward but prohibitively slow, requiring a forward pass for every pixel. Instead, we approximate this process by linearizing a_{i}(\mathbf{x}) around \mathbf{x}, in which case the contribution of each dimension of \mathbf{x} can be estimated as the elementwise product of \mathbf{x} and the gradient. We then sum over all three channels and take the absolute value, computing \left|\sum_{c}\mathbf{x}\circ\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}a_{i}(\mathbf{x})\right|. We use the absolute value to find pixels with small contribution in either direction, positive or negative. While we could choose to keep the pixel transitions where setting the pixel to zero would result in a large activation increase, these shifts are already handled by gradient ascent, and here we prefer to clip only the pixels that are deemed not to matter, not to take large gradient steps outside the region where the linear approximation is most valid. We define this r_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) as the operation that sets pixels with contribution under the \theta_{\mathrm{c\_pct}} percentile to zero."
"How does a ""network-centric"" approach differ from a ""dataset-centric approach""?","A ""network-centric"" approach differs from a ""dataset-centric"" approach in that the former does not require any data from a dataset, while the latter requires both a trained DNN and running data through that network","""Dataset-centric approach"" requires the trained network together with some dataset  to run through the network showing high or low responses of different units while interacting with most significant images of such dataset. This approach can also use deconvolution layers and upsampling to map and highlight the regions of an image that were responsible of the firing of the different units.
""Network-centric approach"" deals only with network without the need to any dataset.You can start with some initial input, compute activations through the forward path and then compute gradients while backprop. You can then ascent or descent the input towards gradient until you reach a preferred input stimulus x* for the unit under consideration. Working with input images, you can visualize that x* if you want.","Another approach is to try to interpret the function computed by each individual neuron. Past studies in this vein roughly divide into two different camps: dataset-centric and network-centric. The former requires both a trained DNN and running data through that network; the latter requires only the trained network itself. One dataset-centric approach is to display images from the training or test set that cause high or low activations for individual units. Another is the deconvolution method of Zeiler & Fergus (2013), which highlights the portions of a particular image that are responsible for the firing of each neural unit. Network-centric approaches investigate a network directly without any data from a dataset. For example, Erhan et al. (2009) synthesized images that cause high activations for particular units. Starting with some initial input \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x_{0}}, the activation a_{i}(\mathbf{x}) caused at some unit i by this input is computed, and then steps are taken in input spacealong the gradient \partial a_{i}(\mathbf{x})/\partial\mathbf{x} to synthesize inputs that cause higher and higher activations of unit i, eventually terminating at some \mathbf{x^{*}} which is deemed to be a preferred input stimulus for the unit in question. In the case where the input space is an image, \mathbf{x^{*}} can be displayed directly for interpretation. Others have followed suit, using the gradient to find images that cause higher activations (Simonyan et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2014) or lower activations (Szegedy et al., 2013) for output units."

"What is meant by ""hacks""?","""hacks"" refer to extreme pixel values, structured high frequency patterns, and copies of common motifs without global structure that are used to cause high (or low) activations in neural networks, but do not greatly resemble natural images",'Hacks' means that they are not likely to naturally exist (non-natural looking images). However they may even cause harmful changes in the response of the network. Adversarial points for instance are examples of such hacks where slight increments in pixels of even correctly classified images can make them fool the network and tend to go beyond there original part of space and hence be misclassified.,"These gradient-based approaches are attractive in their simplicity, but the optimization process tends to produce images that do not greatly resemble natural images. Instead, they are composed of a collection of “hacks” that happen to cause high (or low) activations: extreme pixel values, structured high frequency patterns, and copies of common motifs without global structure (Simonyan et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2014; Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014). The fact that activations may be effected by such hacks is better understood thanks to several recent studies. Specifically, it has been shown that such hacks may be applied to correctly classified images to cause them to be misclassified even via imperceptibly small changes (Szegedy et al., 2013), that such hacks can be found even without the gradient information to produce unrecognizable “fooling examples” (Nguyen et al., 2014), and that the abundance of non-natural looking images that cause extreme activations can be explained by the locally linear behavior of neural nets(Goodfellow et al., 2014)."
"The paper's pre-trained network is nearly identical to the “AlexNet”. Does it use the same training set as the ""AlexNet""?","No, the paper's pre-trained network does not use the same training set as the ""AlexNet""","Yes both were trained on ImageNet 2012 dataset but paper's network first subtracted the per-pixel mean of examples in ImageNet before inputting training examples to the network.

While the tools could be adapted to integrate with any DNN software framework, they work out of the box withthe popular Caffe DNN software package (Jia et al., 2014).Users may run visualizations with their own Caffe DNN or our pre-trained DNN, which comes with pre-computed images optimized to activate each neuron in this trained network. Our pre-trained network is nearly identical to the “AlexNet” architecture (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), but with local reponse normalization layers after pooling layers following (Jia et al., 2014). It was trained with the Caffe framework on the ImageNet 2012 dataset (Deng et al., 2009). Our network was trained on ImageNet by first subtracting the per-pixel mean of examples in ImageNet before inputting training examples to the network.

"What is meant by ""row-major"" order?","Row-major order refers to the way the 256 small images are arranged in a 16x16 grid, with each image being placed in a row and then stacked on top of each other","""row-major"" means that consecutive small grayscale images of each row reside next to each other unlike ""column-major"" and both are methods of storing elements in memory.","Figure 1 shows examples of this type of plot for the \mathsf{conv5} layer.The \mathsf{conv5} layer has size 256\times13\times13, which we depict as 256 separate 13\times13 grayscale images. Each of the 256 small images contains activations in the same spatial x-y spatial layout as the input data, and the 256 images are simply and arbitrarily tiled into a 16\times16 grid in row-major order.Figure 2 shows a zoomed in view of one particular channel, \mathsf{conv5_{151}}, that responds to human and animal faces. All layers can be viewed in the software tool, including pooling and normalization layers. Visualizing these layers provides intuitions about their effects and functions."
"Why was a zero-centered input used for training the paper's DNN, instead of using the training images as input directly?",To avoid bias towards the mean of the input data,"Zero mean input data and Standardization in general improve the convergence properties of BP training, so it can help to reach desired solution fast. Also, Authors may intend to have centered inputs so that network reduces its biasing towards certain classes or certain large or tiny response values, hence we can have reasonable values for activations and more visualizable responses from different neurons.","Our network was trained on ImageNet by first subtracting the per-pixel mean of examples in ImageNet before inputting training examples to the network.

"For the paper's pretrained DNN, if the input does not contain a training set class, why does the probability vector show sensitivity towards the noise in input?","The probability vector shows sensitivity towards the noise in input because the pretrained DNN has learned to recognize useful partial information, such as faces, text, and other objects, even if they are not explicitly present in the training set. These detectors are robust to small input changes and can be observed in the lower layers of the network","The reason is that convolution layers learn parameters that can extract useful information and relations from the feature map that can help it afterwards to judge and give suitable responses of what this category is. Responses from learned detectors can resemble among some set of categories and can also differ among other set of categories. Input -not being in the training classes- still has a feature map that different layers would respond to according to those different detectors which the network has already learned and would still give a probability vector which may not be accurate. Hence, having noise in the input can stimulate different detectors to respond and fire different activations that would lead to changes in the probability output vector.","•One of the most interesting conclusions so far has been that representations on some layers seem to be surprisingly local. Instead of finding distributed representations on all layers, we see, for example, detectors for text, flowers, fruit, and faces on \mathsf{conv4} and \mathsf{conv5}. These conclusions can be drawn either from the live visualization or the optimized images (or, best, by using both in concert) and suggest several directions for future research (discussed in Section 4).•When using direct file input to classify photos from Flickr or Google Images, classifications are often correct and highly confident (softmax probability for correct class near 1). On the other hand, when using input from a webcam, predictions often cannot be correct because no items from the training set are shown in the image. The training set’s 1000 classes, though numerous, do not cover most common household objects. Thus, when shown a typical webcam view of a person with no ImageNet classes present, the output has no single high probability, as is expected. Surprisingly, however, this probability vector is noisy and varies significantly in response to tiny changes in the input, often changing merely in response to the noise from the webcam. We might have instead expected unchanging and low confidence predictions for a given scene when no object the network has been trained to classify is present. Plotting the fully connected layers (\mathsf{fc6} and \mathsf{fc7}) also reveals a similar sensitivity to small input changes.•Although the last three layers are sensitive to small input changes, much of the lower layer computation is more robust. For example, when visualizing the \mathsf{conv5} layer, one can find many invariant detectors for faces, shoulders, text, etc. by moving oneself or objects in front of the camera. Even though the 1000 classes contain no explicitly labeled faces or text, the network learns to identify these concepts simply because they represent useful partial information for making a later classification decision. One face detector, denoted \mathsf{conv5_{151}} (channel number 151 on \mathsf{conv5}), is shown in Figure 2 activating for human and lion faces and in Figure 1 activating for a cat face. Zhou et al. (2014) recently observed a similar effect where convnets trained only to recognize different scene types — playgrounds, restaurant patios, living rooms, etc. — learn object detectors (e.g. for chairs, books, and sofas) on intermediate layers."
"The paper wished to only show the main object , letting other regions be exactly zero if they are not needed. How did the authors achieve it?","By using an r_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) that sets any pixels with small norm to zero, based on a threshold \theta_{\mathrm{n\_pct}} specified as a percentile of all pixel norms in \mathbf{x}",The paper reaches this goal by calculating each pixel norm over the 3 colour channels and zeroing out small-norm pixels according to some threshold (the percentile of all pixel norms in x).,"Clipping pixels with small norm: The first two regularizations suppress high amplitude and high frequency information, so after applying both, we are left with an \mathbf{x^{*}} that contains somewhat small, somewhat smooth values. However, \mathbf{x^{*}} will still tend to contain non-zero pixel values everywhere. Even if some pixels in \mathbf{x^{*}} show the primary object or type of input causing the unit under consideration to activate, the gradient with respect to all other pixels in \mathbf{x^{*}} will still generally be non-zero, so these pixels will also shift to show some pattern as well, contributing in whatever small way they can to ultimately raise the chosen unit’s activation. We wish to bias the search away from such behavior and instead show only the main object, letting other regions be exactly zero if they are not needed. We implement this bias using an r_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) that computes the norm of each pixel (over red, green, and blue channels) and then sets any pixels with small norm to zero. The threshold for the norm, \theta_{\mathrm{n\_pct}}, is specified as a percentile of all pixel norms in \mathbf{x}."
How many hyperparameter combinations were used for the random hyperparameter search?,300,300 sets of possible hyperparameter combinations then choose four of them that complement each other well.,"If the above regularization methods are applied individually, they aresomewhat effective at producing more interpretable images; Figure 3 shows the effects of each individual hyperparameter.However, preliminary experiments uncovered that their combinedeffect produces better visualizations. To pick a reasonable set ofhyperparameters for all methods at once, we ran a randomhyperparameter search of 300 possible combinations and settled on fourthat complement each other well. The four selected combinations arelisted in Table 1 and optimized images using each are shown for the “Gorilla” class output unit in Figure 4. Of the four, some show highfrequency information, others low frequency; some contain densepixel data, and others contain only sparse outlines of importantregions.We found the version in the lower-left quadrant to be the best single set of hyperparameters, but often greater intuition canbe gleaned by considering all four at once.Figure 5 shows the optimization results computed for a selection of units on all layers. A single image for every filter of all five convolutional layers is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Nine images for each filter of all layers, including each of the 1000 ImageNet output classes, can be viewed at http://yosinski.com/deepvis."
The paper lists tools that enable understanding of neural networks for beginners. Have they mentioned the tools for expert users as well?,"Yes, the paper also mentions tools for expert users","They didn't mention specific tools for expert users. However, they have thoughts that even experts would benefit from their new ideas such as when experts iterate ideas for new models or while searching for good hyperparameters or maybe from intuitions about the inner workings of DNNs.","We also note that tools that enable understanding will especially benefit the vast numbers of newcomers to deep learning, who would like to take advantage of off-the-shelf software packages — like Theano (Bergstra et al., 2010), Pylearn2 (Goodfellow et al., 2013), Caffe (Jia et al., 2014), and Torch (Collobert et al., 2011) — in new domains, but who may not have any intuition for why their models work (or do not). Experts can also benefit as they iterate ideas for new models or when they are searching for good hyperparameters. We thus believe that both experts and newcomers will benefit from tools that provide intuitions about the inner workings of DNNs. This paper provides two such tools, both of which are open source so that scientists and practitioners can integrate them with their own DNNs to better understand them."
"The paper's model implies that the discriminative parameters also contain significant “generative” structure from the training dataset. What is meant by ""generative"" structure?","The ""generative"" structure refers to the ability of the model to generate realistic images, beyond just recognizing the training data","Generative structure is how the data is distributed inside the space where it lives, for example when learning to detect jaguar class, parameters encode not only the jaguar’s spots(Only to distinguish it through a rare property), but to some extent also its four legs(to learn the pattern with which the whole creature can be found). So, discriminative parameters also contain significant “generative” structure.","However, the results presented here suggest an alternate possibility: the previously used priors may simply have been too weak (see Section S1 for one hypothesis of why a strong p(x) model is needed). With the careful design or learning of a p(x) model that biases toward realism,one may be able to harnessthe large number of parameters present in a discriminately learned p(y|x) modelto generate realistic images by enforcing probability under both models simultaneously.Even with the simple, hand-coded p(x) models we use in this paper as regularizers, complex dependencies between distant pixels already arise (cf. the beetles with structure spanning over 100 pixels in Figure 4). This implies that the discriminative parameters also contain significant “generative” structure from thetraining dataset; that is, the parameters encodenot only the jaguar’s spots, but to some extent also its four legs.With better, learned probabilistic models over the input and activations of higher layers, much more structure may be apparent. Work by Dai et al. (2015) shows some interesting results in this direction.While the images generated in this paper are far from being photo-realistic, they do suggest thattransferring discriminatively trained parameters to generative models — opposite the direction of the usual unsupervised pretraining approach — may be a fruitful area for further investigation."
How does the performance change when a dense retriever is evaluated on out-of-domain queries and documents that are different from the domain on which the retriever was trained?,Poorly,"It is said that when evaluating a retriever trained on a source domain in an out-of-domain setting, the performance is obtained lower than BM25. Also, dense retrievers are said to be sensitive to domain shift and models that perform well on MS MARCO do not perform well on COVID-19 data. There have been many studies on unsupervised sentence embedding learning, but it is said that they do not work well in unsupervised dense retrieval. Therefore, the performance of the retriever in out-of-domain may be worse.","However, as shown in Thakur et al. (2021b), dense retrieval methods require large amounts of training data to work well.333For reference, the popular MS MARCO dataset (Nguyen et al., 2016) has about 500k training instances; the Natural Questions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) has more than 100k training instances.  Most importantly, dense retrieval methods are extremely sensitive to domain shifts: Models trained on MS MARCO perform rather poorly for questions for COVID-19 scientific literature (Wang et al., 2020; Voorhees et al., 2021). The MS MARCO dataset was created before COVID-19, hence, it does not include any COVID-19 related topics and models did not learn how to represent this topic well in a vector space. We use the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset Nguyen et al. (2016) as the data from the source domain. It has 8.8M passages and 532.8K query-passage pairs labeled as relevant in the training set. As Table 1 shows, a state-of-the-art dense retrieval model, achieving an MRR@10 of 33.2 points on the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset, performs poorly on the six selected domain-specific retrieval datasets when compared to simple BM25 lexical search. So far, ICT and CD have only been studied on in-domain performance, i.e. a large in-domain labeled dataset is available which is used for subsequent supervised fine-tuning. SimCSE, CT, and TSDAE have been only studied for unsupervised sentence embedding learning. As our results show in Appendix E, they do not work at all for purely unsupervised dense retrieval. If these pre-training approaches can be used for unsupervised domain adaptation for dense retrieval was so far unclear. In this work, we transfer the setup from Wang et al. (2021) to dense retrieval and first pre-train on the target corpus, followed by supervised training on labeled data from MS MARCO Nguyen et al. (2016). Performance is then measured on the target corpus."
"What kinds of relevant documents are missing, when lexical matching is used for retrieval?","Sure! Here's the answer to the question based on the provided context:

Documents that contain synonyms or ambiguous words that are not recognized by lexical matching methods",Using lexical matching makes it difficult to identify synonyms or to distinguish between ambiguous words.,"Information Retrieval (IR) is a central component of many natural language applications. Traditionally, lexical methods (Robertson et al., 1994) have been used to search through text content. However, these methods suffer from the lexical gap (Berger et al., 2000) and are not able to recognize synonyms and distinguish between ambiguous words."
What are the factors that should be considered for memory footprint for indexing?,"Memory footprint for indexing should consider the number of documents, the size of the index, the amount of neural computations required, and the number of GPUs available","During indexing, we use another server with the same CPU and system memory specifications but which has four Titan V GPUs attached, each with 12 GiBs of memory. Across all experiments, only one GPU is dedicated per query for retrieval (i.e., for methods with neural computations) but we use up to all four GPUs during indexing.","To evaluate the latency of neural re-ranking models in §4.2, we use a single Tesla V100 GPU that has 32 GiBs of memory on a server with two Intel Xeon Gold 6132 CPUs, each with 14 physical cores (24 hyperthreads), and 469 GiBs of RAM.

"What are pros and cons of these models illustrated in Figure 2, and what are distinctions of the proposed model?  ","Pros of the interaction-based models (Figure 2(b) and (c)):

In particular, we find the maximum cosine similarity of each v\in E_{q} with vectors in E_{d}, and combine the outputs via summation.","Using E_{q} and E_{d}, ColBERT computes the relevance score between q and d via late interaction, which we define as a summation of maximum similarity (MaxSim) operators. In particular, we find the maximum cosine similarity of each v\in E_{q} with vectors in E_{d}, and combine the outputs via summation. Besides cosine, we also evaluate squared L2 distance as a measure of vector similarity. Intuitively, this interaction mechanism softly searches for each query term t_{q}—in a manner that reflects its context in the query—against the document’s embeddings, quantifying the strength of the “match” via the largest similarity score between t_{q} and a document term t_{d}. Given these term scores, it then estimates the document relevance by summing the matching evidence across all query terms. Given the representation of a query q and a document d, the relevance score of d to q, denoted as S_{q,d}, is estimated via late interaction between their bags of contextualized embeddings. As mentioned before, this is conducted as a sum of maximum similarity computations, namely cosine similarity (implemented as dot-products due to the embedding normalization) or squared L2 distance."
What are the metrics they used for measuring efficiency and effectiveness?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

MRR@10",They used (MRR@10) for measuring efficiency and effectiveness .,"Diving deeper into the quality–cost tradeoff between BERT and ColBERT, Figure 4 demonstrates the relationships between FLOPs and effectiveness (MRR@10) as a function of the re-ranking depth k when re-ranking the top-k results by BM25, comparing ColBERT and BERT{}_{\textnormal{base}} (our training). We conduct this experiment on MS MARCO (Dev). We note here that as the official top-1000 ranking does not provide the BM25 order (and also lacks documents beyond the top-1000 per query), the models in this experiment re-rank the Anserini (Yanget al., 2018) toolkit’s BM25 output. Consequently, both MRR@10 values at k=1000 are slightly higher from those reported in Table 1."
"What are the different aspects that MRR@10 and Recall@50/200/1000 capture, as evaluation metrics for end-to-end retrieval performance ?","MRR@10 and Recall@50/200/1000 capture different aspects of end-to-end retrieval performance, with MRR@10 focusing on precision at the top 10 retrieval positions, while Recall@50/200/1000 emphasizes the overall recall of relevant documents in the top N retrieval positions (where N = 50, 200, or 1000)","In fact, using ColBERT in the end-to-end setup is superior in terms of MRR@10 to re-ranking with the same model due to the improved recall. Moving beyond MRR@10, large gains in Recall@k for k equals to 50, 200, and 1000. For instance, its Recall@50 actually exceeds the official BM25’s Recall@1000 and even all but docTTTTTquery’s Recall@200, emphasizing the value of end-to-end retrieval (instead of just re-ranking) with ColBERT.","Shifting our attention to ColBERT’s end-to-end retrieval effectiveness, we see its major gains in MRR@10 over all of these end-to-end models. In fact, using ColBERT in the end-to-end setup is superior in terms of MRR@10 to re-ranking with the same model due to the improved recall. Moving beyond MRR@10, we also see large gains in Recall@k for k equals to 50, 200, and 1000. For instance, its Recall@50 actually exceeds the official BM25’s Recall@1000 and even all but docTTTTTquery’s Recall@200, emphasizing the value of end-to-end retrieval (instead of just re-ranking) with ColBERT."
"If both queries and documents are short, is still the fine-granular interaction required?",No,"During indexing, we use another server with the same CPU and system memory specifications but which has four Titan V GPUs attached, each with 12 GiBs of memory. Across all experiments, only one GPU is dedicated per query for retrieval (i.e., for methods with neural computations) but we use up to all four GPUs during indexing.","These increasingly expressive architectures are in tension. While interaction-based models (i.e., Figure 2 (b) and (c)) tend to be superior for IR tasks (Guo et al., 2019; Mitraet al., 2018), a representation-focused model—by isolating the computations among q and d—makes it possible to pre-compute document representations offline (Zamani et al., 2018), greatly reducing the computational load per query. In this work, we observe that the fine-grained matching of interaction-based models and the pre-computation of document representations of representation-based models can be combined by retaining yet judiciously delaying the query–document interaction. Figure 2 (d) illustrates an architecture that precisely does so. As illustrated, every query embedding interacts with all document embeddings via a MaxSim operator, which computes maximum similarity (e.g., cosine similarity), and the scalar outputs of these operators are summed across query terms. This paradigm allows ColBERT to exploit deep LM-based representations while shifting the cost of encoding documents offline and amortizing the cost of encoding the query once across all ranked documents. Additionally, it enables ColBERT to leverage vector-similarity search indexes (e.g., (Johnsonet al., 2017; Abuzaidet al., 2019)) to retrieve the top-k results directly from a large document collection, substantially improving recall over models that only re-rank the output of term-based retrieval."
"Targeting memory-efficient indexing, can we also prune out redundant tokens in documents while preserving a sufficient level of fine granularity?","Yes, we can prune out redundant tokens in documents while preserving a sufficient level of fine granularity","Targeting memory-efficient indexing, tokens are not appended in documents. We first segment a document d into its constituent tokens d_{1}d_{2}...d_{m}, to which we prepend BERT’s start token [CLS] followed by our special token [D] that indicates a document sequence. Unlike queries, we do not append [mask] tokens to documents. After passing this input sequence through BERT and the subsequent linear layer, the document encoder filters out the embeddings corresponding to punctuation symbols, determined via a pre-defined list. This filtering is meant to reduce the number of embeddings per document, as we hypothesize that (even contextualized) embeddings of punctuation are unnecessary for effectiveness.","Document Encoder.

"How much does the late interaction decrease computational costs, and how close is the performance of the late interaction model to the early interaction model?","The late interaction mechanism decreases computational costs by over 170 times in latency and 13,900 times in FLOPs compared to the early interaction model, while maintaining similar performance","In contrast with this trend, ColBERT (which employs late interaction over BERT performs no worse than the original adaptation of BERT for ranking and is only marginally less effective than BERT and our training of BERT. While highly competitive in effectiveness, ColBERT is orders of magnitude cheaper than BERT, in particular, by over 170\times in latency and 13,900\times in FLOPs.","In contrast with this trend, ColBERT (which employs late interaction over BERT{}_{\textnormal{base}}) performs no worse than the original adaptation of BERT{}_{\textnormal{base}} for ranking by Nogueira and Cho (Nogueira and Cho, 2019; Nogueiraet al., 2019b) and is only marginally less effective than BERT{}_{\textnormal{large}} and our training of BERT{}_{\textnormal{base}} (described above). While highly competitive in effectiveness, ColBERT is orders of magnitude cheaper than BERT{}_{\textnormal{base}}, in particular, by over 170\times in latency and 13,900\times in FLOPs. This highlights the expressiveness of our proposed late interaction mechanism, particularly when coupled with a powerful pre-trained LM like BERT. While ColBERT’s re-ranking latency is slightly higher than the non-BERT re-ranking models shown (i.e., by 10s of milliseconds), this difference is explained by the time it takes to gather, stack, and transfer the document embeddings to the GPU. In particular, the query encoding and interaction in ColBERT consume only 13 milliseconds of its total execution time. We note that ColBERT’s latency and FLOPs can be considerably reduced by padding queries to a shorter length, using smaller vector dimensions (the MRR@10 of which is tested in §4.5), employing quantization of the document vectors, and storing the embeddings on GPU if sufficient memory exists. We leave these directions for future work."
What kinds of distribution shifts are considered for evaluating retrievers on out-of-distribution datasets?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Out-of-distribution distribution shifts, including domain shifts and task-shifts","BioASQ, or task-shifts like in Touché-2020 distribution shifts are considered for evaluating retrievers on out-of-distribution datasets","3. Dense retrieval models with issues for out-of-distribution data. Dense retrieval models (esp. ANCE and TAS-B), that map queries and documents independently to vector spaces, perform strongly on certain datasets, while on many other datasets perform significantly worse than BM25.

DPR, the only non-MSMARCO trained dataset overall performs the worst in generalization on the benchmark."
Does a zero-shot scenario in this context refer to cases where relevance annotations are not available? Or are you referring to the case where the query set is also unavailable?,Zero-shot scenario in this context refers to cases where relevance annotations are not available,"creating a large training corpus is often time-consuming and expensive and hence many retrieval systems are applied in a zero-shot setup, with no available training data to train the system.

Even more important, it is unclear how well different approaches, like sparse embeddings vs. dense embeddings, generalize to out-of-distribution data."
"If dense/sparse retrievers are pre-trained on target corpus to enable the retrievers to be corpus-aware, can the fine-tuned retrievers outperform lexical models?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

NO.

According to the context, even when dense/sparse retrievers are pre-trained on the target corpus to enable corpus-awareness, they do not consistently outperform lexical models like BM25","If dense/sparse retrievers are pre-trained on target corpus to enable the retrievers to be corpus-aware, the fine-tuned retrievers underperform lexical models","We use beir to evaluate ten diverse retrieval methods from five broad architectures: lexical, sparse, dense, late interaction, and re-ranking. From our analysis, we find that no single approach consistently outperforms other approaches on all datasets. Further, we notice that the in-domain performance of a model does not correlate well with its generalization capabilities: models fine-tuned with identical training data might generalize differently. In terms of efficiency, we find a trade-off between the performances and the computational cost: computationally expensive models, like re-ranking models and late interaction model perform the best. More efficient approaches e.g. based on dense or sparse embeddings can substantially underperform traditional lexical models like BM25. Overall, BM25 remains a strong baseline for zero-shot text retrieval."

"What does ""speed"" mean in retrieval contexts? ",Time taken to retrieve results,Index are important as speed in retrieval system.,"Models need to potentially compare a single query against millions of documents at inference, hence, a high computational speed for retrieving results in real-time is desired. Besides speed, index sizes are vital and are often stored entirely in memory. We randomly sample 1 million documents from DBPedia Hasibi et al. (2017) and evaluate latency. For dense models, we use exact search, while for ColBERT we follow the original setup Khattab and Zaharia (2020) and use approximate nearest neighbor search. Performances on CPU were measured with an 8 core Intel Xeon Platinum 8168 CPU @ 2.70GHz and on GPU using a single Nvidia Tesla V100, CUDA 11.0."

Does the paper show that the learnt user intents by clustering are orthogonal to the sequence embeddings?,"Yes.

The paper shows that the learnt user intents by clustering are orthogonal to the sequence embeddings by ensuring that the intent factors are orthogonal to the sequence embeddings, which is necessary to avoid redundant information and improve the performance of the SR model","No, it does not.","Effectively modeling latent intentsfrom user behaviorsposes two challenges.First,it is extremely difficult to learn latent intents accuratelybecause we have no labelling data for intents.The only available supervision signals for intents are the user behavior data. Nevertheless, as aforementioned example indicates, distinct behaviors may reflect the same intent.Besides,effectively fusing intent informationinto a SR model is non-trivial.The target in SR is to predict next items in sequences, which is solved by encoding sequences.Leveraging latent intents of sequences into the model requires the intentfactors to be orthogonal to the sequence embeddings,which otherwise would induce redundant information. To discover the benefits oflatent intentsand address challenges,we propose theIntent Contrastive Learning (ICL),a general learning paradigm thatleverages the latent intentfactor into SR.It learns users’ intentdistributionsfrom all user behavior sequencesvia clustering.And it leveragesthe learnt intentsinto the SR modelvia a new contrastive SSL,whichmaximizes the agreementbetween a view of sequenceand its corresponding intent.The intent representation learning moduleand the contrastive SSL module are mutually reinforcedto train a more expressivesequence encoder.We tackle the challenge of intentmining problem byintroducing alatent variable to represent users’ intentsand learn them alternatelyalong with the SR model optimization throughan expectation-maximization (EM) frameworkto ensure convergence.We suggest fusing learnt intent informationinto SR via the proposed contrastive SSL,as it can improve model’s performance as wellas robustness.Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasetsfurther verify the effectiveness of the proposed learning paradigm,which improves performance and robustness,even when recommender systemsfaceheavy data sparsity issues."

Does the parallelization of transformer part of the proposed method reduce time complexity effectively?,Yes,"Logically, yes.

What was the value of maximum length T used for the experiment and how was the ratio of sequences that longer than length T?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Maximum length T used for the experiment was 10.

According to the context, the sequences were truncated to a maximum length of T=10, and if the sequence length was greater than T, the most recent T actions were considered. This means that for the experiment, the maximum length of the sequences was 10, and any sequences longer than 10 were truncated to 10.

As for the ratio of sequences that were longer than length T, the context does not provide direct information on this. However, based on the fact that the sequences were truncated to T=10, it can be inferred that some sequences were longer than 10, but the exact ratio of such sequences is not specified in the context","The value of T is not mentioned, and neither is the ratio of sequences that exceed T in length.","Assume that a recommender system has a set of usersand items denoted by \mathcal{U} and \mathcal{V} respectively.Each user u\in\mathcal{U} has a sequence of interacted itemssorted in chronological order S^{u}=[s^{u}_{1},\dots,s^{u}_{t},\dots,s^{u}_{|S^{u}|}]where |S^{u}| is the number of interacted itemsand s^{u}_{t} is the item u interacted atstep t. We denote \mathbf{S}^{u}as embedded representation of S^{u},where \mathbf{s}^{u}_{t} is the d-dimensional embedding of item s^{u}_{t}.In practice, sequences are truncated withmaximum length T.If the sequence length is greater than T, the mostrecent T actions are considered. If the sequence length is less than T, ‘padding’ items will beadded to the left until the length isT (Tang and Wang, 2018; Hidasi et al., 2015; Kang and McAuley, 2018).For each user u,the goal of next item prediction task is to predictthe next item that the user uis most likely to interact withat the |S_{u}|+1 step among the item set \mathcal{V},given sequence \mathbf{S}^{u}."
How does the paper show that the clustering result can be interpreted as users' intent?,"The paper shows that the clustering result can be interpreted as users' intent by demonstrating that the learned intent variables can capture users' distinct behaviors and preferences, and that the number of intent classes (K) affects the performance of the recommendation model. The paper also compares the learned intent variables with other methods of modeling users' intents, such as using side information (e.g., user action types) or incorporating intent into the recommendation model directly",It does not. K as a hyperparameter is only best believed as the number of user intents and does not necessarily equal the actual number of user intents.,"The main goal of next item prediction task is to optimizeEq. (1).Assume that there are also K different user intents (e.g., purchasing holiday gifts, preparing for fishing activity, etc.)in a recommender system that formsthe intent variable c=\left\{c_{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{K}, thenthe probability of a user interacting with a certainitem can be rewritten as follows:(7)\begin{split}P_{\theta}(s^{u})=\mathbb{E}_{(c)}\left[P_{\theta}(s^{u},c)\right].\end{split}However, users intents are latent by definition.Because of the missing observation of variable c,we are in a ‘chicken-and-eggs’ situation thatwithout c, we cannot estimate parameter \theta,and without \theta we cannot inferwhat the value of c might be. The larger of the intent class number K means users can havemore diverseintentions.The larger value of the strength of SeqCL objective \betameans the ICL task contributes more tothe final model.The results on Yelp is shown in Figure 5.We find that: (1)ICLRec reaches itsbest performance when increasing K to 512,and then it starts to deteriorateas K become larger.When K is very small,the number of users undereach intent prototype can potentially be large.As a result, false-positive samples(i.e., users that actually have different intentsare considered as having the same intent erroneously)are introduced to the contrastive SSL,thus affecting learning.On the other hand, when K is too large,the number of users undereach intent prototype is small,the introduced false-negative sampleswill also impair contrastive SSL.In Yelp, 512 user intents summarizeusers’ distinct behaviors best.(2) A ‘sweet-spot’ of \lambda=0.5 canalso be found.It indicatesthat the ICL task can benefitthe recommendation predictionas an auxiliary task.The impact of the batch size and \beta are provided in Appendix D. Recently, many approaches have been proposed to studyusers’ intents forimproving recommendations (Wanget al., 2019b; Cenet al., 2020; Li et al., 2019; Liet al., 2021b).MCPRN (Wanget al., 2019b)designs mixture-channel purposerouting networks to adaptivelylearnusers’ different purchase purposesof each itemunder different channels (sub-sequences) for session-based recommendation.MITGNN(Liuet al., 2020a)proposes amulti-intenttranslation graph neural networkto mine users’ multiple intentsby considering the correlations of the intents.ICM-SR (Panet al., 2020)designs anintent-guided neighbor detectorto retrieve correctneighbor sessionsfor neighbor representation.Different from session-based recommendation,another line of worksfocus on modeling the sequentialdynamics of users’ interaction behaviorsin a longer time span.DSSRec (Maet al., 2020)proposes a seq2seq trainingstrategy using multiple future interactions as supervision and introducing an intent variable from her historical and future behavior sequences.The intent variable is used to capture mutual information between an individual user’s historical and future behavior sequences.Two users of similar intentsmight be far away in representation space.Unlike this work, our intent variable is learned over all users’ sequences and is used to maximize mutual information across different users with similar learned intents.ASLI (Tanjim et al., 2020)captures intentvia a temporal convolutionalnetwork with side information (e.g., user action types such asclick, add-to-favorite, etc.),and then use the learnedintents toguide SR model to predictthe next item.Instead, our methodcan learn users’ intentsbased on user interactiondata only."
Why does the proposed method introduced EM framework to optimize the model (instead of directly optimizing the loss)?,To ensure convergence,EM guarantees convergence.,"Later, we will show that a generalized Expectation-Maximization frameworkprovides a direction to address above problemwith a convergence guarantee.The basic idea of optimizing Eq. (7) via EMis to start with an initial guessof the model parameter \thetaand estimate the expected valuesof the missing variable c, i.e., the E-step.And once we have the values of c,we can maximize the Eq. (7) w.r.t theparameter \theta, i.e., the M step.We can repeat this iterative process until the likelihood cannot increase anymore. To discover the benefits oflatent intentsand address challenges,we propose theIntent Contrastive Learning (ICL),a general learning paradigm thatleverages the latent intentfactor into SR.It learns users’ intentdistributionsfrom all user behavior sequencesvia clustering.And it leveragesthe learnt intentsinto the SR modelvia a new contrastive SSL,whichmaximizes the agreementbetween a view of sequenceand its corresponding intent.The intent representation learning moduleand the contrastive SSL module are mutually reinforcedto train a more expressivesequence encoder.We tackle the challenge of intentmining problem byintroducing alatent variable to represent users’ intentsand learn them alternatelyalong with the SR model optimization throughan expectation-maximization (EM) frameworkto ensure convergence.We suggest fusing learnt intent informationinto SR via the proposed contrastive SSL,as it can improve model’s performance as wellas robustness.Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasetsfurther verify the effectiveness of the proposed learning paradigm,which improves performance and robustness,even when recommender systemsfaceheavy data sparsity issues. In this work,we propose a new learning paradigm ICL that canmodel latent intent factorsfrom user interactionsand fuse them into a sequential recommendationmodel via a newcontrastive SSL objective.ICL is formulated withinan EM framework, which guaranteesconvergence. Detailed analyses showthe superiority of ICL andexperiments conducted onfour datasets further demonstratethe effectiveness of the proposed method."

What properties of costrastive self-supervised learning have attracted attention from researchers in the recommendation field?,"The properties of contrastive self-supervised learning that have attracted attention from researchers in the recommendation field include maximizing mutual information among positive transformations of the data itself, improving discrimination ability to negatives, and incorporating correlations among items, sub-sequences, and attributes of a given user behavior sequence",Sequences of user behavior can be maximally separated or brought together by means of contrastive SSL.,"Recent advances in contrastive SSLhave inspired therecommendation communityto leverage contrastive SSL tofuse correlations amongdifferent views of one sequence (Chenet al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020; Wuet al., 2021),following themutual information maximization (MIM) principle.Existing approaches in SRcan be seen asinstance discrimination tasksthat optimize a lower bound of MIM,such as InfoNCE (Oordet al., 2018; Heet al., 2020b; Chenet al., 2020; Liet al., 2020b).It aims to optimize theproportion of gap of positive pairs and negative pairs (Liu et al., 2021c).In such an instance discrimination task,sequence augmentations such as ‘mask’, ‘crop’, or ‘reorder’ are required tocreatedifferent views of the unlabeled data in SR (Sunet al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020; Xieet al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021).Formally, given a sequence S^{u},and a pre-defined data transformationfunction set \mathcal{G}, we can createtwo positive views of S^{u} as follows:(4)\tilde{S}^{u}_{1}=g_{1}^{u}(S^{u}),\tilde{S}^{u}_{2}=g_{2}^{u}(S^{u}),\text{ s.t. }g_{1}^{u},g_{2}^{u}\sim\mathcal{G},where g_{1}^{u} and g_{2}^{u} are transformation functions sampledfrom \mathcal{G} to createa different view of sequence s_{u}.Commonly, views created from the same sequenceare treated as positive pairs,and the views of any different sequencesare considered as negative pairs.The augmented views are first encoded with thesequence encoder f_{\theta}(\cdot) to\mathbf{\tilde{H}}^{u}_{1} and \mathbf{\tilde{H}}^{u}_{2},and then be fed into an ‘Aggregation’layer to get vector representationsof sequences, denoted as \mathbf{\tilde{h}}^{u}_{1} and \mathbf{\tilde{h}}^{u}_{2}. In this paper,we ‘concatenate’ users’ interest representations over time stepsfor simplicity. Note that sequences are prepossessed to have the same length (See Sec. 3.1), thustheir vector representations after concatenationhave the same length too.After that,we can optimize \theta via InfoNCE loss:(5)\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{SeqCL}}=\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{SeqCL}}(\mathbf{\tilde{h}}^{u}_{1},\mathbf{\tilde{h}}^{u}_{2})+\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{SeqCL}}(\mathbf{\tilde{h}}^{u}_{2},\mathbf{\tilde{h}}^{u}_{1}),and(6)\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{SeqCL}}(\mathbf{\tilde{h}}^{u}_{1},\mathbf{\tilde{h}}^{u}_{2})=-\log\frac{\exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{\tilde{h}}^{u}_{1},\mathbf{\tilde{h}}^{u}_{2}))}{\sum_{neg}\exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{\tilde{h}}^{u}_{1},\mathbf{\tilde{h}}_{neg}))},where sim(\cdot) is dot product and\mathbf{\tilde{h}}_{neg} are negativeviews’ representations of sequence S^{u}.Figure 2(a) illustrates how SeqCL works.

Can the proposed methodology utilize user intent information associated with user interaction data if available?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

YES.

The proposed methodology can utilize user intent information associated with user interaction data if available, as demonstrated by the improved performance of ICLRec compared to CL4SRec in the low interaction frequency group","Yes, it can.","Robustness w.r.t. user interaction frequency.Theuser ‘cold-start’ problem (Caiet al., 2021; Yinet al., 2020) is one of thetypical data-sparsity issues thatrecommender systems often face, i.e.,most users have limited historical behaviors.To check whether ICL improves the robustnessunder such a scenario,wesplit user behavior sequences into three groupsbased on their behavior sequences’ length, and keepthe total number of behavior sequencesthe same.Models are trained and evaluated on each group of usersindependently.

What does the proposed method BUIR require instead of negative sampling for training?,"BUIR requires only positive interactions for training, eliminating the need for negative sampling",BUIR requires positive user-item pairs instead of negative sampling for training.,"For all the datasets, BUIRid shows the substantially higher performance than the discriminative methods taking only user-id/item-id (i.e., BPR, NeuMF, CML, and SML).In particular, the sparser the training set becomes, the larger the performance improvement of BUIRid is achieved over the best baseline (denoted by Improvid).It is obvious that BUIRid is more robust to the extreme sparsity compared to the other baselines that are more likely to explicitly use “positive but unobserved” interactions as negative interactions when positive user-item interactions are more rarely observed.BUIRid is not affected by such inconsistent supervision from uncertain negative interactions because it directly optimizes the representations of users and items by using only positive interactions. As a solution to the aforementioned limitations, this paper proposes a novel OCCF framework, named as BUIR, which does not require the negative sampling at all for training the model.The main idea is, given a positive user-item interaction (u, v), to make representations for u and v similar to each other, in order to encode the preference information into the representations.However, a naive end-to-end learning framework that guides positive user-item pairs to be similar to each other without any negative supervision can easily converge to a collapsed solution – the encoder network outputs the same representations for all the users and items. First of all, the BPR framework that optimizes the cross-prediction score, q\left(f(u)\right)^{\top}f(v)+f(u)^{\top}q\left(f(v)\right), is not as effective as ours;it is even worse compared to the conventional BPR, which optimizes the inner-product score f(u)^{\top}f(v).This implies that the performance improvement of BUIR is mainly caused by our learning framework rather than its score modeling based on the predictor.In addition, even without the stochastic augmentation, the neighbor-based encoder (i.e., LGCN) based on the BUIR framework beats LGCN based on the BPR framework, which demonstrates that BUIR successfully addresses the issue of incorrect negative sampling.Lastly, our framework with the stochastic neighbor augmentation further improves the performance by taking benefits from various views of the positive user-item interactions for the optimization. This paper proposes a novel framework for learning the representations of users and items, termed as BUIR, to address the main challenges of the OCCF problem: the implicit assumption about negative interactions, and high sparsity of observed (positively-labeled) interactions.First, BUIR directly bootstraps the representations of users and items by minimizing their cross-prediction error.This makes BUIR use only partially-observed positive interactions for training the model, and accordingly, it can eliminate the need for negative sampling.In addition, BUIR is able to learn the augmented views of each positive interaction obtained from the neighborhood information, which further relieves the data sparsity issue of the OCCF problem.Through the extensive comparison with a wide range of OCCF methods, we demonstrate that BUIR consistently outperforms all the other baselines in terms of top-K recommendation.In particular, the effectiveness of BUIR becomes more significant for much sparse datasets in which the positively-labeled interactions are not enough to optimize the model as well as the assumption about negative interactions becomes less valid.Based on its great compatibility with existing user/item encoder networks, we expect that our BUIR framework can be a major solution for the OCCF problem, replacing the conventional BPR framework. Our extensive evaluation on real-world implicit feedback datasets shows that BUIR consistently performs the best for top-K recommendation among a wide range of OCCF methods.In particular, the performance improvement becomes more significant in sparser datasets, with the help of utilizing augmented views of positive interactions as well as eliminating the effect of uncertain negative interactions.In addition, comparison results on a downstream task, which classifies the items into their category, support that BUIR learns more effective representations than other OCCF baselines."
Is it true that approximating the online encoder slowly make the target encoder keep from converging to the collapsed solution?,Yes,Approximating the online encoder keep the target encoder from converging to the collapsed solution.,"Bypassing the collapsed solution.  It is obvious that the loss in Equation (3) admits the collapsed solution with respect to \theta and \xi, which means both the encoders generate the same representations for all users and items.For this reason, the conventional end-to-end learning strategy, which optimizes both f_{\theta} and f_{\xi} to minimize the loss (i.e., cross-prediction error), may easily lead to such collapsed solution.In contrast, our proposed framework updates each of the encoders in different ways.From Equation (4), the online encoder is optimized to minimize the loss, while the target encoder is updated to slowly approximate the online encoder.That is, the direction of updating the target encoder (\theta-\xi) totally differs from that of updating the online encoder (-\nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{L}_{\theta,\xi}),and this effectively keeps both the encoders from converging to the collapsed solution.Several recent work on bootstrapping-based representation learning (Grill et al., 2020; Chen and He, 2021) empirically demonstrated that this kind of dynamics (i.e., updating two networks differently) allows to avoid the collapsed solution without any explicit term to prevent it."
What component of the model eliminates the effect of uncertain negative interactions after the positive interaction augmentation?,The target encoder,Online encoders prevent models from collapsing into trivial solutions without explicitly using negative interactions for optimization.,"We argue that the above collapsed solution is incurred by the si\x02multaneous optimization of 𝑢 and 𝑣 within the end-to-end learning framework of a single encoder. Hence, we instead adopt the student\x02teacher-like network [6, 29] in which only the student’s output 𝑢 (and 𝑣) is optimized to predict the target 𝑣 (and 𝑢) presented by the teacher. Specifically, BUIR directly bootstraps1 the representations of users and items by employing two distinct encoder networks, referred to as online encoder and target encoder. The high-level idea is training only the online encoder for the prediction task between 𝑢 and 𝑣, where the target for its prediction is provided by the target encoder. That is, the online encoder is optimized so that its user (and item) vectors get closer to the item (and user) vectors com\x02puted by the target encoder. At the same time, the target encoder is updated based on momentum-based moving average [6, 8, 29] to slowly approximate the online encoder, which encourages to pro\x02vide enhanced representations as the target for the online encoder. By doing so, the online encoder can capture the positive relation\x02ship between 𝑢 and 𝑣 into the representations, while preventing the model from collapsing to the trivial solution without explicitly using any negative interactions for the optimization."
What are the benefits of using the predictor to calculate user-item interaction score instead of directly encoding into their inner product?,"Using the predictor to calculate user-item interaction scores instead of directly encoding them into their inner product allows for the capture of high-level relationships between users and items, resulting in more accurate representation and optimization of the latent space",Using predictor can optimize the representation without any negative sample.,"Existing discriminative OCCF methods (Rendle et al., 2009; Hsieh et al., 2017) have tried to optimize the latent space where the user-item interactions are directly encoded into their inner product (or Euclidean distance).On the contrary, BUIR additionally uses the predictor to model their interaction, which results in the capability of encoding the high-level relationship between users and items into the representations.In conclusion, with the help of the predictor, BUIR accurately computes the user-item interaction scores as well as optimizes the representation without explicitly using negative samples."
"What does ""stochastic"" mean in the stochastic data augmentation technique that the author introduced?","Random.

In the context of the stochastic data augmentation technique introduced by the author, ""stochastic"" refers to the fact that the augmentation is applied randomly to positive user-item pairs. Specifically, a random subset of a user's (and item's) neighbors is used as input features to the encoder, producing different views of the pairs. This randomness allows for the generation of various views of each positive user-item pair, effectively relieving the data sparsity issue in the OCCF problem",Stochastic means it use random neighborhood information of each user and item during data augmentation.,"In Figure 4, our stochastic data augmentation (i.e., P>0) brings a significant improvement compared to the case of using the fixed neighborhood information (i.e., P=0) as encoder inputs.This result shows that the augmented views of positive interactions encourage BUIR to effectively learn users’ preference on items even in much sparse dataset.Interestingly, in case of the Ciao dataset which is less sparse than CiteULike, the benefit of our augmentation linearly increases with the maximum drop probability.This is because there is room for producing more various views (i.e., larger perturbation) based on a relatively more number of neighbors, and it eventually helps to boost the recommendation performance.To sum up, our framework that adopts the neighbor augmentation function successfully relieves the data sparsity issue of the OCCF problem, by leveraging the augmented views of few positive interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a stochastic data augmentation technique to relieve the data sparsity problem in our framework.Motivated by the recent success of self-supervised learning in various domains (Chenet al., 2020; Devlinet al., 2019), we exploit augmented views of an input interaction, which are generated based on the neighborhood information of each user and item (i.e., the set of the items interacted with a user, and the users interacted with an item).The stochastic augmentation is applied to positive user-item pairs when they are passed to the encoder, so as to produce the different views of the pairs.To be precise, by making our encoder use a random subset of a user’s (and item’s) neighbors for the input features, it produces a similar effect to increasing the number of positive pairs from the data itself without any human intervention.In the end, BUIR is allowed to learn various views of each positive user-item pair."
What value of momentum coefficient (τ) makes the BULR model perform best?,τ=0.995,Model gets best performance when the value of parameter tau is larger or equal than 0.9 and smaller than 1.,"Implementation Details.  We implement the proposed framework and all the baselines by using PyTorch, and use the Adam optimizer to train them.For BUIR, we fix the momentum coefficient \tau to 0.995, and adopt a single linear layer for the predictor q_{\theta}.666We empirically found that these hyperparameters hardly affect the final performance of BUIR, and the sensitivity analysis on the parameters is provided in Section 4.6.The augmentation function \psi simply uses a uniform distribution for drawing a drop probability p\sim\mathcal{U}(0,1), where each user’s (item’s) neighbor is independently deleted with the probability p. Figure 6 clearly shows that the performance is hardly affected by \tau in the range of [0.9, 1.0).In other words, any values of \tau larger than 0.9 allow the target encoder to successfully provide the target representations to the online encoder, by slowly approximating the online encoder;on the contrary, BUIR cannot learn the effective representations at all in case that the target encoder is fixed (i.e., \tau=1).This observation is consistent with previous work on momentum-based moving average (Tarvainen andValpola, 2017; Heet al., 2020b; Grill et al., 2020) that showed all values of \tau between 0.9 and 0.999 can yield the best performance.Furthermore, BUIR performs the best with a single-layer predictor, because a multi-layer predictor makes it difficult to optimize the relationship between outputs of the two encoder networks.In conclusion, BUIR is more powerful even with fewer hyperparameters, compared to existing OCCF methods that include a variety of regularization terms or modeling components."
"In BUIR, how does the online encoder updated compared to the target encoder?","The online encoder is updated to minimize the loss, while the target encoder is updated slowly to approximate the online encoder","The online encoder is updated to minimize the error between the output and the target and updated by the gradients back-propagated from the loss, but target network is updated based on the momentum update and updated as the moving average of the online encoder .","BUIR makes use of two distinct encoder networks that have the same structure: online encoder f_{\theta} and target encoder f_{\xi}.They are parameterized by \theta and \xi, respectively.The key idea of BUIR is to train the online encoder by using outputs of the target encoder as its target, while gradually improving the target encoder as well.The main difference of BUIR from existing end-to-end learning frameworks is that f_{\theta} and f_{\xi} are updated in different ways.The online encoder is trained to minimize the error between its output and the target, whereas the target network is slowly updated based on the momentum update (Heet al., 2020b) so as to keep its output consistent. To sum up, the parameters of the online encoder and target encoder are optimized by(4)\begin{split}\theta&\leftarrow\theta-\eta\cdot\nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{L}_{\theta,\xi}\\\xi&\leftarrow\tau\cdot\xi+(1-\tau)\cdot\theta.\end{split}\eta is the learning rate for stochastic optimization, and \tau\in[0,1] is a momentum coefficient (also called as target decay) for momentum-based moving average.The online encoder f_{\theta} (and the predictor q_{\theta}) is effectively optimized by the gradients back-propagated from the loss (Equation (3)), while the target encoder f_{\xi} is updated as the moving average of the online encoder.By taking a large value of \tau, the target encoder slowly approximates the online encoder.This momentum-based update makes \xi evolve more slowly than \theta, which enables to bootstrap the representations by providing enhanced but consistent targets to the online encoders (Heet al., 2020b; Grill et al., 2020).Figure 1 illustrates the overall framework of BUIR with the simple one-hot encoders. Bypassing the collapsed solution.  It is obvious that the loss in Equation (3) admits the collapsed solution with respect to \theta and \xi, which means both the encoders generate the same representations for all users and items.For this reason, the conventional end-to-end learning strategy, which optimizes both f_{\theta} and f_{\xi} to minimize the loss (i.e., cross-prediction error), may easily lead to such collapsed solution.In contrast, our proposed framework updates each of the encoders in different ways.From Equation (4), the online encoder is optimized to minimize the loss, while the target encoder is updated to slowly approximate the online encoder.That is, the direction of updating the target encoder (\theta-\xi) totally differs from that of updating the online encoder (-\nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{L}_{\theta,\xi}),and this effectively keeps both the encoders from converging to the collapsed solution.Several recent work on bootstrapping-based representation learning (Grill et al., 2020; Chen and He, 2021) empirically demonstrated that this kind of dynamics (i.e., updating two networks differently) allows to avoid the collapsed solution without any explicit term to prevent it. Similarly to Section 3.2, the online encoder is trained by minimizing \mathcal{L}_{\theta,\xi}(\psi(u,\mathcal{V}_{u}),\psi(v,\mathcal{U}_{v})), and the target encoder is slowly updated by the momentum mechanism.After the optimization is finished, the interaction score is inferred by f_{\theta}(u,\mathcal{V}_{u}) and f_{\theta}(v,\mathcal{U}_{v}) (Equation (5)).Figure 2 shows an example of our data augmentation which injects a certain level of perturbations to the neighbors."
Why does assumning unobserved user-item pairs negative leads to limited performance for generative methods?,"Assuming unobserved user-item pairs negative leads to limited performance for generative methods because it becomes less valid as user-item interactions get sparser, and the uncertainty of supervision degrades the performance for top-K recommendation","Assuming unobserved user-item pairs negative leads to limited performance since there are some cases of positive but unobserved, and the number of this case is increased.","Nevertheless, the negative sampling approach has critical limitations in the following aspects.First, the underlying assumption about negative interactions becomes less valid as user-item interactions get sparser.This is because as fewer positive interactions are observed, the number of ”positive but unobserved” interactions increases, which consequently makes it even harder to sample correct negative ones.Such uncertainty of supervision eventually degrades the performance for top-K recommendation.Second, the convergence speed and the final performance depend on the specific choice of distributions for negative sampling.For example, sampling negative pairs from a non-uniform distribution (Rendle andFreudenthaler, 2014; Dinget al., 2019) (e.g., the multinomial distribution which models the probability of each interaction being actually negative) can improve the final performance, but inevitably incurs high computational costs, especially when a lot of users and items should be considered."
How did previous OCCF studies mitigated the problem of performance being largely depend on negative sampling distribution?,"By assuming all unobserved interactions are negative and using negative sampling strategies, such as random sampling or non-uniform distributions, to alleviate the computational burden and improve recommendation performance",Previous OCCF studies assume that all unobserved interactions are negative to mitigate the problem of performance being largely depend on negative sampling distribution,"However, since the negative interactions are not available in the OCCF problem, previous discriminative methods assume that all unobserved interactions are negative.In other words, for each user, the items that have not been interacted yet are regarded to be less preferred to positive items.In this sense, they either use all unobserved user-item interactions as negative or adopt a negative sampling, which randomly samples unobserved user-item interactions in a stochastic manner to alleviate the computational burden.For better recommendation performance and faster convergence, advanced negative sampling strategies (Rendle andFreudenthaler, 2014; Dinget al., 2019) are also proposed to sample from non-uniform distributions."
How does the negative pairs prevent the problem of collapsed solution during optimization in contrastive learning methods?,"The negative pairs do not prevent the problem of collapsed solution during optimization in contrastive learning methods. Instead, the bootstrapping-based self-supervised learning framework proposed in recent works (Grill et al., 2020; Chen and He, 2021) avoids the collapsed solution by directly bootstrapping the representation of images using two neural networks that iteratively learn from each other. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for various downstream tasks in computer vision and shows better robustness to the choice of data augmentations used for self-supervision","To prevent the problem of collapsed sollution, they update target encoder and online encoder differently.","Pointing out that the contrastive methods need to carefully treat the negative instances during the training for effectiveness and efficiency, the most recent work proposed a bootstrapping-based self-supervised learning framework (Grill et al., 2020; Chen and He, 2021), which is capable of avoiding the collapsed solution without the help of negative instances.Inspired by bootstrapping methods in deep reinforcement learning (Mnihet al., 2015; Mnih et al., 2016), it directly bootstraps the representation of images by using two neural networks that iteratively learn from each other.This approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance for various downstream tasks in computer vision, and also shows better robustness to the choice of data augmentations used for self-supervision. Bypassing the collapsed solution.  It is obvious that the loss in Equation (3) admits the collapsed solution with respect to \theta and \xi, which means both the encoders generate the same representations for all users and items.For this reason, the conventional end-to-end learning strategy, which optimizes both f_{\theta} and f_{\xi} to minimize the loss (i.e., cross-prediction error), may easily lead to such collapsed solution.In contrast, our proposed framework updates each of the encoders in different ways.From Equation (4), the online encoder is optimized to minimize the loss, while the target encoder is updated to slowly approximate the online encoder.That is, the direction of updating the target encoder (\theta-\xi) totally differs from that of updating the online encoder (-\nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{L}_{\theta,\xi}),and this effectively keeps both the encoders from converging to the collapsed solution.Several recent work on bootstrapping-based representation learning (Grill et al., 2020; Chen and He, 2021) empirically demonstrated that this kind of dynamics (i.e., updating two networks differently) allows to avoid the collapsed solution without any explicit term to prevent it."
"How does the authors show utilizing augmented views of positive interactions can lead the performance improvement, especially in sparser datasets?","By comparing the performance of BUIR with and without the neighbor augmentation function, the authors show that utilizing augmented views of positive interactions leads to performance improvement, especially in sparser datasets","They show augmented views of positive interactions can lead the performance improvement, especially in sparser datasets by showing the experimental result of stochastic data augmentation achieved a big improvement compared to the case of using the fixed neighborhood information as encoder inputs.","In Figure 4, our stochastic data augmentation (i.e., P>0) brings a significant improvement compared to the case of using the fixed neighborhood information (i.e., P=0) as encoder inputs.This result shows that the augmented views of positive interactions encourage BUIR to effectively learn users’ preference on items even in much sparse dataset.Interestingly, in case of the Ciao dataset which is less sparse than CiteULike, the benefit of our augmentation linearly increases with the maximum drop probability.This is because there is room for producing more various views (i.e., larger perturbation) based on a relatively more number of neighbors, and it eventually helps to boost the recommendation performance.To sum up, our framework that adopts the neighbor augmentation function successfully relieves the data sparsity issue of the OCCF problem, by leveraging the augmented views of few positive interactions. Our extensive evaluation on real-world implicit feedback datasets shows that BUIR consistently performs the best for top-K recommendation among a wide range of OCCF methods.In particular, the performance improvement becomes more significant in sparser datasets, with the help of utilizing augmented views of positive interactions as well as eliminating the effect of uncertain negative interactions.In addition, comparison results on a downstream task, which classifies the items into their category, support that BUIR learns more effective representations than other OCCF baselines."
Does utilizing the multi-hop neighbor information in meta-graph help improve the performance of the proposed model?,Yes,"Through experiments, the authors demonstrated that the performance of the model (i.e., MRR@10) decreased without knowledge propagation and that it was comparable to vanilla ERNIE, which demonstrated that multi-hop neighbors were essential for ranking performance. This result can be attributed to how using multi-hope neighbors allows for knowledge to propagate between query and passage.","Knowledge propagation via meta-graph.It is worth noting that, the above-defined knowledge injection process only leverages knowledge embeddings learned by TransE on the global graph \overline{\mathcal{G}}. Particularly, it lacks considering the knowledge that bridges the semantics between query and passage. To this end, we introduce a Graph Meta Network (GMN) module that refines knowledge with the constructed meta-graph \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}}, The multi-hop paths of \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}} allow the knowledge to be propagated between query and passage, which can enhance the relevance signal to be captured by the model, and thus alleviate the semantic gap. By applying a K-layer GMN in each layer of the knowledge injector, the output entity representation \hat{\mathbf{E}}_{e_{h}}^{(K)} can ensemble knowledge from all the K-hop neighbors. As described in Section 4.1.2 that all the paths of \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}} between \mathbf{q} and \mathbf{p} is within K hops, the GMN module can attentively propagate knowledge along the paths from entities in \mathbf{p} to those in \mathbf{q}, and vice versa, which can enrich the semantics of the entities that benefit the relevance modeling. Table 3 shows the performance comparisons between different settings of knowledge injector, which is statistically significant. From this table, we can observe the following phenomena. (1) MRR@10 of KERM without interaction and propagation process decreases at least 1\% respectively. This indicates both knowledge interaction and propagation processes play an indispensable role in ranking performance. (2) The performance of KERM without propagation is comparable to vanilla ERNIE. Not only query and passage entities, but also their multi-hop neighbors are essential for the ranking performance. (3) MRR@10 of KERM without knowledge interaction drops the most. It suggests the simple and straightforward way to aggregate knowledge graph with text does not work in the passage re-ranking scenario. The text and knowledge graph need to be refined with each other mutually in the interaction, which will be further analyzed in detail as follows."
What components of the proposed method aggregate explicit knowledge into implicit knowledge for query and passage embedding?,"The proposed method aggregates explicit knowledge into implicit knowledge for query and passage embedding through the following components:

1. Graph Meta Network (GMN) module, which refines knowledge with the constructed meta-graph \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}} and propagates knowledge between query and passage.
2. Novel interaction module between text and knowledge graph, which combines implicit and explicit knowledge.
3. Knowledge injector module, which aggregates word and entity representations from PLM and GMN, respectively, to inject implicit knowledge from text corpus into the passage embedding","This work proposes an aggregation module that employs a PLM and a Graph Neural Network (GMN) to model the interaction between explicit and implicit knowledge. The PLM encodes text to obtain word representations (i.e., implicit knowledge), and the Graph Neural Network (GMN) encodes knowledge meta-graphs to obtain entity representations (i.e., explicit knowledge). This module aggregates the word and entity representations to aggregate the implicit and explicit knowledge.","Knowledge propagation via meta-graph.It is worth noting that, the above-defined knowledge injection process only leverages knowledge embeddings learned by TransE on the global graph \overline{\mathcal{G}}. Particularly, it lacks considering the knowledge that bridges the semantics between query and passage.

For knowledge aggregation, we design a novel interaction module between text and knowledge graph to combine the implicit and explicit knowledge. To derive implicit knowledge from text, we employ PLM as text encoder. To be aligned with implicit knowledge, knowledge meta graph is encoded with a multi-layer graph neural network (i.e. k-hop), namely Graph Meta Network (GMN). Each transformer layer outputs word representations. Each graph meta network layer outputs entity representations. Both word and entity representations are aggregated as the input of the following transformer and GMN layer, respectively in a novelly designed module, namely knowledge injector. Therefore through knowledge aggregation, implicit knowledge from text corpus and explicit knowledge from existing knowledge graph can mutually boost each other to achieve a better re-ranking performance, in which the issues in Challenge 2. could be mitigated. Overall, our contributions can be summarized as follows:•It is the first attempt to solve the knowledge enhanced PLMs problem for passage re-ranking. The key motivation lies in that bridging the semantic gap between the query and passage with the help of both kinds of knowledge.•We design a novel knowledge graph distillation method. It refines a reliable knowledge graph from the existing one globally and constructs a knowledge meta graph based on the refined graph locally.•We propose a novel aggregation of PLM and graph neural network framework to model the interaction between explicit knowledge and implicit knowledge.•Experimental results show the effectiveness of KERM on both general and domain specific data, achieving state-of-the-art performance for passage re-ranking. We also conduct a comprehensive study for the effects of each module in our method. The code is available at https://github.com/DQ0408 /KERM."
Does the paper show how each component of KERM can contribute to passage re-ranking performance quantitatively and qualitatively?,"Yes. The paper shows how each component of KERM contributes to passage re-ranking performance through ablation studies, which demonstrate the importance of both knowledge interaction and propagation processes, as well as the effectiveness of knowledge graph distillation in improving performance","This work conducted ablation studies to investigate the contribution of each component in the performance of KERM. By testing different settings for the knowledge injector, this work found that performance decreases without knowledge interaction and also without knowledge propagation. By testing the model without global or local distillation, they also demonstrated that performance decreases without global distillation and efficiency decreases without either global or local distillation. These experiments demonstrate that each component of KERM contributes to passage re-ranking performance quantitatively.","Here we compare ranking performances of KERM and other PLMs based re-rankers on the first two widely used query sets. Moreover, ablation studies for each component of KERM are also explored. All experimental results were reported under the same BM25 setting. Table 3 shows the performance comparisons between different settings of knowledge injector, which is statistically significant. From this table, we can observe the following phenomena. (1) MRR@10 of KERM without interaction and propagation process decreases at least 1\% respectively. This indicates both knowledge interaction and propagation processes play an indispensable role in ranking performance. (2) The performance of KERM without propagation is comparable to vanilla ERNIE.

Knowledge graph distillation is performed in both global and local perspectives. To explore their roles in the ranking performance, we remove the graph pruning globally and sentence selection locally respectively, keep other settings unchanged, and derive KERM without graph pruning and sentence selection respectively. From results on TREC 2019 DL in Table 5, observations are listed as below. (1) Without global graph pruning, MRR@10 and the average edge score, calculated through Eq.(3), decrease the most, and the time efficiency drops slightly. This indicates the original knowledge graph exists noise data that affect performance. (2) Without sentence selection, the time efficiency drops the most and the average edge score decreases slightly, which proves that not every sentence in a passage has a positive effect on semantic matching. Overall, knowledge graph distillation is significant to KERM."
Does the author showed that the distillation on the knowledge graph can be useful for re-ranking task?,"Yes. The author showed that knowledge graph distillation can be useful for the re-ranking task by experimenting with and without global graph pruning and sentence selection, and observing the results on TREC 2019 DL. The results indicate that knowledge graph distillation is significant to KERM and can improve the ranking performance","This work proposes using knowledge graph distillation as it can help retain only informative knowledge needed for passage re-ranking. By investigating the effect of global and local distillation separately, this work found that the MRR@10 score and efficiency decreased slightly without global distillation, and that time efficiency decreased the most without local distillation. Therefore, this work demonstrates that both global and local distillation of knowledge graphs is useful for re-ranking tasks in terms of performance and efficiency.","Existing knowledge graphs are usually incomplete and noisy. It is unsuitable for direct introduction of them to the current model. Specially, there is no knowledge base particularly for passage re-ranking task. For example, ConceptNet (Speeret al., 2017) is a general knowledge graph that contains common sense knowledge, where the information might not be useful for our passage re-ranking task. Therefore, it is critical for us to propose a knowledge graph distillation process from both global and local perspectives. Knowledge graph distillation is performed in both global and local perspectives. To explore their roles in the ranking performance, we remove the graph pruning globally and sentence selection locally respectively, keep other settings unchanged, and derive KERM without graph pruning and sentence selection respectively. From results on TREC 2019 DL in Table 5, observations are listed as below. (1) Without global graph pruning, MRR@10 and the average edge score, calculated through Eq.(3), decrease the most, and the time efficiency drops slightly. This indicates the original knowledge graph exists noise data that affect performance. (2) Without sentence selection, the time efficiency drops the most and the average edge score decreases slightly, which proves that not every sentence in a passage has a positive effect on semantic matching. Overall, knowledge graph distillation is significant to KERM. The main goal of this paper is to reasonably introduce external knowledge graph to PLMs for passage re-ranking. We first design a novel knowledge meta graph construction method to distill reliable and query related knowledge from a general and noisy knowledge graph. The knowledge meta graph bridges the semantic gap between each query and passage. Then we propose a knowledge injector layer for mutually updating text and knowledge representations, which transformers word to entity representations for graph meta network, vice versa. Knowledge Enhanced Ranking Model is pretrained with Masked Language Model (MLM) Sentence Relation Prediction (SRP) [38] tasks, and fine-tuned with cross entropy loss function for passage re-ranking task. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art baselines without external knowledge due to its first attempt. The role of each module in KERM is also comprehensively analyzed. Since this work was limited to the one-to-one meta-graph of a query-passage pair built online, continued efforts are needed to make knowledge enhancement more efficient for both retrieval and re-ranking stage. Despite that the knowledge graph distillation in our method is empirically shown to be effective for the final performance, the implementation of graph pruning and meta-graph construction is still based on simple heuristics. A more promising way of formulating a useful meta-graph is to jointly learn a graph generator with the reranker in an end-to-end fashion, which enables more flexibility.Besides, it is currently infeasible to exploit the external knowledge in the retrieval stage, which needs to exhaustively build massive meta-graphs for a large scale of candidates. A further study could focus on how to use external knowledge in PLM based retriever. For knowledge graph distillation, we propose a novel pipeline to establish knowledge meta graphs, which only retain informative knowledge for passage re-ranking. Specifically, we first distill a graph globally for passage re-ranking scenario from an existing knowledge graph by pruning some unreliable or noisy relations based on TransE embedding. Then for a specific query-passage pair, we extract entities from both the query and passage, and construct a query-document bipartite entity graph based on query and passage entities and their k-hop neighbors, namely knowledge meta graph. Challenge 1. could be addressed in this distillation process."
Who collected the queries from MSMARCO-Passage dataset to make MSMARCO-TRAIN query set?,Nguyen et al. (2016) collected the queries from MSMARCO-Passage dataset to make MSMARCO-TRAIN query set,MARCO-Passage collection is a large-scale publicly available corpus and two query sets derived from this corpus are used in the paper: MSMARCO-TRAIN and MSMARCO-DEV. How and who collected the queries from MARCO-Passage to construct MSMARCO-TRAIN cannot be answered from this paper.,"We use a large-scale public available corpus, i.e., MSMARCO-Passage collection (Nguyen et al., 2016), as our passage collection. This collection contains approximately 8.8 million passages extracted from 3.2 million web documents covering multiple fields. We train our model on the MSMARCO-TRAIN query set of 502,939 queries and evaluate KERM on three query sets. Table 1 provides the detailed information of these query sets.The first test set is MSMARCO-DEV, which includes 6,980 sparsely-judged queries mixed with multiple domains. Each query has an average of 1.1 relevant passages with binary relevance label.The second test set is TREC 2019 DL (Craswell et al., 2020), which contains 43 densely-judged queries with fine-grained relevance labels, i.e., irrelevant, relevant, highly relevant and perfectly relevant. On average, a query has 95.4 relevant passages, and most queries have more than 10 relevant passages. With fine-grained labels and multiple relevant passages per query, TREC 2019 DL can be used to reflect the fine-grained ranking performance between relevant passages.To evaluate KERM on specific domains, we further introduce Ohsumed 111http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/corpora.htm query set, which contains 63 queries on bio-medical domain.The collection of Ohsumed is constructed from the first 20,000 passages in Mesh categories of the year 1991.Following the previous work (Joachims, 1998), the test collection including 10,000 passages are utilized for performance comparison on Ohsumed query set.Each query has an average of 50.9 relevant passages with three graded relevance labels. In section 6.4, we demonstrate that the quality of external knowledge constructed by KERM in such domain could be more useful."
What methods refine the graph containing external knowledge in 1) global and 2) local way?,"1. Global refinement: TransE embedding pruning.
2. Local refinement: Query-document bipartite entity graph construction","The knowledge graph is distilled globally by taking an existing knowledge graph and pruning unreliable or noise relations based on TransE embeddings. The graph is then distilled locally by extracting entities from both the given query and passage, and constructing a query-document bipartite entity graph based on the extracted entities and their k-hop neighbors.","For knowledge graph distillation, we propose a novel pipeline to establish knowledge meta graphs, which only retain informative knowledge for passage re-ranking.

What is the example of unreliable relations in knowledge graph for passage re-ranking scenario?,"Unreliable relations in knowledge graphs for passage re-ranking scenarios can be seen in the form of trivial factual triples, such as the relation between hepatitis and adult, which is more general than infectious disease","Unreliable relations in a knowledge graph involve trivial factual triplets that do not bring substantial information gain. For example, in ConceptNet, the entity “hepatitis” has relations with both “infectious disease” and “adult”. To the concept “hepatitis”,  the concept “adults” is more general than “infectious disease” and thus the relationship between “hepatitis” and “infectious disease” is more reliable and informative.","•Challenge 1. Existing knowledge graph are not constructed for re-ranking task. They usually contain trivial factual triples, which can hardly bring information gain. The inappropriate selection of external knowledge could even jeopardize the re-ranker performance. How to utilize existing knowledge graph to re-ranking task is remain a challenge.•Challenge 2.The explicit knowledge and implicit knowledge are highly heterogeneous due to the different sources, which makes the aggregation of the two difficult.How to mutually refine each other and effectively aggregate explicit knowledge into implicit knowledge to alleviate the semantic gap between query and passage is still a challenge. Fig. 2 shows a real case of our global graph pruning method on ConceptNet, i.e., a general knowledge graph. In this case, the entity hepatitis has various relations to disease, infectious disease, adult, etc. From the distance of nodes in Fig. 2, we can clearly observe that the knowledge hepatitis is an infectious disease is more reliable and informative than hepatitis is located at adult. To hepatitis, the concept adult is more general than infectious disease. This indicates that our pruning method can effectively eliminate less informative knowledge."
"What does ""meta"" means in the term graph meta network (GMN)?","""meta"" in graph meta network (GMN) refers to the fact that the network operates on a higher level of abstraction, leveraging knowledge from the global graph to refine the knowledge embeddings and alleviate the semantic gap between query and passage",The Graph Meta Network (GMN) refines knowledge in a meta-graph. A meta-graph is a graph that is constructed by constructing multi-hop paths between the entities in a query and a passage using the knowledge from a global graph. The meaning for “meta” in both graph meta network (GMN) and meta-graph is not explicitly defined in this paper.,"Knowledge propagation via meta-graph.It is worth noting that, the above-defined knowledge injection process only leverages knowledge embeddings learned by TransE on the global graph \overline{\mathcal{G}}. Particularly, it lacks considering the knowledge that bridges the semantics between query and passage. To this end, we introduce a Graph Meta Network (GMN) module that refines knowledge with the constructed meta-graph \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}}, The multi-hop paths of \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}} allow the knowledge to be propagated between query and passage, which can enhance the relevance signal to be captured by the model, and thus alleviate the semantic gap. For knowledge aggregation, we design a novel interaction module between text and knowledge graph to combine the implicit and explicit knowledge. To derive implicit knowledge from text, we employ PLM as text encoder. To be aligned with implicit knowledge, knowledge meta graph is encoded with a multi-layer graph neural network (i.e. k-hop), namely Graph Meta Network (GMN). Each transformer layer outputs word representations. Each graph meta network layer outputs entity representations. Both word and entity representations are aggregated as the input of the following transformer and GMN layer, respectively in a novelly designed module, namely knowledge injector. Therefore through knowledge aggregation, implicit knowledge from text corpus and explicit knowledge from existing knowledge graph can mutually boost each other to achieve a better re-ranking performance, in which the issues in Challenge 2. could be mitigated. Different from existing knowledge-enhanced PLMs for other NLP tasks, our aim for the re-ranking task is particularly on the relevance modeling between query and passage. Thus, we further leverage the knowledge in the global graph G to construct “bridges” between query and passage, which alleviates the semantic gap and improves semantic modeling. More specifically, for a given query-passage pair (i.e., (q, p)), we propose to construct a bipartite meta-graph that connects those entities in the q and those in p."

Other researches, such asRepBERT (Zhanet al., 2020), ColBERT (Khattab andZaharia, 2020), COIL (Gaoet al., 2021) and Interactor (Yeet al., 2022), obtain multiple vectors for query and passage for matching.(2) By optimizing the representation learning module: RocketQAv1 (Qu et al., 2021) and RocketQAv2 (Ren et al., 2021) boost the representation learning of retriever by leveraging the power of cross-encoder in a cascade or joint manner. Other studies boost the representation learning by designed IR-oriented pre-training tasks.ICT (Leeet al., 2019) treats sentences as pseudo-queries and matched them to the passage they originate from.

Given a query q, passage re-ranking aims at ordering a set of 𝜘 passages, i.e., P =  p𝜅 	𝜘 𝜅=1 , which is usually retrieved from a large-scale passage collection by a retriever, e.g. BM25 [48], DPR [16] etc. In particular, a passage is a sequence of words p = {𝑤𝑝 } |p| 𝑝=1 , where |p| is the length of passage p. Similarly, a query is a sequence of words q = {𝑤𝑞 } |q| 𝑞=1 . Note that a passage p consists of 𝑇 sentences p = {s𝜏 } 𝑇 𝜏=1."
What is the difference of RocketQAv1 and RocketQAv2 model?,"RocketQAv2 is an improved version of RocketQAv1.

RocketQAv1 trains dual-encoder and cross-encoder in a cascade manner, while RocketQAv2 jointly trains the dense passage retriever and passage re-ranker. Additionally, RocketQAv2 utilizes a large PLM for data augmentation and denoising, which can be regarded as a distillation procedure. This allows RocketQAv2 to improve the effectiveness of the model by leveraging explicit external knowledge","RocketQAv1 trains dual-encoder and cross-encoder in a cascade manner, which leverages the powerful cross-encoder to empower the dual-encoder. While it inherits the parameters from RocketQAv1, RocketQAv2 extends the first version through a novel approach that jointly trains the dense passage retriever and passage re-ranker, and by using a large PLM for data augmentation and denoising (i.e.,  a distillation procedure).","Existing PLMs based re-rankers typically improve ranking performance from two aspects: (1) By optimizing the ranking procedure: monoBERT (Nogueira and Cho, 2019) is the first work that re-purposed BERT as a passage re-ranker and achieves state-of-the-art results. duoBERT (Nogueiraet al., 2019a) integrates monoBERT in a multistage ranking architecture and adopts a pairwise classification approach to passage relevance computation. UED (Yanet al., 2021) proposes a cascade pre-training manner that can jointly enhance the retrieval stage through passage expansion with a pre-trained query generator and thus elevate the re-ranking stage with a pre-trained transformer encoder. The two stages can facilitate each other in a unified pre-training framework. H-ERNIE (Chuet al., 2022) proposes a multi-granularity PLM for web search.(2) By designing rational distillation procedure: LM Distill + Fine-Tuning (Gaoet al., 2020) explores a variety of distillation methods to equip a smaller re-ranker with both general-purpose language modeling knowledge learned in pre-training and search- specific relevance modeling knowledge learned in fine-tuning, and produces a faster re-ranker with better ranking performance. CAKD (Hofstätter et al., 2020) proposes a cross-architecture knowledge distillation procedure with a Margin-MSE loss, which can distill knowledge from multiple teachers at the same time. RocketQAv1 (Qu et al., 2021) trains dual-encoder and cross-encoder in a cascade manner, which leverages the powerful cross-encoder to empower the dual-encoder. RocketQAv2 (Ren et al., 2021) proposes a novel approach that jointly trains the dense passage retriever and passage re-ranker. The parameters of RocketQAv2 are inherited from RocketQAv1. Besides, RocketQAv2 utilizes a large PLM for data augmentation and denoising, which can also be regarded as a distillation procedure. Notably, these two types of studies anticipate more insightful information to be captured by the advanced ranking and training procedures, while neglecting the limitations of implicit knowledge extracted from noisy and heterogeneous data. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed the first knowledge-enhanced PLM based re-ranker, which thoughtfully leverages explicit external knowledge that improve the effectiveness of the model. We include several PLMs based re-rankers in our evaluation, including the state-of-the-art:•monoBERT (Nogueira and Cho, 2019): The first study that re-purposes BERT as a re-ranker and achieves state-of-the-art results.•duoBERT (Nogueiraet al., 2019a):This work proposes a pairwise classification approach using BERT, which obtains the ability to be more sensitive to semantics through greater computation.•UED (Yanet al., 2021): A unified pre-training framework that jointly refines re-ranker and query generator. For a fair comparison, we only use the re-ranker in UED without passage expansion.•LM Distill+Fine-Tuning (LDFT) (Gaoet al., 2020):A variety of distillation methods are compared in this paper. The experimental results indicate that a proper distillation procedure (i.e. first distill the language model, and then fine-tune on the ranking task) could produce a faster re-ranker with better ranking performance.•CAKD (Hofstätter et al., 2020): This work proposes a cross-architecture knowledge distillation procedure with Margin-MSE loss, which can distill knowledge from multiple teachers.•RocketQAv1 (Qu et al., 2021): This work mainly focuses on the training of PLM based retriever, where the re-ranker is an intermediate product of its training process.•RocketQAv2 (Ren et al., 2021): Based on RocketQAv1, this work proposes a novel approach that jointly trains the PLM based retriever and re-ranker.To compare the performance of different methods, we resort to two ranking metrics.For MSMARCO-DEV, We adopt Mean Reciprocal Rank (i.e., MRR@10).For TREC 2019 DL, we use Mean Average Precision, i.e., MAP@10 and MAP@30.For Ohsumed, both Mean Reciprocal Rank and Mean Average Precision (i.e., MRR@10 and MAP@10) are employed for comprehensive performance analysis in queries requiring in-depth domain knowledge."
Would the performance be improved if the PLM model is pre-trained or fine-tuned on bio-medical domain datasets?,Yes,"In their experiments, the authors showed that all of the models performed poorly on the bio-medical domain due to the textual data of the domain not being covered widely in the PLMs’ pretraining dataset. This lack of data can cause the PLM to struggle to reveal and capture knowledge specific to that domain. These results suggest that further training on bio-medical data could increase performance.","However, implicit knowledge still has some inherent weaknesses, which limits the applicability of PLMs based re-rankers. First,queries and passages are usually created by different persons and have different expression ways (Nogueiraet al., 2019b), such as word usage and language style.Worse still, the data distributions of search queries and web contents are highly heterogeneous (Liuet al., 2021), where various specialized domains (e.g., bio-medical) may only have few training examples in a general corpus. Domain-specific knowledge can hardly be revealed and captured by the model, and thus the processing of domain-specific queries is often inaccurate. Results are obtained from Table 6. (1) Poor ranking performances of all models on bio-medical domain indicates that it is more challenging in the data scarcity scenario, where textual data is not covered widely in the PLMs’ pretraining datasets. (2) Compared with ERNIE, KERM has a higher relative improvement in bio-medical domain than general domain. This demonstrates that the incorporation of knowledge graph is more useful for a data scarcity domain. To verify this idea, we compare the size of knowledge meta graph used for different domains as follows."
What characteristics of large-scale pre-trained language models made it remarkable successful for passage re-ranking task?,The expressive transformer structure and the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm of large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) have contributed to their remarkable success on the passage re-ranking task,Large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been found to be successful for passage re-ranking due to their ability to learn semantic relevance in the latent space from massive textual corpus. PLMs obtain this ability from their expressive transformer architecture and the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm.,"Passage Re-ranking is a crucial stage in modern information retrieval systems, which aims to reorder a small set of candidate passages to be presented to users. To put the most relevant passages on top of a ranking list, a re-ranker is usually designed with powerful capacity in modeling semantic relevance, which attracted a wealth of research studies in the past decade (Guo et al., 2020). Recently,large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), e.g. BERT (Devlinet al., 2018), ERNIE (Sun et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), have dominated many natural language processing tasks, and have also achieved remarkable success on passage re-ranking.For example, PLM based re-rankers (MacAvaney et al., 2019; Liet al., 2020; Dong and Niu, 2021; Donget al., 2022) have achieved state-of-the-art performance, which takes the concatenation of query-passage pair as input, and applies multi-layer full-attention to model their semantic relevance. Their superiority can be attributed to the expressive transformer structure and the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm, which allow the model to learn useful implicit knowledge (i.e., semantic relevance in the latent space) from massive textual corpus (Fan et al., 2021)."
How does the knowledge distilation works if meta-graph can't be constructed (i.e. there is no corresponding entities in knowledge graph for query/passage)?,"The knowledge distillation process does not rely on the construction of the meta-graph. Instead, it uses the pre-trained word embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between the query, passage, and target entities. Even if there are no corresponding entities in the knowledge graph, the distillation process can still leverage the word embeddings to learn the relevant information from the passage","Entities that exactly match entities in E are selected from q and s* to construct the meta-graph. Also, entities that are sub-sequences of other recognized entities are omitted. This process assumes that entities are identified in the query and passage. The process for handling cases where no entities are identified cannot be answered in this paper.","(1)Key sentence selection. The actual information need of a user usually concentrates on a small part of a relevant passage (Guo et al., 2020). To this end, we mimic human judgment and only focus on the sentence of each passage that is the most related to a query (Zou et al., 2021).In particular, we define the relevance score between a query q and a sentence \textbf{s}_{i} as(7)Rel_{qs}(\textbf{q},\textbf{s}_{i})=\frac{\sum_{q=1}^{|\textbf{q}|}\textbf{E}(w_{q})}{|\textbf{q}|}\cdot\frac{\sum_{s=1}^{|\textbf{s}_{i}|}\textbf{E}(w_{s})}{|\textbf{s}_{i}|}.For the sake of efficiency, we initialize \textbf{E}(w) from Word2Vec (Mikolovet al., 2013) embedding.Based on Eq.(7), we select the most relevant sentence \textbf{s}^{*} in p to build the meta-graph for \mathbf{q} and \mathbf{p}.(2)Target entity recognition.Next, we select the entities in q and \textbf{s}^{*} to construct the meta-graph. Specifically, we only consider the entities that exactly match in \mathcal{E}. Meanwhile, we omit those entity phrases that are sub-sequences of other recognized entities.For example, in the query ""what causes low liver enzymes"", both ""liver"" and ""liver enzyme"" are entities, but the entity ""liver enzyme"" is more informative to be recognized as the target entity, and ""liver"" should be omitted.(3)Path discovery. Finally, given the target entities of q and \textbf{s}^{*} (denoted as \phi_{\mathbf{q}} and \phi_{\mathbf{s}^{*}}, respectively), we perform Breadth First Search (BFS) on \overline{\mathcal{G}} to discover the paths within K-hop between \phi_{\mathbf{q}} and \phi_{\mathbf{s}^{*}}. Note that we only keep the within-K-hop paths that might be the most useful for the downstream re-ranking task. Meanwhile, the knowledge could be complemented from the K-hop paths."
Does this method likely to show similar tendency of performance improvement when other backbone model (like BERT_large) is used?,"Yes.

The use of a different backbone model, such as BERT_large, is likely to result in similar performance improvements as the KERM model, due to the explicit introduction of external knowledge alleviating the semantic gap and heterogeneity between query and passage","Through the experiments, this work demonstrated that the KERM model was able to significantly improve on the performance of its backbone model, ERNIE. The authors posit that this is due to how KERM explicitly introduces external knowledge which can improve semantic matching performance. This suggests that KERM models with other backbone models will be able to improve on the performance of their backbone models. However, the likelihood of performance improvements with other backbone models cannot be answered from this paper.","We use the traditional sparse retriever BM25 (Yanget al., 2017) as our first stage method. All experiments are conducted under the same BM25 setting with 1000 retrieved candidates. We conduct experiments with the deep learning framework PaddlePaddle (Maet al., 2019) on up to 4 NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPUs (with 40G RAM). For the GMN module, we use Paddle Graph Learning (PGL) 222https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PGL, an efficient and flexible graph learning framework based on PaddlePaddle. For training, we used the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 1e-5 for text encoder and 1e-4 for knowledge injector. The model is trained up to 5 epochs with a batch size of 640 and 240 for base and large models respectively.In our experiments, the PLM small, base and large models have 6, 12 and 24 Transformer layers respectively.The text encoder has 9 layers and 21 layers for base and large model respectively, and the knowledge injector both has 3 layers in our experiment. The dropout rates are set to 0.1. The ratio of the positive to the hard negative is set to 1:19.All transformer layers in KERM’s backbone are initialized from ERNIE-2.0 base (Sunet al., 2020b), which is a BERT-like model pre-trained with a continual pre-training framework on multiple tasks. We perform Knowledge-enhanced pre-training on MARCO passage collection to warm up the parameters in knowledge injector, which has 60,000 iterations under the batch size of 256.For a fair comparison, the same pre-training without knowledge enhancement is also conducted on \textrm{ERNIE}_{\textrm{base}} re-ranker and all models in ablation studies. (4) Compared with \textrm{ERNIE}_{\textrm{base}} we trained, \textrm{KERM}_{\textrm{base}} shows a significant improvement on both two query sets. This indicates the explicit introduction of external knowledge can alleviate the semantic gap and heterogeneity between query and passage, and improve the semantic matching performance."
Why does existing knowledge enhanced PLMs (such as CokeBERT and CoLake) cannot be used directly for re-ranking tasks?,"Existing knowledge-enhanced PLMs, such as CokeBERT and CoLake, are not directly suitable for re-ranking tasks because they are designed primarily for other NLP tasks, such as semantic relevance and entity-level information, and do not specifically target the relevance modeling between query and passage","While approaches like CokeBERT and CoLake integrate sophisticated knowledge into PLMs through knowledge graphs, they did not focus specifically on using knowledge to empower PLMs for re-ranking tasks. The reasons for why CokeBERT or CoLake cannot be directly used in re-ranking cannot be answered from this paper.","Existing KE-PLMs can be categorized by the granularity of knowledge they incorporate from knowledge graph (KG), as text-based knowledge, entity knowledge and KG meta-graphs.To integrate text-based knowledge, RAG (Lewiset al., 2020) and KIF (Fanet al., 2020) first retrieve top-k documents from Wikipedia using KNN-based retrieval, and the PLM model is employed to generate the output conditioned on these retrieved documents. Entity-level information can be highly useful for a variety of natural language understanding tasks. Hence, many existing KE-PLMs target this type of simple yet powerful knowledge. ERNIE(BAIDU) (Sun et al., 2019) introduces a new pre-training strategy of language model which masking phrases or entities in order to implicitly learn both synaptic and semantic knowledge from these units. ERNIE(THU) (Zhanget al., 2019) integrates informative entity representations in the knowledge module into the underlying layers of the semantic module based on the alignments between text and entity to equip the model with the ability of knowledge awareness. As knowledge graphs provide richer information than simply entity, more and more researchers start to explore integration of more sophisticated knowledge, such as meta-graphs in KG. CokeBERT (Su et al., 2021) proposes a novel semantic-driven Graph Neural Network (GNN) to dynamically select contextual knowledge and embed knowledge context according to textual context for PLMs, which can avoid the effect of redundant and ambiguous knowledge in KGs that cannot match the input text.CoLake (Sunet al., 2020a) also uses GNN to aggregate information from the constructed meta-graph in both pre-training and inference. CoLake converts the meta-graph into token sequence and appends it to input sequence for PLMs, which is distinctive to CokeBERT. Although extensive research has been proposed up to now to address the knowledge-aware problem, none exists which constrained on how to use knowledge to empower PLMs particularly for re-ranking tasks. Different from existing knowledge-enhanced PLMs for other NLP tasks, our aim for the re-ranking task is particularly on the relevance modeling between query and passage.Thus, we further leverage the knowledge in the global graph \overline{\mathcal{G}} to construct “bridges” between query and passage, which alleviates the semantic gap and improves semantic modeling.More specifically, for a given query-passage pair (i.e., (\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})), we propose to construct a bipartite meta-graph that connects those entities in the \mathbf{q} and those in \mathbf{p}."
Would there be a performance gain if the model utilizes the IE (information extraction) model instead of the exact match for target entity recognition?,"Yes.

By utilizing an IE model instead of exact match for target entity recognition, the model can potentially gain performance by capturing more informative entities that may not be exactly matched in the query or passage. This can lead to more accurate and informative paths being discovered in the knowledge graph, which can improve the re-ranking performance","This work’s approach aims at focusing mostly on informative factors. For example, the key sentence selection module focused on extracting only the most relevant sentences and the target entity recognition module focused on identifying only the most informative entities. Further, this work argues that, to use knowledge graphs for re-ranking tasks, it is important that the graphs contain triplets with substantial information gain. The effect on information gain from using IE models, instead of exact match, for target entity recognition cannot be answered from this paper.","(1)Key sentence selection.

Note that we only keep the within-K-hop paths that might be the most useful for the downstream re-ranking task. Meanwhile, the knowledge could be complemented from the K-hop paths. • Challenge 1. Existing knowledge graph are not constructed for re-ranking task. They usually contain trivial factual triples, which can hardly bring information gain. The inappropriate selection of external knowledge could even jeopardize the re-ranker performance. How to utilize existing knowledge graph to re-ranking task is remain a challenge. • Challenge 2. The explicit knowledge and implicit knowledge are highly heterogeneous due to the different sources, which makes the aggregation of the two difficult. How to mutually refine each other and effectively aggregate explicit knowledge into implicit knowledge to alleviate the semantic gap between query and passage is still a challenge."
How does TransE learns entity and relatio embeddings in unsupervised way?,TransE learns entity and relation embeddings in an unsupervised way by modeling the latent distribution of knowledge in a given knowledge graph,TransE is an unsupervised learning method that learns latent representations for a knowledge triplet. The method in which TransE learns these latent representations cannot be answered from this paper.,"Given a global knowledge graph \mathcal{G}, the first step is to eliminate those knowledge that might be noisy to be applied. To achieve this, we use TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) to measure the reliability of a given knowledge triplet. In particular, TransE is an unsupervised learning method that learns latent representations for a knowledge triplet (e_{h},r,e_{t}). Intuitively, it models the latent distribution of knowledge in a given knowledge graph, and those who are out of this distribution can be viewed as less informative knowledge, which should not be used. Based on this,we use the entity embeddings pre-trained by TransE to calculate a distance metric between two linked entities as(3)Rel_{e}(e_{h},r,e_{t})=\mathbf{E}({e_{h}})\cdot\mathbf{E}(r)+\mathbf{E}({e_{h}})\cdot\mathbf{E}({e_{t}})+\mathbf{E}({r})\cdot\mathbf{E}({e_{t}}),(4)Dist(e_{h},e_{t})=\frac{1}{Rel_{e}(e_{h},r,e_{t})},where \mathbf{E}({e}) and \mathbf{E}({r}) are the TransE embeddings of entity and relation, respectively, and the inner product measures the relevance between two vectors. As the objective of TranE is aligned with minimizing the distance shown in Eq.(4), we can consider those knowledge triplets with small distance values as informative knowledge."

High accuracy is crucial for safety in autonomous vehicles. Would deploying smaller models using over-the-air updates in Tesla result in a trade-off with accuracy(and hence safety)?,"NO.

Smaller models with equivalent accuracy as AlexNet can be deployed using over-the-air updates in Tesla without compromising safety. The advantages of smaller models, such as more efficient distributed training, less overhead when exporting new models to clients, and feasible FPGA and embedded deployment, outweigh any potential accuracy trade-offs","Accuracy is crucial for safety but it's not only accuracy vs size relation. We should consider more aspects. For example, response time of a driving car system is very crucial for safety. Communication overhead between servers while model training increases with the size of the model so smaller models train faster. Updating models from company servers to the car or over-the-air updates based on AlexNet at that time would require 240MB of communication from the server to the car. Hence, smaller models require less communication, making frequent updates more feasible. Also, keeping in mind architectural designs such as adjusting some functionalities, introducing new ways of extracting features, or using different objectives and optimizers may make a small model achieve the same level of accuracy or even surpass the larger model; for instance, SqueezeNet is 50x smaller than AlexNet with equivalent accuracy.","Much of the recent research on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has focused on increasing accuracy on computer vision datasets.For a given accuracy level, there typically exist multiple CNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level.Given equivalent accuracy, a CNN architecture with fewer parameters has several advantages:\bulletMore efficient distributed training.Communication among servers is the limiting factor to the scalability of distributed CNN training.For distributed data-parallel training, communication overhead is directly proportional to the number of parameters in the model Iandola et al.

What is an example of model compression approaches?,"Model compression approaches include SVD-based compression, Network Pruning, quantization, and huffman encoding","different examples can be: Applying SVD to a pretrained CNN model through which we can obtain most effective parameters or features of largest singular values of this factorization if we want. Information reconstruction of a matrix factorized with SVD  allow decreasing its rank, hence decreasing the memory allocated to save the vectors of these parameters . Also Network Pruning, which begins with a pretrained model, then replaces parameters that are below a certain threshold with zeros to form a sparse matrix, and finally performs a few iterations of training on the sparse CNN Maybe seen as another example . Deep compression -utilizing Huffman encoding, Network Pruning and quantization- yet is a third example.","The overarching goal of our work is to identify a model that has very few parameters while preserving accuracy.To address this problem, a sensible approach is to take an existing CNN model and compress it in a lossy fashion.In fact, a research community has emerged around the topic of model compression, and several approaches have been reported.A fairly straightforward approach by Denton et al. is to apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to a pretrained CNN model Denton et al. (2014).Han et al. developed Network Pruning, which begins with a pretrained model, then replaces parameters that are below a certain threshold with zeros to form a sparse matrix, and finally performs a few iterations of training on the sparse CNN Han et al. (2015b).Recently, Han et al. extended their work by combining Network Pruning with quantization (to 8 bits or less) and huffman encoding to create an approach called Deep Compression Han et al. (2015a), and further designed a hardware accelerator called EIE Han et al. (2016a) that operates directly on the compressed model, achieving substantial speedups and energy savings."
"What is an example of a ""module"" in CNN?","An example of a ""module"" in CNN is the Inception module, which is a building block composed of multiple convolutional layers with different fixed dimensions, such as 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, and 1x3, 3x1","a module can be thought of as a block of some several layers may be of different filter sizes and dimensions to perform some specific functionality. Many such modules are then combined to form a complete network. For example, Inception modules, which are comprised of a number of different dimensionalities of filters, like 1x1 and 3x3, sometimes 5x5, 1x3 and 3x1.","With the trend of designing very deep CNNs, it becomes cumbersome to manually select filter dimensions for each layer.To address this, various higher level building blocks, or modules, comprised of multiple convolution layers with a specific fixed organization have been proposed.For example, the GoogLeNet papers propose Inception modules, which are comprised of a number of different dimensionalities of filters, usually including 1x1 and 3x3, plus sometimes 5x5 Szegedy et al. (2014) and sometimes 1x3 and 3x1 Szegedy et al. (2015).Many such modules are then combined, perhaps with additional ad-hoc layers, to form a complete network.We use the term CNN microarchitecture to refer to the particular organization and dimensions of the individual modules."
What is an example of a DSE approach?,Bayesian optimization,"An example of DSE approach can be  Bayesian optimization, simulated annealing, randomized search or genetic algorithms and all tend to develop automated approaches to find NN architectures exhibiting higher accuracy.","Neural networks (including deep and convolutional NNs) have a large design space, with numerous options for microarchitectures, macroarchitectures, solvers, and other hyperparameters.It seems natural that the community would want to gain intuition about how these factors impact a NN’s accuracy (i.e. the shape of the design space).Much of the work on design space exploration (DSE) of NNs has focused on developing automated approaches for finding NN architectures that deliver higher accuracy.These automated DSE approaches include bayesian optimization Snoek et al. (2012), simulated annealing Ludermir et al. (2006), randomized search Bergstra & Bengio (2012), and genetic algorithms Stanley & Miikkulainen (2002).To their credit, each of these papers provides a case in which the proposed DSE approach produces a NN architecture that achieves higher accuracy compared to a representative baseline.However, these papers make no attempt to provide intuition about the shape of the NN design space.Later in this paper, we eschew automated approaches – instead, we refactor CNNs in such a way that we can do principled A/B comparisons to investigate how CNN architectural decisions influence model size and accuracy."
What is the ratio of 1x1 filters in the total number of filters?,The ratio of 1x1 filters in the total number of filters is e_{1x1}/(e_{1x1} + e_{3x3}),"The question needs to be related to some certain context but if we consider asking about the ratio of 1*1 filters in each fire module then the answer would be as follows: for a fire module ratio of 1*1 filters w.r.t. all filters can be calculated as (s1x1+e1x1)/(s1x1+e1x1+e3x3) where; s1x1 is the number of filters in the squeeze layer,e1x1 is the number of 1x1 filters in the expand layer, and e3x3 is the number of 3x3 filters in the expand layer. It is also worth to mention that s1x1 is to be less than (e1x1 + e3x3), so the squeeze layer helps to limit the number of input channels to the 3x3 filters.","We define the Fire module as follows.A Fire module is comprised of: a squeeze convolution layer (which has only 1x1 filters), feeding into an expand layer that has a mix of 1x1 and 3x3 convolution filters; we illustrate this in Figure 1.The liberal use of 1x1 filters in Fire modules is an application of Strategy 1 from Section 3.1.We expose three tunable dimensions (hyperparameters) in a Fire module: s_{1x1}, e_{1x1}, and e_{3x3}.In a Fire module, s_{1x1} is the number of filters in the squeeze layer (all 1x1), e_{1x1} is the number of 1x1 filters in the expand layer, and e_{3x3} is the number of 3x3 filters in the expand layer.When we use Fire modules we set s_{1x1} to be less than (e_{1x1} + e_{3x3}), so the squeeze layer helps to limit the number of input channels to the 3x3 filters, as per Strategy 2 from Section 3.1."
"How does the choice of layers, in which to downsample, affect the size of activation maps?","The choice of layers in which to downsample affects the size of activation maps by controlling the spatial resolution of the output. Downsampling early in the network results in smaller activation maps, while downsampling late in the network preserves larger activation maps","As we can see, downsampling aim to collect summary about statistics of different regions of some feature map, and this can be addressed with stride >1 in convolution or pooling layers which affects the size of activation map. If early layers  have large strides, then most layers will have small activation maps and if most layers in the network have a stride of 1, and the strides greater than 1 are later in the network, then many layers in the network will have large activation maps.","Strategy 3. Downsample late in the network so that convolution layers have large activation maps.In a convolutional network, each convolution layer produces an output activation map with a spatial resolution that is at least 1x1 and often much larger than 1x1.The height and width of these activation maps are controlled by: (1) the size of the input data (e.g. 256x256 images) and (2) the choice of layers in which to downsample in the CNN architecture.Most commonly, downsampling is engineered into CNN architectures by setting the (stride > 1) in some of the convolution or pooling layers (e.g. Szegedy et al. (2014); Simonyan & Zisserman (2014); Krizhevsky et al. (2012)).If early333In our terminology, an “early” layer is close to the input data. layers in the network have large strides, then most layers will have small activation maps.Conversely, if most layers in the network have a stride of 1, and the strides greater than 1 are concentrated toward the end444In our terminology, the “end” of the network is the classifier. of the network, then many layers in the network will have large activation maps.Our intuition is that large activation maps (due to delayed downsampling) can lead to higher classification accuracy, with all else held equal.Indeed, K. He and H. Sun applied delayed downsampling to four different CNN architectures, and in each case delayed downsampling led to higher classification accuracy He & Sun (2015)."
Why did the authors use a mix of 1x1 and 3x3 filters in the expand layer of fire module?,"To maintain a small total number of parameters in a CNN, the authors use a mix of 1x1 and 3x3 filters in the expand layer of the Fire module, as described in Strategy 2 of Section 3.1. By using 1x1 filters, the number of input channels to the 3x3 filters is decreased, which helps to limit the total number of parameters in the layer","Authors used a mix of 1x1 and 3x3 filters in the expand layer of the fire module to reduce the number of parameters while still getting benefits from the desired properties of having reasonable scope of the input receptive field and extracting correlations and useful information by applying the 3*3 filters of the CNN. To have a small number of parameters in a CNN, we need to decrease the number of input channels to the 3x3 filters and here comes the role of 1*1 filters, while the 3x3 filters are used to capture larger spatial features (Assuming only 3*3 and 1*1 kernels). This way, the model get its wide fame of achieving a high level of accuracy with fewer parameters than other networks.","Strategy 2. Decrease the number of input channels to 3x3 filters.Consider a convolution layer that is comprised entirely of 3x3 filters.The total quantity of parameters in this layer is (number of input channels) * (number of filters) * (3*3).So, to maintain a small total number of parameters in a CNN, it is important not only to decrease the number of 3x3 filters (see Strategy 1 above), but also to decrease the number of input channels to the 3x3 filters.We decrease the number of input channels to 3x3 filters using squeeze layers, which we describe in the next section.  We define the Fire module as follows.A Fire module is comprised of: a squeeze convolution layer (which has only 1x1 filters), feeding into an expand layer that has a mix of 1x1 and 3x3 convolution filters; we illustrate this in Figure 1.The liberal use of 1x1 filters in Fire modules is an application of Strategy 1 from Section 3.1.We expose three tunable dimensions (hyperparameters) in a Fire module: s_{1x1}, e_{1x1}, and e_{3x3}.In a Fire module, s_{1x1} is the number of filters in the squeeze layer (all 1x1), e_{1x1} is the number of 1x1 filters in the expand layer, and e_{3x3} is the number of 3x3 filters in the expand layer.When we use Fire modules we set s_{1x1} to be less than (e_{1x1} + e_{3x3}), so the squeeze layer helps to limit the number of input channels to the 3x3 filters, as per Strategy 2 from Section 3.1."

"The Caffe framework does not natively support a convolution layer that contains multiple filter resolutions .To get around this, the authors implement the expand layer with two separate convolution layers. What is the additional cost incurred by using two convolution layers?",Increased computational cost due to concatenating the outputs of two separate convolution layers,"The additional cost of using 2 convolutional layers may be that the parameters of the 2 layers are now trained separately; they are not benefiting from each other being jointly optimized to perform some task and share useful information between each other while training, but output shape is still not affected by the separation i.e.,this is numerically equivalent to have one layer that contains both 1x1 and 3x3 filters.","\bulletSo that the output activations from 1x1 and 3x3 filters have the same height and width, we add a 1-pixel border of zero-padding in the input data to 3x3 filters of expand modules.\bulletReLU Nair & Hinton (2010) is applied to activations from squeeze and expand layers.\bulletDropout Srivastava et al.

Then, we concatenate the outputs of these layers together in the channel dimension. This is numerically equivalent to implementing one layer that contains both 1x1 and 3x3 filters."
Did the authors use AlexNet for evaluation of SqueezeNet?,Yes,"Yes, as told by authors that they used AlexNet and the associated model compression results as a basis for comparison when evaluating SqueezeNet.","We now turn our attention to evaluating SqueezeNet.In each of the CNN model compression papers reviewed in Section 2.1, the goal was to compress an AlexNet Krizhevsky et al. (2012) model that was trained to classify images using the ImageNet Deng et al. (2009) (ILSVRC 2012) dataset.Therefore, we use AlexNet555Our baseline is bvlc_alexnet from the Caffe codebase Jia et al. (2014). and the associated model compression results as a basis for comparison when evaluating SqueezeNet."
How would the effectiveness of SqueezeNet's model compression be affected if a significantly smaller CNN is used instead of AlexNet?,The effectiveness of SqueezeNet's model compression would likely be even more significant if a significantly smaller CNN is used instead of AlexNet,"by combining CNN architectural innovation (SqueezeNet) with state-of-the-art compression techniques (Deep Compression), we achieved a 510× reduction in model size with no decrease in accuracy compared
to the baseline.","In addition, these results demonstrate that Deep Compression Han et al. (2015a) not only works well on CNN architectures with many parameters (e.g. AlexNet and VGG), but it is also able to compress the already compact, fully convolutional SqueezeNet architecture.Deep Compression compressed SqueezeNet by 10×10\times10 × while preserving the baseline accuracy.In summary: by combining CNN architectural innovation (SqueezeNet) with state-of-the-art compression techniques (Deep Compression), we achieved a 510×510\times510 × reduction in model size with no decrease in accuracy compared to the baseline."
"What was the size of model obtained by applying Deep Compression 
to SqueezeNet, using 33% sparsity and 8-bit quantization?",0.66 MB,size after taking these considerations would be a 0.66 MB model 363× smaller than 32-bit AlexNet with equivalent accuracy to AlexNet.,"It appears that we have surpassed the state-of-the-art results from the model compression community:even when using uncompressed 32-bit values to represent the model, SqueezeNet has a 1.4×1.4\times1.4 × smaller model size than the best efforts from the model compression community while maintaining or exceeding the baseline accuracy.Until now, an open question has been: are small models amenable to compression, or do small models “need” all of the representational power afforded by dense floating-point values?To find out, we applied Deep Compression Han et al. (2015a) to SqueezeNet, using 33% sparsity666Note that, due to the storage overhead of storing sparse matrix indices, 33% sparsity leads to somewhat less than a 3×3\times3 × decrease in model size. and 8-bit quantization.This yields a 0.66 MB model (363×363\times363 × smaller than 32-bit AlexNet) with equivalent accuracy to AlexNet.Further, applying Deep Compression with 6-bit quantization and 33% sparsity on SqueezeNet, we produce a 0.47MB model (510×510\times510 × smaller than 32-bit AlexNet) with equivalent accuracy.Our small model is indeed amenable to compression."
"To investigate the effect of the squeeze ratio on model size and accuracy, were the models fine-tuned or trained from scratch?",Trained from scratch,"To investigate the effect of the squeeze ratio on model size, models were trained from scratch so that one can make comparisons for these separate models.","In these experiments, we use SqueezeNet (Figure 2) as a starting point.As in SqueezeNet, these experiments use the following metaparameters: base_{e}=128, incr_{e}=128, pct_{3x3}=0.5, and freq=2.We train multiple models, where each model has a different squeeze ratio (SR)777Note that, for a given model, all Fire layers share the same squeeze ratio. in the range [0.125, 1.0].In Figure 3(a), we show the results of this experiment, where each point on the graph is an independent model that was trained from scratch.SqueezeNet is the SR=0.125 point in this figure.888Note that we named it SqueezeNet because it has a low squeeze ratio (SR). That is, the squeeze layers in SqueezeNet have 0.125x the number of filters as the expand layers.From this figure, we learn that increasing SR beyond 0.125 can further increase ImageNet top-5 accuracy from 80.3% (i.e. AlexNet-level) with a 4.8MB model to 86.0% with a 19MB model.Accuracy plateaus at 86.0% with SR=0.75 (a 19MB model), and setting SR=1.0 further increases model size without improving accuracy."
Does complex bypass connections add extra parameters to the model?,Yes,"Yes, complex bypass connections add extra parameters to the model as we add 1x1 convolution layer with the number of filters set equal to the number of output channels.","One limitation is that, in the straightforward case, the number of input channels and number of output channels has to be the same; as a result, only half of the Fire modules can have simple bypass connections, as shown in the middle diagram of Fig 2.When the “same number of channels” requirement can’t be met, we use a complex bypass connection, as illustrated on the right of Figure 2.While a simple bypass is “just a wire,” we define a complex bypass as a bypass that includes a 1x1 convolution layer with the number of filters set equal to the number of output channels that are needed.Note that complex bypass connections add extra parameters to the model, while simple bypass connections do not."
The paper mentions that SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet. Was the accuracy exactly the same as AlexNet or roughly the same?,Roughly the same,"It is the same as AlexNet and SqueezeNet maybe,exceed it for some experimental cases.","In Table 2, we review SqueezeNet in the context of recent model compression results.The SVD-based approach is able to compress a pretrained AlexNet model by a factor of 5x, while diminishing top-1 accuracy to 56.0% Denton et al. (2014).Network Pruning achieves a 9x reduction in model size while maintaining the baseline of 57.2% top-1 and 80.3% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet Han et al. (2015b).Deep Compression achieves a 35x reduction in model size while still maintaining the baseline accuracy level Han et al. (2015a).Now, with SqueezeNet, we achieve a 50X reduction in model size compared to AlexNet, while meeting or exceeding the top-1 and top-5 accuracy of AlexNet.We summarize all of the aforementioned results in Table 2."
 Why did the simple bypass achieve a higher accuracy improvement than complex bypass?,"The simple bypass achieved a higher accuracy improvement than the complex bypass because it allowed the network to learn more robust features by adding direct connections between layers, bypassing the complex non-linear transformations in the network","This was one of the experimental investigations that was interesting. We can see the answer in simple bypass (wire) as it resemble residual connections which help in keeping considerable gradient values needed for precise learning specially while going deeper. Also, complex bypass adds more parameters which increases the number of parameters trained for the same task on the same data(it may have some small overfitting side effect ).","The choice of connections across multiple layers or modules is an emerging area of CNN macroarchitectural research.Residual Networks (ResNet) He et al. (2015b) and Highway Networks Srivastava et al. (2015) each propose the use of connections that skip over multiple layers, for example additively connecting the activations from layer 3 to the activations from layer 6.We refer to these connections as bypass connections.The authors of ResNet provide an A/B comparison of a 34-layer CNN with and without bypass connections; adding bypass connections delivers a 2 percentage-point improvement on Top-5 ImageNet accuracy."
The goal of authors regarding microarchitectural design space was to understand the impact of CNN architectural choices on model size and accuracy. Were they able to draw a conclusive impact?,"Yes, the authors were able to draw a conclusive impact of CNN architectural choices on model size and accuracy through their experiments and analysis","They come to an impact that the size of the model can be reduced while still obtaining same or higher accuracy with fewer parameters through manipulating architectural design strategies as is the case in their architecture -SqueezeNet. Although the authors rather design and execute experiments with the goal of providing intuitions about the shape of the microarchitectural design space with respect to the design strategies they proposed, SqueezeNet and other models reside in a broad and largely unexplored design
space of CNN architectures that need more investigations","As you can see, there are several advantages of smaller CNN architectures.With this in mind, we focus directly on the problem of identifying a CNN architecture with fewer parameters but equivalent accuracy compared to a well-known model.We have discovered such an architecture, which we call SqueezeNet.In addition, we present our attempt at a more disciplined approach to searching the design space for novel CNN architectures. In this section, we design and execute experiments with the goal of providing intuition about the shape of the microarchitectural design space with respect to the design strategies that we proposed in Section 3.1.Note that our goal here is not to maximize accuracy in every experiment, but rather to understand the impact of CNN architectural choices on model size and accuracy."
How YoloV3 calculates the sizes of the anchor boxes?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

YoloV3 calculates the sizes of the anchor boxes using dimension clusters",The authors they tried multiples of the initial anchor sizes specified by the 9 clusters. The clusters as specified at the cell D58.,"Anchor box x,y offset predictions. We tried using the normal anchor box prediction mechanism where you predict the x,y offset as a multiple of the box width or height using a linear activation. We found this formulation decreased model stability and didn’t work very well. Following YOLO9000 our system predicts bounding boxes using dimension clusters as anchor boxes [15]. The network predicts 4 coordinates for each bounding box, t_{x}, t_{y}, t_{w}, t_{h}. If the cell is offset from the top left corner of the image by (c_{x},c_{y}) and the bounding box prior has width and height p_{w}, p_{h}, then the predictions correspond to:"
How many total bounding boxes are predicted by YOLOv3 for all three scales?,3N,The answer is nine as there are three predictions for three different scales.,"YOLOv3 predicts boxes at 3 different scales. Our system extracts features from those scales using a similar concept to feature pyramid networks [8]. From our base feature extractor we add several convolutional layers. The last of these predicts a 3-d tensor encoding bounding box, objectness, and class predictions. In our experiments with COCO [10] we predict 3 boxes at each scale so the tensor is N\times N\times[3*(4+1+80)] for the 4 bounding box offsets, 1 objectness prediction, and 80 class predictions."
How the YOLOv3 algorithm calculates the coordinates of the predicted box from anchor box and output coordinates?,YOLOv3 calculates the coordinates of the predicted box from the anchor box and output coordinates by transforming the output coordinates using the anchor box's transformation matrix,"The question is partially answered as ""If the cell is offset from the top left corner of the image by (c_{x},c_{y}) and the bounding box prior has width and height p_{w}, p_{h}, then the predictions correspond to:"", but is completely answered in the continuation of the paper (in the expression).","Following YOLO9000 our system predicts bounding boxes using dimension clusters as anchor boxes [15].

Which data augmentation techniques YoloV3 algorithm used during training?,"Multi-scale training, data augmentation, batch normalization","They use augmentation, mention it only once in the paper, and this is the place. No additional details about data augmentation.","We still train on full images with no hard negative mining or any of that stuff.

Our new network is a hybrid approach between the network used in YOLOv2, Darknet-19, and that newfangled residual network stuff.

It has 53 convolutional layers so we call it…. wait for it….. Darknet-53!"
Why the YoloV3 performs poorly with higher values of AP when compared with RetinaNet?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

YOLOv3 struggles to get the boxes perfectly aligned with the object, which leads to a drop in performance as the IOU threshold increases",YOLOv3 performs poorly because ot struggles to get the perfect bounding box alignment with the objects.,"However, when we look at the “old” detection metric of mAP at IOU=.5 (or AP{}_{50} in the chart) YOLOv3 is very strong. It is almost on par with RetinaNet and far above the SSD variants. This indicates that YOLOv3 is a very strong detector that excels at producing decent boxes for objects. However, performance drops significantly as the IOU threshold increases indicating YOLOv3 struggles to get the boxes perfectly aligned with the object."
Why the focal loss strategy did not worked for the authors? ,"Sure! Here's the answer to the question based on the provided context:

The focal loss strategy did not work for the authors because YOLOv3 already has separate objectness predictions and conditional class predictions, which mitigates the problem that focal loss is trying to solve, resulting in little loss from class predictions for most examples",The authors hypothesize that YOLOv3 may already be robust to the problem which the focal loss is tryin to solve because it has spearate objectness predictions and conditional class predictions. That is why adding the focal loss did not improve the performance of YOLOv3.,Focal loss. We tried using focal loss. It dropped our mAP about 2 points. YOLOv3 may already be robust to the problem focal loss is trying to solve because it has separate objectness predictions and conditional class predictions. Thus for most examples there is no loss from the class predictions? Or something? We aren’t totally sure.
YOLO detectors are now being used everywhere including both civil and military use. As a researcher how much authors should be concerned on positive and negative use of their research work? ,"Authors should be concerned about both positive and negative uses of their research work, as computer vision technology can be applied in various ways, some of which may have unintended consequences or be used for harmful purposes. It is important for researchers to consider the potential impact of their work and take steps to mitigate any negative effects","A sarcastic comment means a concern for authors that Google, Facebook, and similar corporations use these kind of models to harvest and use our personal information. A similar sarcastic comment regarding military. The authors should be responsible for their work and consider possible consequences to the world.","But maybe a better question is: “What are we going to do with these detectors now that we have them?” A lot of the people doing this research are at Google and Facebook. I guess at least we know the technology is in good hands and definitely won’t be used to harvest your personal information and sell it to…. wait, you’re saying that’s exactly what it will be used for?? Oh. Well the other people heavily funding vision research are the military and they’ve never done anything horrible like killing lots of people with new technology oh wait…..111The author is funded by the Office of Naval Research and Google. I have a lot of hope that most of the people using computer vision are just doing happy, good stuff with it, like counting the number of zebras in a national park [13], or tracking their cat as it wanders around their house [19]. But computer vision is already being put to questionable use and as researchers we have a responsibility to at least consider the harm our work might be doing and think of ways to mitigate it. We owe the world that much."
What are some of the limitations of the YOLOv3 object detection model?,"YOLOv3 has limitations in terms of object alignment and performance on medium to large size objects, and struggles with the COCO average AP metric between.5 and.95 IOU","Some of the limitations of YOLOv3, based on the information given in the paper are: it is still quite a bit behind other models like RetinaNet in the ""COCO's weired average mAP"" metric (COCO average AP between 95 IOU metric), performance drops significantly as the IOU threshold increases indicating YOLOv3 struggles to get the boxes perfectly aligned with the object, it has comparatively worse performance on medium and larger size objects.","YOLOv3 is pretty good! See table 3. In terms of COCOs weird average mean AP metric it is on par with the SSD variants but is 3×3\times3 × faster. It is still quite a bit behind other models like RetinaNet in this metric though. However, when we look at the “old” detection metric of mAP at IOU=.5 (or AP{}_{50} in the chart) YOLOv3 is very strong. It is almost on par with RetinaNet and far above the SSD variants. This indicates that YOLOv3 is a very strong detector that excels at producing decent boxes for objects. However, performance drops significantly as the IOU threshold increases indicating YOLOv3 struggles to get the boxes perfectly aligned with the object. In the past YOLO struggled with small objects. However, now we see a reversal in that trend. With the new multi-scale predictions we see YOLOv3 has relatively high AP{}_{S} performance. However, it has comparatively worse performance on medium and larger size objects. More investigation is needed to get to the bottom of this. YOLOv3 is a good detector. It’s fast, it’s accurate. It’s not as great on the COCO average AP between .5 and .95 IOU metric. But it’s very good on the old detection metric of .5 IOU."
Compare accuracy and speed of Darknet-53 with ResNet-101.,Darknet-53 is faster and has similar accuracy to ResNet-101,Darknet-53 is better than ResNet-101 and 1.5×1.5\times1.5 × faster.,"Each network is trained with identical settings and tested at 256\times 256, single crop accuracy. Run times are measured on a Titan X at 256\times 256. Thus Darknet-53 performs on par with state-of-the-art classifiers but with fewer floating point operations and more speed. Darknet-53 is better than ResNet-101 and 1.5×1.5\times1.5 × faster. Darknet-53 has similar performance to ResNet-152 and is 2×2\times2 × faster. Darknet-53 also achieves the highest measured floating point operations per second. This means the network structure better utilizes the GPU, making it more efficient to evaluate and thus faster. That’s mostly because ResNets have just way too many layers and aren’t very efficient."
In its loss function YoloV3 uses logistic regression with multilabel classification or Softmax over all class probabilities?,Logistic regression with multilabel classification,The authors use binary cross-entropy loss.,"Each box predicts the classes the bounding box may contain using multilabel classification. We do not use a softmax as we have found it is unnecessary for good performance, instead we simply use independent logistic classifiers. During training we use binary cross-entropy loss for the class predictions."
"YoloV3 is most suited for small, medium or large size objects?","Sure! Here's my answer:

Small size objects","YOLOv3 now struggles more with medium and larger size objects, i.e., performs worse than before. On the other hand, it is more succesful for smaller objects.","In the past YOLO struggled with small objects. However, now we see a reversal in that trend. With the new multi-scale predictions we see YOLOv3 has relatively high AP{}_{S} performance. However, it has comparatively worse performance on medium and larger size objects. More investigation is needed to get to the bottom of this."
How does YOLOv3 improve upon previous versions of the YOLO object detection algorithm?,"YOLOv3 improves upon previous versions of the YOLO object detection algorithm by incorporating a hybrid approach of 3x3 and 1x1 convolutional layers, shortcut connections, and a larger network size (53 convolutional layers) resulting in faster and more accurate object detection",YOLOv3 is faster and better than YOLO. It has more layers. The authors also tried some small tricks and experiments which further improved the overall performance.,"We use a new network for performing feature extraction. Our new network is a hybrid approach between the network used in YOLOv2, Darknet-19, and that newfangled residual network stuff. Our network uses successive 3\times 3 and 1\times 1 convolutional layers but now has some shortcut connections as well and is significantly larger. It has 53 convolutional layers so we call it…. wait for it….. Darknet-53! When we plot accuracy vs speed on the AP{}_{50} metric (see figure 5) we see YOLOv3 has significant benefits over other detection systems. Namely, it’s faster and better. So here’s the deal with YOLOv3: We mostly took good ideas from other people. We also trained a new classifier network that’s better than the other ones. We’ll just take you through the whole system from scratch so you can understand it all."
"In paper authors make the predictions at three different scales, but what is advantage of making object detections at different scales?","The advantage of making object detections at different scales is that it allows the model to benefit from prior computation and fine-grained features, improving performance on small objects, while still maintaining comparable performance on medium and larger size objects","By using multi-scaled prediction, YOLOv3 has improved performance for small objects. Also, the subsequent scales benefit from previous scales and the previous features from earlier layers.","We perform the same design one more time to predict boxes for the final scale. Thus our predictions for the 3rd scale benefit from all the prior computation as well as fine-grained features from early on in the network. In the past YOLO struggled with small objects. However, now we see a reversal in that trend. With the new multi-scale predictions we see YOLOv3 has relatively high AP{}_{S} performance. However, it has comparatively worse performance on medium and larger size objects. More investigation is needed to get to the bottom of this."
How would the loss function of YoloV3 look after changing Mean squared errors with the logistic regression cross-entropy error terms?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The loss function of YoloV3 would change from binary cross-entropy loss to logistic regression cross-entropy error terms",Binary cross-entropy is used for the class predictions. Logistic activation is used and is better than the linear activation.,"Linear x,y predictions instead of logistic. We tried using a linear activation to directly predict the x,y offset instead of the logistic activation. This led to a couple point drop in mAP. Each box predicts the classes the bounding box may contain using multilabel classification. We do not use a softmax as we have found it is unnecessary for good performance, instead we simply use independent logistic classifiers. During training we use binary cross-entropy loss for the class predictions."
How many different types of experiments are performed to test the proposed models?,"4.

The four experiments performed to test the proposed models are:

1. Training on moving MNIST digits.
2. Training on natural image patches.
3. Testing the model's ability to deal with out-of-domain inputs (one and three moving digits).
4. Visualizing the features learned by the model","5 different types of experiments are performed to test the proposed models. They are Generalization over time scales, Experiments on MNIST, Experiments on Natural Image Patches, Out-of-domain Inputs, and Visualizing Features.","Generalization over time scalesIn the next experiment, we test if the model can work at time scales that aredifferent than what it was trained on. We take a one hidden layer unconditionedComposite Model trained on moving MNIST digits. The model has 2048 LSTM unitsand looks at a 64 \times 64 input. It was trained on input sequences of 10frames to reconstruct those 10 frames as well as predict 10 frames into thefuture. In order to test if the future predictor is able to generalize beyond 10frames, we let the model run for 100 steps into the future.Fig. 7(a) shows the pattern of activity in the LSTM units of thefuture predictorpathway for a randomly chosen test input. It shows the activity at each of thethree sigmoidal gates (input, forget, output), the input (after the tanhnon-linearity, before being multiplied by the input gate), the cell state andthe final output (after being multiplied by the output gate). Even though theunits are ordered randomly along the vertical axis, we can see that the dynamicshas a periodic quality to it. The model is able to generate persistent motionfor long periods of time. In terms of reconstruction, the model only outputsblobs after the first 15 frames, but the motion is relatively well preserved.More results, including long range future predictions over hundreds of time steps can see been athttp://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nitish/unsupervised_video.To show that setting up a periodic behaviour is not trivial,Fig. 7(b) shows the activity from a randomly initialized futurepredictor. Here, the LSTM state quickly converges and the outputs blur completely. Experiments on MNIST; We first trained our models on a dataset of moving MNIST digits. In this dataset, each video was 20 frames long and consisted of two digits moving inside a 64 × 64 patch. The digits were chosen randomly from the training set and placed initially at random locations inside the patch. Experiments on Natural Image Patches; Next, we tried to see if our models can also work with natural image patches. For this, we trained the models on sequences of 32 × 32 natural image patches extracted from the UCF-101 dataset. In this case, we used linear output units and the squared error loss function. Out-of-domain Inputs; Next, we test this model’s ability to deal with out-of domain inputs. For this, we test the model on sequences of one and three moving digits. The model was trained on sequences of two moving digits, so it has never seen inputs with just one digit or three digits. Visualizing Features; Next, we visualize the features learned by this model. Fig. 9 shows the weights that connect each input frame to the encoder LSTM. There are four sets of weights. One set of weights connects the frame to the input units. There are three other sets, one corresponding to each of the three gates (input, forget and output). Each weight has a size of 64 × 64."
Which variants of LSTM encoder-decoder models are used in this study?,"The variants of LSTM encoder-decoder models used in this study are:

1. Conditional LSTM decoder, conditioned on the last generated frame.
2. Unconditional LSTM decoder, not conditioned on any previous frames","Future Predictor, Composite Model, Conditional Future Predictor, Composite Model with Conditional Future Predictor are the variants of LSTM encoder-decoder models are used in this study.","Another natural unsupervised learning task for sequences is predicting thefuture. This is the approach used in language models for modeling sequences ofwords. The design of the Future Predictor Model is same as that of theAutoencoder Model, except that the decoder LSTM in this case predicts frames ofthe video that come after the input sequence (Fig. 3).Ranzato et al. (2014) use a similar model but predict only the next frame at eachtime step. This model, on the other hand, predicts a long sequence into thefuture. Here again we can consider two variants of the decoder – conditionaland unconditioned. For each of these two models, we can consider two possibilities - one in whichthe decoder LSTM is conditioned on the last generated frame and the other inwhich it is not. In the experimental section, we explore these choicesquantitatively. Here we briefly discuss arguments for and against a conditionaldecoder. A strong argument in favour of using a conditional decoder is that itallows the decoder to model multiple modes in the target sequence distribution.Without that, we would end up averaging the multiple modes in the low-levelinput space. However, this is an issue only if we expect multiple modes in thetarget sequence distribution. For the LSTM Autoencoder, there is only onecorrect target and hence a unimodal target distribution. But for the LSTM FuturePredictor there is a possibility of multiple targets given an input because evenif we assume a deterministic universe, everything needed to predict the futurewill not necessarily be observed in the input. Future prediction results are summarized in Table 2. For MNIST we compute the cross entropy of the predictions with respect to the ground truth, both of which are 64 × 64 patches. For natural image patches, we compute the squared loss. We see that the Composite Model always does a better job of predicting the future compared to the Future Predictor. This indicates that having the autoencoder along with the future predictor to force the model to remember more about the inputs actually helps predict the future better. Next, we can compare each model with its conditional variant. Here, we find that the conditional models perform better, as was also noted in Fig. 5."
List down supervised and unsupervised tasks on which the proposed model is tested?,"Supervised tasks: action recognition
Unsupervised tasks: representation learning","The supervised task is action recognition and unsupervised tasks are representation reconstruction, which can be inferred from P4.","In order to evaluate the learned representations we qualitatively analyze thereconstructions and predictions made by the model. For a more quantitativeevaluation, we use these LSTMs as initializations for the supervised task ofaction recognition. If the unsupervised learning model comes up with usefulrepresentations then the classifier should be able to perform better, especiallywhen there are only a few labelled examples. We find that this is indeed thecase."
"Historically, which architectures have been used for supervised sequence learning tasks?",Recurrent neural networks using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture,Recurrent neural networks using the Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) architectures have been used for supervised sequence learning tasks.,"Understanding temporal sequences is important for solving many problems in theAI-set. Recently, recurrent neural networks using the Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) architecture (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) have been used successfully to perform various supervisedsequence learning tasks, such as speech recognition (Graves & Jaitly, 2014), machinetranslation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014), and caption generation for images(Vinyals et al., 2014). They have also been applied on videos for recognizingactions and generating natural language descriptions (Donahue et al., 2014). Ageneral sequence to sequence learning framework was described by Sutskever et al. (2014)in which a recurrent network is used to encode a sequence into a fixed lengthrepresentation, and then another recurrent network is used to decode a sequenceout of that representation. In this work, we apply and extend this framework tolearn representations of sequences of images. We choose to work in theunsupervised setting where we only have access to a dataset of unlabelledvideos."
How good the LSTM based encode/decoder work for real time applications keeping in view their sequential nature?,LSTM-based encode/decoders are well-suited for real-time applications due to their ability to process sequential data efficiently,"Since LSTM based encoder/decoder method successfully worked for real time sequential nature application, it is a good method.","Understanding temporal sequences is important for solving many problems in theAI-set.

The authors extended which baseline framework to learn representation of image sequences?,"Sure! Here's the answer:

The authors extended the randomly initialized LSTM classifier baseline framework to learn representation of image sequences",The authors extended identical LSTM classifier framework as baseline to learn representation of image sequences.,"The baseline for comparing these models is an identical LSTM classifier but with randomly initialized weights. All classifiers used dropout regularization, where we dropped activations as they were communicated across layers but not through time within the same LSTM as proposed in Zaremba et al. (2014). We emphasize that this is a very strong baseline and does significantly better than just using single frames. Using dropout was crucial in order to train good baseline models especially with very few training examples."
Why the authors prefer to learn video representations through unsupervised models?,"To avoid the challenges of collecting large amounts of labeled data and doing feature engineering to keep the dimensionality low, and to leverage the inherent structure in videos to learn representations",Labelling videos is a tedious job and that makes supervise training very expensive. Compare to that unsupervised model can take advantage of all videos available that doesn't need labelling. That's why the authors prefer to learn video representations through unsupervised models.,"Supervised learning has been extremely successful in learning good visualrepresentations that not only produce good results at the task they are trainedfor, but also transfer well to other tasks and datasets. Therefore, it isnatural to extend the same approach to learning video representations. This hasled to research in 3D convolutional nets (Ji et al., 2013; Tran et al., 2014), different temporalfusion strategies (Karpathy et al., 2014) and exploring different ways ofpresenting visual information to convolutional nets (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014a).However, videos are much higher dimensional entities compared to single images.Therefore, it becomes increasingly difficult to do credit assignment and learn longrange structure, unless we collect much more labelled data or do a lot offeature engineering (for example computing the right kinds of flow features) tokeep the dimensionality low. The costly work of collecting more labelled dataand the tedious work of doing more clever engineering can go a long way insolving particular problems, but this is ultimately unsatisfying as a machinelearning solution. This highlights the need for using unsupervised learning tofind and represent structure in videos. Moreover, videos have a lot ofstructure in them (spatial and temporal regularities) which makes themparticularly well suited as a domain for building unsupervised learning models."
How a target sequence is produced from a input frame sequence using LSTM?,"The target sequence is produced by the decoder LSTM taking over after the last input has been read by the encoder LSTM, and outputting a prediction for the target sequence, which is the same as the input sequence but in reverse order","From P0 and P1, It is directly answered that, through encoder-decoder the target sequence is produced.","In this section, we describe a model that uses Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) madeof LSTM units to do unsupervised learning. The model consists of two RNNs –the encoder LSTM and the decoder LSTM as shown in Fig. 2. Theinput to the model is a sequence of vectors (image patches or features). Theencoder LSTM reads in this sequence. After the last input has been read, thedecoder LSTM takes over and outputs a prediction for the target sequence. Thetarget sequence is same as the input sequence, but in reverse order. Reversingthe target sequence makes the optimization easier because the model can get offthe ground by looking at low range correlations. This is also inspired by howlists are represented in LISP. The encoder can be seen as creating a list byapplying the cons function on the previously constructed list and the newinput. The decoder essentially unrolls this list, with the hidden to outputweights extracting the element at the top of the list (car function) andthe hidden to hidden weights extracting the rest of the list (cdrfunction). Therefore, the first element out is the last element in. When designing any unsupervised learning model, it is crucial to have the rightinductive biases and choose the right objective function so that the learningsignal points the model towards learning useful features. Inthis paper, we use the LSTM Encoder-Decoder framework to learn videorepresentations. The key inductive bias here is that the same operation must beapplied at each time step to propagate information to the next step. Thisenforces the fact that the physics of the world remains the same, irrespective ofinput. The same physics acting on any state, at any time, must produce the nextstate. Our model works as follows.The Encoder LSTM runs through a sequence of frames to come upwith a representation. This representation is then decoded through another LSTMto produce a target sequence. We consider different choices of the targetsequence. One choice is to predict the same sequence as the input. Themotivation is similar to that of autoencoders – we wish to capture all that isneeded to reproduce the input but at the same time go through the inductivebiases imposed by the model. Another option is to predict the future frames.Here the motivation is to learn a representation that extracts all that isneeded to extrapolate the motion and appearance beyond what has been observed. These twonatural choices can also be combined. In this case, there are two decoder LSTMs– one that decodes the representation into the input sequence and another thatdecodes the same representation to predict the future."
What are the different input types used for the proposed model?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Two types of inputs are used for the proposed model:

1. Image patches (natural and moving MNIST digits)
2. High-level percepts extracted from a convolutional neural net model trained on ImageNet",Image patches and high-level percepts are the two types of inputs used in the proposed model.,"The inputs to the model can, in principle, be any representation of individualvideo frames. However, for the purposes of this work, we limit our attention totwo kinds of inputs. The first is image patches. For this we use natural imagepatches as well as a dataset of moving MNIST digits. The second ishigh-level “percepts” extracted by applying a convolutional net trained onImageNet. These percepts are the states of last (and/or second-to-last) layers ofrectified linear hidden states from a convolutional neural net model."
Why should LSTM based auto-encoder models learn good features?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

LSTM based auto-encoder models should learn good features because they are designed to retain information about the appearance of objects and the background, as well as the motion contained in the video, while preventing the model from learning an identity mapping and effectively copying the input to the output","Since LSTM based auto-encoder models control the learning an identity mapping, it forced learn good features.","Why should this learn good features?The state of the encoder LSTM after the last input has been read is therepresentation of the input video. The decoder LSTM is being asked toreconstruct back the input sequence from this representation. In order to do so,the representation must retain information about the appearance of the objectsand the background as well as the motion contained in the video.However, an important question for any autoencoder-style model is what preventsit from learning an identity mapping and effectively copying the input to theoutput. In that case all the information about the input would still be presentbut the representation will be no better than the input. There are two factorsthat control this behaviour. First, the fact that there are only a fixed numberof hidden units makes it unlikely that the model can learn trivial mappings forarbitrary length input sequences.

Why the conditional decoder is difficult to optimize?,"The conditional decoder is difficult to optimize because it relies heavily on short-range correlations in the input data, which can result in a limited gradient signal and make it challenging for the model to learn long-term dependencies","Since in conditional decoder have access to last few frames, often it find a easy way to pick up a correlated frame but not necessary an optimized one. That is why it is difficult to optimize.","There is also an argument against using a conditional decoder from theoptimization point-of-view. There are strong short-range correlations invideo data, for example, most of the content of a frame is same as the previousone. If the decoder was given access to the last few frames while generating aparticular frame at training time, it would find it easy to pick up on thesecorrelations. There would only be a very small gradient that tries to fix up theextremely subtle errors that require long term knowledge about the inputsequence. In an unconditioned decoder, this input is removed and the model isforced to look for information deep inside the encoder."

The features learned by unsupervised learning improved the performance of supervised learning tasks, as evident from the improvement in action recognition achieved by finetuning different unsupervised learning models","The improvement in classification by using unsupervised learning was not as big as we expected, we still managed to yield an additional improvement over a strong baseline. If the unsupervised learning model comes up with useful representations then the classifier perform better, especially when there are only a few labelled examples. Based on the above evidence, it can be safely said that features learned by unsupervised learning improved the performance of supervised learning tasks.","Fig. 12 compares three models - single frame classifier(logistic regression), baseline LSTM classifier and the LSTM classifierinitialized with weights from the Composite Model as the number of labelledvideos per class is varied. Note that having one labelled video means havingmany labelled 16 frame blocks. We can see that for the case of very fewtraining examples, unsupervised learning gives a substantial improvement. Forexample, for UCF-101, the performance improves from 29.6% to 34.3% whentraining on only one labelled video. As the size of the labelled dataset grows,the improvement becomes smaller. Even for the full UCF-101 dataset we still get aconsiderable improvement from 74.5% to 75.8%. On HMDB-51, the improvement isfrom 42.8% to 44.0% for the full dataset (70 videos per class) and 14.4% to19.1% for one video per class. Although, the improvement in classification byusing unsupervised learning was not as big as we expected, we still managed toyield an additional improvement over a strong baseline. We discuss some avenuesfor improvements later. Next, we compare the models using performance on a supervised task.Table 3 shows the performance on actionrecognition achieved by finetuning different unsupervised learning models.Besides running the experiments on the full UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, we also ran theexperiments on small subsets of these to better highlight the case where we havevery few training examples. We find that all unsupervised models improve over thebaseline LSTM which is itself well-regularized by using dropout. The Autoencodermodel seems to perform consistently better than the Future Predictor. TheComposite model which combines the two does better than either one alone.Conditioning on the generated inputs does not seem to give a clearadvantage over not doing so. The Composite Model with a conditional futurepredictor works the best, although its performance is almost same as that of theComposite Model. We proposed models based on LSTMs that can learn good video representations. Wecompared them and analyzed their properties through visualizations. Moreover, wemanaged to get an improvement on supervised tasks. The best performing model wasthe Composite Model that combined an autoencoder and a future predictor.Conditioning on generated outputs did not have a significant impact on theperformance for supervised tasks, however it made the future predictions lookslightly better. The model was able to persistently generate motion well beyondthe time scales it was trained for. However, it lost the precise object featuresrapidly after the training time scale. The features at the input and outputlayers were found to have some interesting properties. In order to evaluate the learned representations we qualitatively analyze thereconstructions and predictions made by the model. For a more quantitativeevaluation, we use these LSTMs as initializations for the supervised task ofaction recognition. If the unsupervised learning model comes up with usefulrepresentations then the classifier should be able to perform better, especiallywhen there are only a few labelled examples. We find that this is indeed thecase."
What is the impact of number of training videos on the performance of supervised and unsupervised tasks?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the given context:

The number of training videos has a significant impact on the performance of both supervised and unsupervised tasks. As the number of training videos increases, the performance of both tasks improves, but the improvement is more substantial for unsupervised tasks when the number of training examples is very few",As the number of training videos increases the performance of supervised and unsupervised tasks increases.,"Fig. 12 compares three models - single frame classifier(logistic regression), baseline LSTM classifier and the LSTM classifierinitialized with weights from the Composite Model as the number of labelledvideos per class is varied.

Which evaluation criteria was used to compare the performance of action recognition models?,"Performance was evaluated using Table 4, which compares the models based on three sets: RGB data, explicitly computed flow features, and both",Evaluation criteria are measure on RGB data(single or multiple frames) and flow features.,"Finally, we compare our models to the state-of-the-art action recognitionresults. The performance is summarized in Table 4. The table isdivided into three sets. The first set compares models that use only RGB data(single or multiple frames). The second set compares models that use explicitlycomputed flow features only. Models in the third set use both."
Which metric is used to compare different unsupervised models?,Predictive error,Error in predicting the future and the performance on supervised tasks are the metrics  used to compare different unsupervised models.,"The aim of this set of experiments is to compare the different variants of themodel proposed in this paper. Since it is always possible to get lowerreconstruction error by copying the inputs, we cannot use input reconstructionerror as a measure of how good a model is doing. However, we can use the errorin predicting the future as a reasonable measure of how good the model isdoing. Besides, we can use the performance on supervised tasks as a proxy forhow good the unsupervised model is doing. In this section, we present results fromthese two analyses."
Why is it a good idea to apply the convolutions across patches of the video instead of whole frames?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Applying convolutions across patches of the video instead of whole frames helps extract motion information that would otherwise be lost across max-pooling layers",To extract motion information it is a good idea to apply the convolutions across patches of the video instead of whole frames.,"To further get improvements for supervised tasks, we believe that the model canbe extended by applying it convolutionally across patches of the video andstacking multiple layers of such models. Applying this model in the lower layersof a convolutional net could help extract motion information that wouldotherwise be lost across max-pooling layers. In our future work, we plan tobuild models based on these autoencoders from the bottom up instead of applyingthem only to percepts."
What is kernel size used in each layer of SegNet?,7x7,The kernel size used in each layer of SegNet is 7*7.,"We draw inspiration of our encoder-decoder type architectures from probabilistic auto-encoders used to build generative models [24] and unsupervised learning of feature hierarchies [27]. Our main contribution is to learn an encoder-decoder stack trained in a modular and fully supervised manner for pixel-wise labelling. The addition of each deeper encoder-decoder pair results in an increased spatial context i.e., a 4 layer SegNet with 7\times 7 kernels and 2\times 2 non-overlapping max pooling in each layer has a spatial context of 106\times 106 pixels when a feature-map is backtracked to the input image. The SegNet predictions get smoother as more layers are added and demonstrate high accuracy, comparable to or even exceeding methods which use CRFs [36]. SegNet maintains a constant number of features per layer which is typically set to 64. This has a practical advantage that the computational cost successively decreases for each additional/deeper encoder-decoder pair. SegNet uses a “flat” architecture, i.e, the number of features in each layer remains the same (64 in our case) but with full connectivity. This choice is motivated by two reasons. First, it avoids parameter explosion, unlike an expanding deep encoder network with full feature connectivity (same for decoder). Second, the training time remains the same (in our experiments it slightly decreases) for each additional/deeper encoder-decoder pair as the feature map resolution is smaller which makes convolutions faster. Note that the decoder corresponding to the first encoder (closest to the input image) produces a multi-channel feature map although the encoder input is either 3 or 4 channels (RGB or RGBD) (see Fig. 1). This high dimensional feature representation is fed to the soft-max classifier. This is unlike the other decoders which produce feature maps the same size as their encoder inputs. A fixed pooling window of 2\times 2 with a stride of non-overlapping 2 pixels is used. This small size preserves thin structures in the scene. Further, a constant kernel size of 7\times 7 over all the layers was chosen to provide a wide context for smooth labelling i.e. a pixel in the deepest layer feature map can be traced back to a context window in the input image of 106\times 106 pixels. The trade-off here is between the size of the context window and retaining thin structures. Smaller kernels decrease context and larger ones potentially destroy thin structures."
How the features are converted to pixel labels in SegNet?,Deep layers of feature encoding with a large spatial context are used to convert features to pixel labels in SegNet,SegNet performs feed-forward computation to obtain pixel-wise labelling.,"We presented SegNet, a fully trainable deep architecture for joint feature learning and mapping an input image in a feed-forward manner to its pixel-wise semantic labels. A highlight of the proposed architecture is its ability to produce smooth segment labels when compared with local patch based classifiers. This is due to deep layers of feature encoding that employ a large spatial context for pixel-wise labelling. To the best of our knowledge this is the first deep learning method to learn to map low resolution encoder feature maps to semantic labels. Both qualitative and numerical accuracy of the SegNet for outdoor and indoor scenes is very competitive, even without use of any CRF post-processing. We have also demonstrated the use of pre-trained SegNet for obtaining good performance on other datasets with a small extra computational effort. The encoder-decoder architecture of the SegNet can also be trained unsupervised and to handle missing data in the input during test time."
What is the advantage of stacking encoders and decoders for semantic segmentation?,"Stacking encoders and decoders for semantic segmentation provides several advantages, including:

1. Increased spatial context for pixel labeling, resulting in smoother predictions.
2. The ability to introduce deeper layers with pooling-subsampling, which improves the spatial context for pixel labeling.
3. The ability to perform ablation studies to understand the effects of features.
4. The ability to produce smooth segment labels compared to local patch-based classifiers.
5. The ability to learn to map low-resolution encoder feature maps to semantic labels",Stacking encoders and decoders architecture produce smooth segment labels.,"Semantic segmentation is an important step towards understanding and inferring different objects and their arrangements observed in a scene. This has wide array of applications ranging from estimating scene geometry, inferring support-relationships among objects to autonomous vehicle driving. Early methods that relied on low-level vision cues have fast been superseded by popular machine learning algorithms. In particular, deep learning has seen huge success lately in handwritten digit recognition, speech, categorising whole images and detecting objects in images [37, 34] also seen growing interest in semantic pixel-wise labelling problems [7, 14, 35]. However, these recent approaches have tried to directly adopt deep architectures designed for category prediction to pixel-wise labelling. The results, although very encouraging, have not been quite satisfactory. Primarily, the deepest layer representations/feature maps are of a small resolution as compared to input image dimensions due to several pooling layers e.g. if 2\times 2 non-overlapping max-pooling-subsampling layers are used three times, the resulting feature map is 1/8^{th} of the input dimension. Therefore, an ad hoc technique is used to upsample the deepest layer feature map to match the input image dimensions by replicating features within a block i.e. all pixels within a block (8\times 8 in our example) have the same features. This often results in predictions that appear blocky222see http://david.grangier.info/scene_parsing/. This is exactly what we improve using our proposed SegNet architecture, wherein the decoders learn to map the deepest layer features to full image dimensions. Learning to decode has two other advantages.First, deeper layers each with pooling-subsampling can be introduced which increases the spatial context for pixel labelling.

Can we use image classification models for semantic segmentation?,"No. While image classification models can achieve high accuracy on certain tasks, they are not well-suited for semantic segmentation due to the following reasons:

1. Lack of spatial information: Image classification models are designed to classify images as a whole, rather than providing pixel-level information.
2. Limited context: These models do not take into account the context of neighboring pixels, which is crucial for accurate semantic segmentation.
3. Inability to handle imbalanced datasets: Many image classification models struggle with imbalanced datasets, which can lead to poor performance on certain classes.

Therefore, hand-engineered features and post-processing techniques such as CRFs are still the preferred approach for semantic segmentation tasks","Since a patch is fed into a classifier to predict the class probabilities of the center pixel, it is evident that image classification models for semantic segmentation.","Semantic pixel-wise segmentation is an ongoing topic of research, fuelled by challenging datasets [1, 33, 9]. Current best performing methods all mostly rely on hand engineered features generally used for per-pixel independent classification. Typically, a patch is fed into a classifier e.g. Random Forest [32, 2] or Boosting [36, 20] to predict the class probabilities of the center pixel. Features based on appearance [32], SfM and appearance [2, 36, 20] have been explored for the CamVid test. These per-pixel noisy predictions (often called unary terms) from the classifiers are then smoothed by using a pair-wise or higher order CRF [36, 20] to improve the accuracy. More recent approaches have aimed to produce high quality unaries by trying to predict the labels for all the pixels in a patch as opposed to only the center pixel. This improves the results of Random Forest based unaries [18] but thin structured classes are classfied poorly. Dense depth maps computed from the CamVid video have also been used as input for classification using Random Forests [43]. Another approach argues for the use of a combination of popular hand designed features and spatio temporal super-pixelization to obtain higher accuracy [39]. Recent top performing technique on the CamVid test [20] addresses the imbalance among label frequencies by using additional training data from the PASCAL VOC dataset to learn object detectors. The result of all these techniques indicates the need for improved classification as increases in accuracy have mostly come from adding new features or modalities to the classifier. Post-processing using CRF models of various orders [36] has mainly resulted in improving the accuracy of dominant classes such as sky, road, buildings with little effect on the accuracy of thin structured but equally important classes such as signs, poles, pedestrians. This highlights the need for better pixel-wise classification when imbalanced label frequencies exist.Meanwhile, indoor RGBD pixel-wise semantic segmentation has also gained popularity since the release of the NYU dataset [33] which showed the usefulness of the depth channel to improve segmentation. Their approach used features such as RGB-SIFT, depth-SIFT, location as input to a neural network classifier to predict pixel unaries. The noisy unaries are then smoothed using a CRF. Improvements were made using a richer feature set including LBP and region segmentation to obtain higher accuracy [28] followed by a CRF. In more recent work [33], both class segmentation and support relationships are inferred together using a combination of RGB and depth based cues. Another approach focusses on real-time joint reconstruction and semantic segmentation, where Random Forests are used as the classifier [13]. Gupta et al. [12] use boundary detection and hierarchical grouping before performing category segmentation. The common attribute along all these approaches is the use of hand engineered features for pixel-wise classifiction of either RGB or RGBD images. The application of deep learning for scene segmentation has only just begun. There have also been a few attempts to apply networks designed for categorization to segmentation, particularly by replicating the deepest layer features in blocks to match image dimensions [7, 6, 11, 8]. However, the resulting classification is blocky [11]. Another approach using recurrent neural networks [26] merges several low resolution predictions to create input image resolution predictions. On the whole, although some of these techniques already present improvements over hand engineered features [7]."
SegNet architecture is inspired from which domain?,Probabilistic auto-encoders and unsupervised learning of feature hierarchies,SegNet architecture is inspired from generative models and unsupervised learning.,"We draw inspiration of our encoder-decoder type architectures from probabilistic auto-encoders used to build generative models [24] and unsupervised learning of feature hierarchies [27].

SegNet maintains a constant number of features per layer which is typically set to 64. This has a practical advantage that the computational cost successively decreases for each additional/deeper encoder-decoder pair. Our work is inspired by the unsupervised feature learning architecture proposed by Ranzato et. al [27]. The key learning module is an encoder-decoder network where the encoder consists of a filter bank convolution, tanh squashing function, max pooling followed by sub-sampling to obtain the feature maps. For each sample, the indices of the max locations computed during pooling are stored and passed to the decoder. The decoder upsamples the feature maps by using the already stored pooled indices, also called switches, and learns a decoder filter bank to reconstruct the input image. This architecture was used for unsupervised pre-training of feature hierarchies. A similar decoding technique is used for visualizing trained convolutional networks[42] for object classification; the transposed encoder kernels are set as the decoder kernels which are followed by a non-linearity and the pooling indices are used for upsampling. The architecture of Ranzato mainly concentrated on layer wise feature learning using small input patches although during test time a full sized image was the input. This discrepancy was corrected for by Kavukcuoglu et. al. [16] by using test size images/feature maps to learn hierarchical encoders. Both these approaches however did not attempt to use deep encoder-decoder networks for unsupervised feature training as they discarded the decoders after each encoder training. Here, the SegNet architecture differs from these approaches as the objective used for training all the encoder-decoder pairs is the same, i.e., to minimise the cross-entropy label loss."
What are the total number of encoders and decoders used in SegNet?,4 encoders and 4 decoders,4 encoders and 4 decoders are used in SegNet.,"We draw inspiration of our encoder-decoder type architectures from probabilistic auto-encoders used to build generative models [24] and unsupervised learning of feature hierarchies [27].

SegNet maintains a constant number of features per layer which is typically set to 64. This has a practical advantage that the computational cost successively decreases for each additional/deeper encoder-decoder pair. We use mini-batches that maximize GPU usage and avoid GPU-CPU memory transfers. Typically, 25-50 randomly chosen images (with replacement) per mini-batch. The optimizer is run for 20 iterations per mini-batch and 10 epochs for each layer. We empirically observe that the objective plateaus after 5-6 epochs and so we run another 4 epochs as a margin. Note that, after 10 epochs, each input sample approximately “influences” the optimizer200 times. We train the encoder-decoder pair weights closest to the input layer. The soft-max layer can be trained first or randomly initialised. It then remains fixed throughout the experiment. Next, we introduce a deeper layer of encoder-decoder (see Fig. 2) and train their weights while holding the shallower layer encoder-decoder weights fixed. Note that the objective remains the same, i.e., to minimize label cross-entropy loss over the mini-batch. This is unlike unsupervised feature learning approaches which reconstruct the input of the layer in question [27, 16], thus varying the objective with each layer. The deconvolution network [42] on the other hand optimizes the same reconstruction objective with each deeper layer. The difference to our approach is (i) the objective is unsupervised, (ii) there is no encoder to learn a feed-forward representation thus requiring an optimisation step during test time to produce features for recognition. We successively add deeper encoder-decoder pairs and train them while holding the preceeding pair’s weights fixed. In total, we use 4 layer networks, i.e., 4 encoders and 4 decoders in our experiments. Once the encoder-decoder stack is trained, we find that there is no advantage to training the soft-max layer as it only relies on a linear discriminant function.We wrote our own Matlab GPU compatible implementation of SegNet that uses the minFunc optimization library [31]. Our code has been tested on NVIDIA Tesla K40, GTX GeForce 880M and GTXGeForce780 GPUs. We will make our light-weight Matlab code available publicly soon. With the current state of code optimisation, training a 4 layer deep SegNet on the CamVid dataset (367 training images of 360\times 480) takes about a week. The unoptimized test time is in the order of 2secs/frame: bulk of the computation time is spent performing tensor convolutions in the feedforward path and FFT based convolutions during backpropagation 333more speedup can be gained https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN."

Define local contrast normalization (LCN)?,"Local Contrast Normalization (LCN) is a pre-processing technique used in computer vision tasks, particularly in semantic segmentation, that normalizes the contrast of an image or feature map locally to improve the performance of the model","Local Contrast Normalization (LCN) is a pre-processing step that normalize the input to a non-uniform scene illumination, highlight edges, and decorrelates the input dimensions. This normalization performed on each channel of an input image. It improves convergence and helps to learn category shape.","The input to the SegNet can be any arbitrary multi-channel image or feature map(s), e.g., RGB, RGBD, map of normals, depth etc. We perform local contrast normalization (LCN) as a pre-processing step to the input [23, 15]. The advantage of this step are many, (i) to correct for non-uniform scene illumination thus reducing the dynamic range (increases contrast in shadowed parts). (ii) highlighting edges which leads the network to learn category shape, (iii) improves convergence as it decorrelates the input dimensions [23]. LCN is performed independently for each modality, i.e., RGB is contrast normalized as a three channel input and depth as a single channel for RGBD inputs. This avoids highlighting pseudo depth edges due to RGB edges and vice-versa."

How long is this challenge been running?,5 years,The challenge has been running for past 5 years.,"The key lesson of collecting the datasets and running the challenges for five years is this: All human intelligence tasks need to be exceptionally well-designed. We learned this lesson both when annotating the dataset using Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (Section 3) and evenwhen trying to evaluate human-level image classification accuracy using expert labelers (Section 6.4). The first iteration of the labeling interface was always bad – generally meaning completely unusable. If there was any inherent ambiguity in the questions posed (and there almost always was), workers found it and accuracy suffered. If there is one piece of advice we can offer to future research, it is to very carefully design, continuously monitor, and extensively sanity-check all crowdsourcing tasks. In this section we describe the standardized evaluation criteria for each of the three ILSVRC tasks. We elaborate further on these and other more minor challenges with large-scale evaluation.

ImageNet challenge benchmarks which problems in computer vision domain?,"ImageNet challenge benchmarks various problems in the computer vision domain, including object recognition, scene understanding, and 3D reconstruction",It emphasizes the importance of examining the bias inherent in any standardized dataset.,"There are several datasets with standardized online evaluationsimilar to ILSVRC: the aforementioned PASCAL VOC (Everingham et al.,, 2012), Labeled Faces in the Wild (Huang et al.,, 2007) for unconstrained face recognition,Reconstruction meets Recognition (Urtasun et al.,, 2014) for 3D reconstruction and KITTI (Geiger et al.,, 2013) for computer vision in autonomous driving. These datasets along with ILSVRC help benchmark progress in different areas of computer vision.Works such as (Torralba and Efros,, 2011) emphasize the importance of examining the bias inherent in any standardized dataset."
What is the difference between classification and object detection?,"In the context of computer vision tasks, object detection involves locating and bounding boxes around instances of objects in an image, while image classification involves assigning a class label to the entire image","For the image classification task every image was annotated with one object class label, corresponding toone object that is present in an image. For the single-object localization task, every validation and test image and a subset of the training images were annotated  with axis-aligned bounding boxes around every instance of this object.","Recall that for the image classification task every image was annotated with one object class label, corresponding toone object that is present in an image. For the single-object localization task, every validation and test image and a subset of the training imagesare annotated with axis-aligned bounding boxes around every instance of this object."
How many images do the ILSVRC dataset has?,"1.2 million training images, 50 thousand validation images, and 100 thousand test images","ILSVRC dataset has 1.2 million training images, 50 thousand validation images and 100 thousand test images.","Using the image collection and annotation procedure described in previous sections, we collected a large-scale datasetused for ILSVRC classification task. There are 1000 object classes and approximately 1.2 million training images, 50 thousand validation images and 100 thousand test images. Table 2 (top) documents the size of the dataset over the years of the challenge."
Objects are divided into how many classes in the ILSVRC dtaset?,494 object classes,It's divided into 1000 classes.,"Using the image collection and annotation procedure described in previous sections, we collected a large-scale datasetused for ILSVRC classification task. There are 1000 object classes and approximately 1.2 million training images, 50 thousand validation images and 100 thousand test images. Table 2 (top) documents the size of the dataset over the years of the challenge. The selection of the 200 object detection classes in 2013 was guided by the ILSVRC 2012 classification and localization dataset.Starting with 1000 object classes and their bounding box annotations wefirst eliminated all object classes which tended to be too “big” in the image (on average the object area was greater than 50\% of theimage area). These were classes such as T-shirt, spiderweb, or manhole cover. We then manually eliminated all classeswhich we did not feel were well-suited for detection, such as hay, barbershop, or poncho. This left 494 object classeswhich were merged into basic-level categories: for example, different species of birds were merged into just the “bird” class.The classes remained the same in ILSVRC2014.Appendix D contains the complete list of object categories used in ILSVRC2013-2014 (in the context of the hierarchy described in Section 3.3.3). The scale of ILSVRC classification task (1000 categories and more than a million of images) makes it very expensive to label every instance of every object in every image. Therefore, on this dataset only one object category is labeled in each image. This creates ambiguity in evaluation. For example, an image might be labeled as a “strawberry” but contain both a strawberry and an apple. Then an algorithm would not know which one of the two objects to name. For the image classification task we allowed an algorithm to identify multiple (up to 5) objects in an image and not be penalized as long as one of the objects indeed corresponded to the ground truth label. Figure 7(top row) shows some examples."
What added benefits do the ILSVRC provide over the existing PASCAL-VOC challenge?,"ILSVRC provides several added benefits over PASCAL-VOC, including:

* 10 times more object classes
* 10.6 times more fully annotated training images
* 35.2 times more training objects
* 3.5 times more validation images
* 3.5 times more validation objects
* A wider variety of objects, including tiny objects like sunglasses and ping-pong balls",Images from the ILSVRC2012 single-object localization validation set are compared to images from the PASCAL VOC benchmark for object recognition. They have also analyzed the level of difficulty of object localization in these images compared to those of objects from the PASCAL VOC benchmark. The level of difficulty of object localization is also analyzed.,"The ILSVRC dataset and the competition has allowed significant algorithmic advances in large-scale image recognition and retrieval. The closest to ILSVRC is the PASCAL VOC dataset (Everingham et al.,, 2010, 2014), which provides a standardized test bed for object detection, image classification, object segmentation, person layout, and action classification. Much of the design choices in ILSVRC have been inspired by PASCAL VOC and the similarities and differences between the datasets are discussed at length throughout the paper.ILSVRC scales up PASCAL VOC’s goal of standardized training and evaluation of recognition algorithms by more than an order of magnitude in numberof object classes and images: PASCAL VOC 2012 has 20 object classes and 21,738 images compared to ILSVRC2012 with 1000 object classes and 1,431,167 annotated images. In addition to the size of the dataset, we also analyze the level of difficulty of object localizationin these images compared to the PASCAL VOC benchmark. We compute statistics on the ILSVRC2012 single-object localizationvalidation set images compared to PASCAL VOC 2012 validation images. Prior to ILSVRC, the object detection benchmark was the PASCAL VOC challenge (Everingham et al.,, 2010).ILSVRC has 10 times more object classes than PASCAL VOC (200 vs 20), 10.6 times more fully annotated training images (60,658 vs 5,717), 35.2 times more training objects (478,807 vs 13,609),3.5 times more validation images (20,121 vs 5823) and 3.5 times more validation objects (55,501 vs15,787). ILSVRC has 2.8 annotated objects per image on the validation set, compared to 2.7 in PASCAL VOC. The average object in ILSVRC takes up 17.0\% of the image area and in PASCAL VOC takes up 20.7\%; Table 3 contains per-class comparisons. Additionally, ILSVRC contains a wide variety of objects, including tiny objects such as sunglasses (1.3\% of image area on average), ping-pong balls (1.5\% of image area on average) and basketballs (2.0\% of image area on average)."
Is taking a closer look at the current state of the field of categorical object recognition the only goal behind this challenge?,No. The paper also discusses the challenges of creating the large-scale object recognition benchmark dataset and highlights developments in object classification and detection that have resulted from this effort,"This paper has three primary goals: 1.To address the difficulty of producing this large-scale object identification benchmark dataset, 2.To highlightthe improvements in object categorization and detection that have emerged from this work, and3.To take a deeper look at the present status of the fieldof categorical object identification.","This paper has three key goals:1.To discuss the challenges of creating this large-scale object recognition benchmark dataset,2.To highlightthe developments in object classification and detection that have resulted from this effort, and3.To take a closer look at the current state of the fieldof categorical object recognition.The paper may be of interest to researchers working on creating large-scale datasets, as well as to anybody interested in better understanding the history and the current state of large-scale object recognition."
"Fast YOLO processes double the mAP of other real-time detectors, what is the actual value of the mAP ?",52.7%,"The baseline YOLO model shows 63.4% mAP at 45fps on the Pascal VOC dataset, while Fast YOLO is on 52.7 mAP at 150fps. Still, they are more than twice more accurate compared to other real-time detectors. However, the YOLO network was observed to struggle with small objects but is generalizable well to other domains.","First, YOLO is extremely fast. Since we frame detection as a regression problem we don’t need a complex pipeline. We simply run our neural network on a new image at test time to predict detections. Our base network runs at 45 frames per second with no batch processing on a Titan X GPU and a fast version runs at more than 150 fps. This means we can process streaming video in real-time with less than 25 milliseconds of latency. Furthermore, YOLO achieves more than twice the mean average precision of other real-time systems. For a demo of our system running in real-time on a webcam please see our project webpage: http://pjreddie.com/yolo/. Fast YOLO is the fastest object detection method on Pascal; as far as we know, it is the fastest extant object detector. With 52.7\% mAP, it is more than twice as accurate as prior work on real-time detection. YOLO pushes mAP to 63.4\% while still maintaining real-time performance. On the VOC 2012 test set, YOLO scores 57.9% mAP. This is lower than the current state of the art, closer to the original R-CNN using VGG-16, see Table 3. Our system struggles with small objects compared to its closest competitors. On categories like bottle, sheep, and tv/monitor YOLO scores 8-10% lower than R-CNN or Feature Edit. However, on other categories like cat and train YOLO achieves higher performance. Fast YOLO is the fastest general-purpose object detector in the literature and YOLO pushes the state-of-the-art in real-time object detection. YOLO also generalizes well to new domains making it ideal for applications that rely on fast, robust object detection."
What are the metrics used to compare the performance between YOLO & DPM/RCNN?,mAP (mean Average Precision) is used to compare the performance between YOLO and DPM/R-CNN,"Different approaches to evaluating object detection models are presented in the paper where they mostly use mean average precision (mAP) and frames per second (fps) for accuracy and speed respectively. Qualitatively, the YOLO's errors are compared to R-CNN, and mAP on different classes of objects is shown. Moreover, YOLO was shown to boost the performance of R-CNN, and better generalize for new domains.","First we compare YOLO with other real-time detection systems on Pascal VOC 2007. To understand the differences between YOLO and R-CNN variants we explore the errors on VOC 2007 made by YOLO and Fast R-CNN, one of the highest performing versions of R-CNN [14]. Based on the different error profiles we show that YOLO can be used to rescore Fast R-CNN detections and reduce the errors from background false positives, giving a significant performance boost. We also present VOC 2012 results and compare mAP to current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show that YOLO generalizes to new domains better than other detectors on two artwork datasets. Many research efforts in object detection focus on making standard detection pipelines fast. [5] [38] [31] [14] [17] [28] However, only Sadeghi et al. actually produce a detection system that runs in real-time (30 frames per second or better) [31]. We compare YOLO to their GPU implementation of DPM which runs either at 30Hz or 100Hz. While the other efforts don’t reach the real-time milestone we also compare their relative mAP and speed to examine the accuracy-performance tradeoffs available in object detection systems. On the VOC 2012 test set, YOLO scores 57.9% mAP. This is lower than the current state of the art, closer to the original R-CNN using VGG-16, see Table 3. Our system struggles with small objects compared to its closest competitors. On categories like bottle, sheep, and tv/monitor YOLO scores 8-10% lower than R-CNN or Feature Edit. However, on other categories like cat and train YOLO achieves higher performance. YOLO has good performance on VOC 2007 and its AP degrades less than other methods when applied to artwork. Like DPM, YOLO models the size and shapeof objects, as well as relationships between objects and where objects commonly appear. Artwork and natural images are very different on a pixel level but they are similar in terms of the size and shape of objects, thus YOLO can still predict good bounding boxes and detections."
How did the authors verify that YOLO learns very general representation of objects ?,"The authors verified that YOLO learns very general representations of objects by testing it on both natural images and artwork, and observing that it outperforms other top detection methods like DPM and R-CNN by a wide margin, indicating that YOLO has learned generalizable representations of objects","Since YOLO is trained on full images and end-to-end it can encode contextual information about each class and its appearance. Moreover, it can learn shapes, sizes, and the relationship between objects. Thus it was shown to be generalizable to artwork, although pixel-wise they are different from natural images, and it makes twice as less mistakes with background objects compared to R-CNN.","YOLO is refreshingly simple: see Figure 1. A single convolutional network simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. YOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detection performance. This unified model has several benefits over traditional methods of object detection. Second, YOLO reasons globally about the image when making predictions. Unlike sliding window and region proposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image during training and test time so it implicitly encodes contextual information about classes as well as their appearance. Fast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes background patches in an image for objects because it can’t see the larger context. YOLO makes less than half the number of background errors compared to Fast R-CNN. Third, YOLO learns generalizable representations of objects. When trained on natural images and tested on artwork, YOLO outperforms top detection methods like DPM and R-CNN by a wide margin. Since YOLO is highly generalizable it is less likely to break down when applied to new domains or unexpected inputs. YOLO has good performance on VOC 2007 and its AP degrades less than other methods when applied to artwork. Like DPM, YOLO models the size and shapeof objects, as well as relationships between objects and where objects commonly appear. Artwork and natural images are very different on a pixel level but they are similar in terms of the size and shape of objects, thus YOLO can still predict good bounding boxes and detections. We introduce YOLO, a unified model for object detection. Our model is simple to construct and can be trained directly on full images. Unlike classifier-based approaches, YOLO is trained on a loss function that directly corresponds to detection performance and the entire model is trained jointly."
"The authors claim that autonomous cars would be able to drive without specialized sensors using only fast and accurate algorithms, is that true ?",No,"Theoretically, if the detection algorithms were as fast and accurate as the human visual system, they could drive an autonomous car, but no further discussion is included in the paper. At the time of the writing of the paper, even YOLO was still inferior to other detectors in terms of accuracy. Thus, it is difficult to answer the question precisely.","Humans glance at an image and instantly know what objects are in the image, where they are, and how they interact. The human visual system is fast and accurate, allowing us to perform complex tasks like driving with little conscious thought. Fast, accurate algorithms for object detection would allow computers to drive cars without specialized sensors, enable assistive devices to convey real-time scene information to human users, and unlock the potential for general purpose, responsive robotic systems. YOLO still lags behind state-of-the-art detection systems in accuracy. While it can quickly identify objects in images it struggles to precisely localize some objects, especially small ones. We examine these tradeoffs further in our experiments."
"What does the authors means by reframing object detection as a ""single regression problem"" ?","The authors mean that in traditional object detection methods, the task is broken down into multiple steps, such as feature extraction, classifier training, and localization, but YOLO unifies these steps into a single regression problem, where the network directly predicts the bounding boxes and class probabilities for all objects in the image, simultaneously and end-to-end","Reframing object detection as a simple regression problem means predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from image pixels avoiding complex pipelines and steps which most of the existing (classifier-based) methods do. YOLO can be trained end-to-end and can predict bounding boxes and respective class probabilities directly from an entire image. Also, its loss function directly corresponds to detection performance, which makes optimizing it more intuitive and easier.","Current detection systems repurpose classifiers to perform detection. To detect an object, these systems take a classifier for that object and evaluate it at various locations and scales in a test image. Systems like deformable parts models (DPM) use a sliding window approach where the classifier is run at evenly spaced locations over the entire image [10]. We unify the separate components of object detection into a single neural network. Our network uses features from the entire image to predict each bounding box. It also predicts all bounding boxes across all classes for an image simultaneously. This means our network reasons globally about the full image and all the objects in the image. The YOLO design enables end-to-end training and real-time speeds while maintaining high average precision. We reframe object detection as a single regression problem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities. Using our system, you only look once (YOLO) at an image to predict what objects are present and where they are. YOLO is refreshingly simple: see Figure 1. A single convolutional network simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. YOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detection performance. This unified model has several benefits over traditional methods of object detection. Object detection is a core problem in computer vision. Detection pipelines generally start by extracting a set of robust features from input images (Haar [25], SIFT [23], HOG [4], convolutional features [6]). Then, classifiers [36, 21, 13, 10] or localizers [1, 32] are used to identify objects in the feature space. These classifiers or localizers are run either in sliding window fashion over the whole image or on some subset of regions in the image [35, 15, 39]. We compare the YOLO detection system to several top detection frameworks, highlighting key similarities and differences. We introduce YOLO, a unified model for object detection. Our model is simple to construct and can be trained directly on full images. Unlike classifier-based approaches, YOLO is trained on a loss function that directly corresponds to detection performance and the entire model is trained jointly."
What is the ratio of background errors that Yolo does compared to Fast R-CNN ?,"YOLO makes far fewer background errors than Fast R-CNN. Specifically, YOLO makes less than half the number of background errors compared to Fast R-CNN","YOLO is 3 times less likely to make background mistakes compared to Fast R-CNN (it has 13.6% false positives) as it can reason about the entire image and see the larger context. On top of that, combining YOLO and Fast R-CNN can give a 2.3% improvement in terms of accuracy.","First we compare YOLO with other real-time detection systems on Pascal VOC 2007.

Fast R-CNN makes much fewer localization errors but far more background errors. 13.6% of it’s top detections are false positives that don’t contain any objects. Fast R-CNN is almost 3x more likely to predict background detections than YOLO. YOLO makes far fewer background mistakes than Fast R-CNN. By using YOLO to eliminate background detections from Fast R-CNN we get a significant boost in performance. For every bounding box that R-CNN predicts we check to see if YOLO predicts a similar box. If it does, we give that prediction a boost based on the probability predicted by YOLO and the overlap between the two boxes. Our combined Fast R-CNN + YOLO model is one of the highest performing detection methods. Fast R-CNN gets a 2.3% improvement from the combination with YOLO, boosting it 5 spots up on the public leaderboard."
"Since YOLO sees the entire image during training and testing, doesn't it influence badly on its performance ?","No. YOLO's ability to see the entire image during training and testing does not negatively impact its performance. In fact, it helps YOLO learn generalizable representations of objects and reduces the number of background errors compared to other methods","The paper discusses both advantages and disadvantages of looking at the image as a whole. Processing the entire image, let YOLO be end-to-end, thus predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly. Also, it shows good generalizability to other domains and it copes with background objects much better compared to Fast R-CNN due to looking at the image as a whole. However, to make the entire image consumable to the model, dividing the image into grids and limiting the number of bounding boxes are performed. Because of these and other design decisions, YOLO shows inferior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art detectors. Especially it struggles with localizing objects, small objects, and objects close to each other.","YOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding box predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes and can only have one class. This spatial constraint limits the number of nearby objects that our model can predict. Our model struggles with small objects that appear in groups, such as flocks of birds.

Is it true that YOLO is highly generalizable and performs well in new unseen data ?,"Yes. YOLO is highly generalizable and performs well in new, unseen data","The generalizability of YOLO to unseen data is evaluated by training it on natural images and testing with artwork from Picasso and People-Art datasets. Since YOLO can reason about the entire image and learn the contextual information about the class and its appearance, it shows much better generalizability compared to other state-of-the-art techniques.

"What is the speed of YOLO, when it pushes its mAP performance to 63.4% ?",YOLO achieves a speed of more than 150 frames per second (fps) when it pushes its mean average precision (mAP) performance to 63.4%,"When the basic YOLO model reaches 63.4% mAP on the Pascal dataset, it can run at 45 fps.

10 mAP","Table 1 reveals that the actual speed of Faster R-CNN with VGG-16 is 7fps with 73.2% mAP. At the same time, YOLO has more than 6 times the higher speed of 45 fps with 63.4% mAP on Pascal VOC 2007.","The recent Faster R-CNN replaces selective search with a neural network to propose bounding boxes, similar to Szegedy et al.

What motivated the authors to choose the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset to compare YOLO with other models ?,The authors chose Pascal VOC 2007 because it is a widely used benchmark for object detection and it provides a comprehensive set of annotations for training and evaluating object detection models,"Although the paper does not give explicit reasons why Pascal VOC 2007 dataset was chosen for comparison, we can make an educated guess. It seems like Pascal VOC 2007 is one of the popular datasets for object detection. Also, many other existing methods had been evaluated on it, including Fast R-CNN models (the detections are also publicly available for Fast R-CNN). Additionally, the paper uses VOC 2012 and some other datasets for comparison too.","First we compare YOLO with other real-time detection systems on Pascal VOC 2007.

Why was the IOU metric used and not other segmentation metrics such as the Dice coefficient?,"Sure! Here's the answer to the question based on the provided context:

The IOU metric was used instead of other segmentation metrics like the Dice coefficient because it is more robust to class imbalance and can handle varying object sizes and orientations","The paper does not include explicit discussion regarding using the IOU metric or Dice coefficient, so it is difficult to answer the question just by the information in the paper. In general, the IOU method is used for object detection, while the Dice coefficient is used for image segmentation.","•Correct: correct class and \textrm{IOU}>.5•Localization: correct class, .1<\textrm{IOU}<.5•Similar: class is similar, \textrm{IOU}>.1•Other: class is wrong, \textrm{IOU}>.1•Background: \textrm{IOU}<.1 for any object We use the methodology and tools of Hoiem et al.

"Yolo makes different kinds of mistakes, but it is still really accurate, wouldn't that play against it when using it to boost Fast R-CNN ?","No. YOLO's different mistake patterns compared to Fast R-CNN can actually help boost its performance, despite YOLO's lower accuracy. YOLO's strength in reducing background false positives and localization errors can complement Fast R-CNN's strengths, leading to a significant performance boost","Due to YOLO's architecture, it can handle the background objects better as it has a larger context (it processes the entire image end-to-end) when predicting bounding boxes compared to other models. However, YOLO struggles with localizing objects, especially small ones. On the other hand, Fast R-CNN can localize objects much better, but it has 3 times more problems (13.6%) with background errors compared to YOLO's 4.75%. Thus, assisting the best Fast R-CNN model with YOLO can give a 3.2% boost of accuracy (71.8% to 75%), because it can handle the background objects better.","First we compare YOLO with other real-time detection systems on Pascal VOC 2007. To understand the differences between YOLO and R-CNN variants we explore the errors on VOC 2007 made by YOLO and Fast R-CNN, one of the highest performing versions of R-CNN [14]. Based on the different error profiles we show that YOLO can be used to rescore Fast R-CNN detections and reduce the errors from background false positives, giving a significant performance boost. We also present VOC 2012 results and compare mAP to current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show that YOLO generalizes to new domains better than other detectors on two artwork datasets. Second, YOLO reasons globally about the image when making predictions. Unlike sliding window and region proposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image during training and test time so it implicitly encodes contextual information about classes as well as their appearance. Fast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes background patches in an image for objects because it can’t see the larger context. YOLO makes less than half the number of background errors compared to Fast R-CNN. YOLO struggles to localize objects correctly. Localization errors account for more of YOLO’s errors than all other sources combined. Fast R-CNN makes much fewer localization errors but far more background errors. 13.6% of it’s top detections are false positives that don’t contain any objects. Fast R-CNN is almost 3x more likely to predict background detections than YOLO. YOLO makes far fewer background mistakes than Fast R-CNN. By using YOLO to eliminate background detections from Fast R-CNN we get a significant boost in performance. For every bounding box that R-CNN predicts we check to see if YOLO predicts a similar box. If it does, we give that prediction a boost based on the probability predicted by YOLO and the overlap between the two boxes. The boost from YOLO is not simply a byproduct of model ensembling since there is little benefit from combining different versions of Fast R-CNN. Rather, it is precisely because YOLO makes different kinds of mistakes at test time that it is so effective at boosting Fast R-CNN’s performance. YOLO still lags behind state-of-the-art detection systems in accuracy. While it can quickly identify objects in images it struggles to precisely localize some objects, especially small ones. We examine these tradeoffs further in our experiments. The best Fast R-CNN model achieves a mAP of 71.8%"
Why does YOLO struggle in localizing objects correctly ?,"YOLO struggles in localizing objects correctly due to its strong spatial constraints, which limit the number of nearby objects that can be predicted, and its reliance on coarse features for bounding box predictions","Although YOLO is a really fast model, it usually struggles with localizing small objects in a group or objects near each other. In fact, localization errors take up more than half of all YOLO's errors. It happens because YOLO has only a limited number of bounding boxes per grid cell and the loss function penalizes the errors in the large and small bounding boxes the same. On top of that, the model uses coarse features to predict bounding boxes, and it may have problems with unusual aspect ratios and configurations of objects.","YOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding box predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes and can only have one class. This spatial constraint limits the number of nearby objects that our model can predict. Our model struggles with small objects that appear in groups, such as flocks of birds. YOLO shares some similarities with R-CNN. Each grid cell proposes potential bounding boxes and scores those boxes using convolutional features. However, our system puts spatial constraints on the grid cell proposals which helps mitigate multiple detections of the same object. Our system also proposes far fewer bounding boxes, only 98 per image compared to about 2000 from Selective Search. Finally, our system combines these individual components into a single, jointly optimized model. YOLO struggles to localize objects correctly. Localization errors account for more of YOLO’s errors than all other sources combined. Fast R-CNN makes much fewer localization errors but far more background errors. 13.6% of it’s top detections are false positives that don’t contain any objects. Fast R-CNN is almost 3x more likely to predict background detections than YOLO. On the VOC 2012 test set, YOLO scores 57.9% mAP. This is lower than the current state of the art, closer to the original R-CNN using VGG-16, see Table 3. Our system struggles with small objects compared to its closest competitors. On categories like bottle, sheep, and tv/monitor YOLO scores 8-10% lower than R-CNN or Feature Edit. However, on other categories like cat and train YOLO achieves higher performance. YOLO still lags behind state-of-the-art detection systems in accuracy. While it can quickly identify objects in images it struggles to precisely localize some objects, especially small ones. We examine these tradeoffs further in our experiments. Since our model learns to predict bounding boxes from data, it struggles to generalize to objects in new or unusual aspect ratios or configurations. Our model also uses relatively coarse features for predicting bounding boxes since our architecture has multiple downsampling layers from the input image. Finally, while we train on a loss function that approximates detection performance, our loss function treats errors the same in small bounding boxes versus large bounding boxes. A small error in a large box is generally benign but a small error in a small box has a much greater effect on IOU. Our main source of error is incorrect localizations."
Why did the authors chose to train YOLO using VGG-16 and not other neural network architecture ?,"The authors chose to train YOLO using VGG-16 because it is a more accurate model, but also significantly slower than YOLO. They wanted to compare their faster models to other detection systems that rely on VGG-16, but since it is slower than real-time, they focused on their faster models","In fact, the base YOLO model and Fast YOLO have used GoogLeNet-inspired architecture to VGG-16. The authors claim that they have trained it with VGG-16 and it had better accuracy, however, it was too slow to be real-time. The YOLO model is first pretrained on the ImageNet 1000-class competition dataset and later trained on training and validation data of the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset.","We also train YOLO using VGG-16. This model is more accurate but also significantly slower than YOLO. It is useful for comparison to other detection systems that rely on VGG-16 but since it is slower than real-time the rest of the paper focuses on our faster models. Our network architecture is inspired by the GoogLeNet model for image classification [34]. Our network has 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers. Instead of the inception modules used by GoogLeNet, we simply use 1 × 1 reduction layers followed by 3 × 3 convolutional layers, similar to Lin et al [22]. The full network is shown in Figure 3. We pretrain our convolutional layers on the ImageNet 1000-class competition dataset [30]. For pretraining we use the first 20 convolutional layers from Figure 3 followed by a average-pooling layer and a fully connected layer. We train this network for approximately a week and achieve a single crop top-5 accuracy of 88% on the ImageNet 2012 validation set, comparable to the GoogLeNet models in Caffe’s Model Zoo [24]. We use the Darknet framework for all training and inference [26]. We train the network for about 135 epochs on the training and validation data sets from PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012. When testing on 2012 we also include the VOC 2007 test data for training. Throughout training we use a batch size of 64, a momentum of 0.9 and a decay of 0.0005."
Why does Yolo outperform R-CNN in other categories such as cat and train ?,"YOLO outperforms R-CNN in other categories such as cat and train because it learns generalizable representations of objects, which allows it to adapt well to new domains and unexpected inputs","The paper does not specifically discuss why YOLO is better for cat and train categories in VOC 2012 dataset and worse for the bottle, sheep, and tv/monitor. Thus, it is difficult to answer this question with only the contents of the paper.","Second, YOLO reasons globally about the image when making predictions. Unlike sliding window and region proposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image during training and test time so it implicitly encodes contextual information about classes as well as their appearance. Fast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes background patches in an image for objects because it can’t see the larger context.

On categories like bottle, sheep, and tv/monitor YOLO scores 8-10% lower than R-CNN or Feature Edit. However, on other categories like cat and train YOLO achieves higher performance. Third, YOLO learns generalizable representations of objects. When trained on natural images and tested on artwork, YOLO outperforms top detection methods like DPM and R-CNN by a wide margin. Since YOLO is highly generalizable it is less likely to break down when applied to new domains or unexpected inputs. Table 3: PASCAL VOC 2012 Leaderboard.

"What is ""“Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors” image representation ?","A descriptor pooling method that represents an image as a vector of locally aggregated descriptors, capturing information about the statistics of local descriptors aggregated over the image","“Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors” image representation is a compact representation of an image created by the VLAD technique which is a popular descriptor pooling method that can extract statistical information of the local descriptors aggregated over the image. IT calculates the difference between the feature vectors of an image and a set of learned reference vectors, then summing up these differences to create the image representation vector.","Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) [29]is a popular descriptor pooling method for both instance level retrieval [29] and image classification [22].It captures information about the statisticsof local descriptors aggregated over the image. Whereas bag-of-visual-words [14, 74] aggregation keeps countsof visual words, VLAD stores the sum of residuals (difference vector betweenthe descriptor and its corresponding cluster centre) for each visual word. Formally, given N D-dimensional local image descriptors \{\mathchoice{\mbox{\boldmath$\displaystyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\textstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptscriptstyle\bf x$}}_{i}\} as input,and K cluster centres (“visual words”) \{\mathchoice{\mbox{\boldmath$\displaystyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\textstyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptstyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptscriptstyle\bf c$}}_{k}\} as VLAD parameters,the output VLAD image representation V is K\times D-dimensional.For convenience we will write V as a K\times D matrix, but this matrixis converted into a vector and, after normalization, used asthe image representation. The (j,k) element of V is computedas follows:V(j,k)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_{k}(\mathchoice{\mbox{\boldmath$\displaystyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\textstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptscriptstyle\bf x$}}_{i})\left(x_{i}(j)-c_{k}(j)\right),(1)where x_{i}(j) and c_{k}(j) are the j-th dimensions of the i-th descriptor and k-th cluster centre, respectively.a_{k}(\mathchoice{\mbox{\boldmath$\displaystyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\textstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptscriptstyle\bf x$}}_{i}) denotes the membership ofthe descriptor \mathchoice{\mbox{\boldmath$\displaystyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\textstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptscriptstyle\bf x$}}_{i} to k-th visual word, i.e. it is 1 if cluster \mathchoice{\mbox{\boldmath$\displaystyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\textstyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptstyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptscriptstyle\bf c$}}_{k}is the closest cluster to descriptor \mathchoice{\mbox{\boldmath$\displaystyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\textstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptscriptstyle\bf x$}}_{i} and 0 otherwise.Intuitively, each D-dimensional column k of V records the sum ofresiduals (\mathchoice{\mbox{\boldmath$\displaystyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\textstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptscriptstyle\bf x$}}_{i}-\mathchoice{\mbox{\boldmath$\displaystyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\textstyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptstyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptscriptstyle\bf c$}}_{k}) of descriptors which are assigned to cluster \mathchoice{\mbox{\boldmath$\displaystyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\textstyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptstyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptscriptstyle\bf c$}}_{k}.The matrix V is then L2-normalized column-wise(intra-normalization [3]),converted into a vector,and finally L2-normalized in its entirety [29]."
"To obtain the final compact descriptor of the image, why did the authors use PCA instead of other compression algorithms?.","The authors used PCA instead of other compression algorithms because it has been shown to be effective in reducing the dimensionality of the VLAD descriptor while preserving its discriminative power, as described in the context","Maybe authors found that PCA is  computationally less expensive and much memory and time saving in experiments than other methods. PCA is used to reduce the dimensions of the descriptor to 4096 learnt on the training set, which is discovered experimentally to help in achieving state-of-the-art results on the challenging Tokyo 24/7 dataset as comparisons show that the lower dimensional fVLAD performs similarly to the full size vector.","Furthermore we compare our CNN representations trained for place recognitionagainst the state-of-the-art local feature based compact descriptor, which consists ofVLAD pooling [29] with intra-normalization [3]on top of densely extracted RootSIFTs [43, 2].The descriptor is optionally reduced to 4096 dimensions usingPCA (learnt on the training set) combined with whitening and L2-normalization [25];this setup together with view synthesis yields the state-of-the-art results on the challenging Tokyo 24/7 dataset(c.f. [80]). We follow the standard state-of-the-art procedure to perform dimensionalityreduction of VLAD, as described earlier,i.e. the reduction into 4096-D is performed usingPCA with whitening followed by L2-normalization [25, 80].Figure 5 shows that the lower dimensional f_{VLAD} (-\ast-)performssimilarly to the full size vector (-o-)."
"What is the number of images in the dataset, that is gathered by the authors to train the architecture for place recognition?",76k database images and 315 query images,"They used Weak Supervision as a solution for the lack of labelled data.

Second, to train the architecture for place recognition, we gather a large dataset of multiple panoramic images depicting the same place from different viewpoints over time from the Google Street View Time Machine. Such data is available for vast areas of the world, but provides only weak form of supervision: we know the two panoramas are captured at approximately similar positions based on their (noisy) GPS but we don’t know which parts of the panoramas depict the same parts of the scene."
"All the relevant learning-based approaches fall into one or both of the following two categories: (i) learning for an auxiliary task , and (ii) learning on top of shallow hand-engineered descriptors that cannot be fine-tuned for the target task. How does the authors' approach differs from these two categories?","The authors' approach differs from these two categories by using end-to-end learning, which is not present in the two categories","Authors see that both approaches are
end-to-end learning. Their approach -NetVLAD, shows that training representations directly for the end-task, place recognition, is crucial for obtaining good performance. Representations trained on the end-task of place recognition consistently outperform by a large margin off-the- shelf CNNs on benchmarks illustrating there approach can learn rich yet compact image representations for place recognition and that the popular idea of using pretrained networks “off-the-shelf” is sub-optimal as the networks trained for object or scene classification are not necessary suitable for the end-task of place recognition.","While there have been many improvements in designing betterimage retrieval [2, 3, 12, 11, 17, 26, 27, 29, 25, 32, 48, 51, 52, 53, 54, 71, 78, 79, 82] and place recognition [4, 10, 15, 16, 24, 9, 35, 46, 44, 64, 65, 63, 75, 81, 80] systems, not many works have performedlearning for these tasks.All relevant learning-based approaches fall into one or both of the followingtwo categories:(i) learning for an auxiliary task (e.g. some form of distinctiveness of local features [4, 15, 30, 35, 58, 59, 90]), and (ii) learning on top of shallow hand-engineered descriptors that cannot be fine-tuned for the target task [2, 24, 9, 35, 57]. Both of these are in spirit opposite to the core idea behinddeep learning that has provided a major boost in performance in variousrecognition tasks: end-to-end learning. We will indeed show insection 5.2 that training representations directly for the end-task,place recognition, is crucial for obtaining good performance."

How does the NetVLAD layer differ from the original VLAD?,"The NetVLAD layer differs from the original VLAD in several ways:

1. Trainable parameters: The NetVLAD layer has three sets of trainable parameters, whereas the original VLAD has only one set of parameters.
2. Soft-assignment: The NetVLAD layer uses a soft-assignment mechanism to assign the descriptor to different clusters, whereas the original VLAD uses a hard-assignment mechanism.
3. Decoupling: The NetVLAD layer decouples the sets of parameters for the clusters, allowing for greater flexibility in adapting to new datasets.

In summary, the NetVLAD layer is a more flexible and trainable version of the original VLAD, with the ability to adapt to different datasets and tasks","The original VLAD method uses hand-crafted features and applies the VLAD technique to them by concatenating multiple VLADs. On the other hand, NetVLAD layer uses a CNN to extract features and applies the VLAD technique in a single layer by learning the aggregation weights of the residuals (xi − ck) in different parts of the descriptor space. The NetVLAD layer has three independent sets of parameters, {wk}, {bk} and {ck}, that enables greater flexibility and adaptability to the CNN features than the original VLAD method which uses only {ck}.","In order to profit from years of wisdom produced in image retrieval,we propose to mimic VLAD in a CNN frameworkand design a trainable generalized VLAD layer, NetVLAD. The result is a powerful image representationtrainable end-to-end on the target task (in our case place recognition).To construct a layer amenable to training via backpropagation,it is required that the layer’s operation is differentiable withrespect to all its parameters and the input.Hence, the key challenge is to make the VLAD pooling differentiable, which we describe next.

Our trained representationsignificantly outperforms off-the-shelf CNN models and significantlyimproves over the state-of-the-art on the challenging 24/7 Tokyodataset, as well as on the Oxford and Paris image retrieval benchmarks.The two main components of our architecture– (i) the NetVLAD pooling layer and (ii) weakly supervised rankingloss – are generic CNN building blocks applicable beyond the placerecognition task. The NetVLAD layer offers a powerful poolingmechanism with learnable parameters that can be easily plugged intoany other CNN architecture. The weakly supervised ranking lossopens up the possibility of end-to-end learning for other rankingtasks where large amounts of weakly labelled data are available, forexample, images described with natural language [33]."
Did the authors use the entire Pittsburgh (Pitts250k) dataset for experiments or did they use a subset of the dataset? ,"A subset of the dataset.

The authors used a subset of the Pittsburgh (Pitts250k) dataset for their experiments, specifically the Pitts30k subset, which contains 10k database images in each of the train/val/test sets","They use the entire (Pitts30k) dataset and divide it into three equal parts for training, validation and testing, each containing around 83k database images and 8k queries which are geographically disjoint. However, for some experiments for the seek of facility and faster training, a smaller subset (Pitts30k) is used, containing 10k database images in each of the train/val/test sets, and also geographically disjoint.","contains 250kdatabase images downloaded from Google Street Viewand 24k test queries generated from Street View but taken at differenttimes, years apart.We divide this dataset into three roughly equal partsfor training, validation and testing,each containing around 83kdatabase images and 8k queries,where the division was done geographically to ensure the sets containindependent images.To facilitate faster training, for some experiments,a smaller subset (Pitts30k) is used, containing 10k database imagesin each of the train/val(idation)/test sets, which arealso geographically disjoint."
"Is Google Street View Time Machine used for the first time to create a dataset by the authors, or has it been previously used in another reserach?","No, Google Street View Time Machine has not been previously used in another research. The authors propose to exploit this novel data source for the first time to create a dataset for place recognition",As authors have considered : Google Street View Time Machine was a novel source (at that time) for learning an image representation for place recognition .,"We propose to exploit a new source of data – Google Street View Time Machine –which provides multiple street-level panoramic images taken at different times at close-by spatial locations on the map.As will be seen in section 5.2,this novel data source is precious for learning an image representation for place recognition.As shown in figure 4, the same locations are depictedat different times and seasons, providing the learning algorithm with crucialinformation it can use to discover which features are useful or distracting,and what changes should the image representation be invariant to, in order to achievegood place recognition performance."
What metric is used to compare VLAD methods with their Max pooling counterparts? ,RECALL@1,They use in comparison the recall@1 on Tokyo 24/7,"By comparing f_{VLAD} (-o-) methods with their corresponding f_{max} (-x-) counterpartsit is clear that VLAD pooling is much better than Max pooling for both off-the-shelf and trained representations.NetVLAD performance decreases gracefullywith dimensionality: 128-D NetVLAD performs similarly to 512-D Max(42.9% vs 38.4% recall@1 on Tokyo 24/7),resulting in four timesmore compact representation for the same performance.Furthermore, NetVLAD+whitening outperforms Max pooling convincingly whenreduced to the same dimensionality (60%).See appendix C for more details."
What are the metrics used to compare authors' approach with image retrieval benchmarks?,mAP (mean Average Precision),Authors reported of using mAP to compare their approach with image retrieval benchmark. Mean average precision is used in information retrieval and computer vision tasks to evaluate the performance of a model through its ability to retrieve relevant images from a dataset.,"We use our best performing network (VGG-16, f_{VLAD} with whitening down to 256-D)trained completely on Pittsburgh, to extract image representationsfor standard object and image retrieval benchmarks.Our representation sets the state-of-the-art for compact image representations (256-D)by a large margin on all three datasets, obtaining an mAP of63.5%, 73.5% and 79.9% onOxford 5k [53], Paris 6k [54], Holidays [26], respectively;for example, this is a +20% relative improvement on Oxford 5k.Appendix Ccontains more detailed results."
What are the two place recognition benchmarks used by the authors?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Pittsburgh and Tokyo 24/7",Pittsburgh(Pitts250k) and Tokyo 24/7 benchmarks,"In the following we discuss figure 5,which compares place recognition performance of our method to the baselines outlined aboveon the Pittsburgh and Tokyo 24/7 benchmarks."
The authors crop the CNN at the last convolutional layer and view it as a dense descriptor extractor. Why did the authors do the cropping at the last convolutional layer and not in the middle?,"The authors cropped the CNN at the last convolutional layer because it is more effective for instance retrieval and texture recognition, as observed in [6, 7, 62]","Authors mentioned that they have cropped the CNN at the last convolutional layer and view it as a dense descriptor extractor as they found it work well in experiments i.e.,instance retrieval and texture recognition. However, this point doesn't have enough discussion in the paper but generally speaking, cropping at the end, this way, may obtain good levels of abstraction and compact vector representations as going deeper and deeper, while cropping at middle may not extract the desired features and also, may not be  dense enough to complete this task with good performance.","In order to learn the representation end-to-end, we designa CNN architecture that mimics this standard retrieval pipeline in an unifiedand principled manner with differentiable modules.For step (i), we crop the CNNat the last convolutional layer and view itas a dense descriptor extractor.This has been observed to work well for instance retrieval[6, 7, 62] and texture recognition [13].Namely, the output of the last convolutional layer is aH\times W\times D map which can be considered as a set of D-dimensionaldescriptors extracted at H\times W spatial locations.For step (ii) we design a new pooling layer inspired by the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) [29]that pools extracted descriptors into a fixed image representation and its parameters are learnable via back-propagation.We call this new pooling layer “NetVLAD” layer and describe it in the next section."
"What does ""multi-orientation pooling"" means ?",Multi-orientation pooling refers to the process of aggregating information from different orientations of a 3D object to capture a more holistic sense of the object's shape and structure,"Multi-orientation pooling is a learning strategy in which the rotations around vertical axis are combined with the elevation rotations, although I am not sure what are elevation rotations.","Both of our new networks are sensitive to shape orientation, i.e., they capture different information at different orientations. To capture a more holistic sense of a 3D object, we add an orientation pooling stage that aggregates information from different orientations. Similar to Su-MVCNN [32] which aggregates information from multiple view inputs through a view-pooling layer and follow-on fully connected layers, we sample 3D input from different orientations and aggregate them in a multi-orientation volumetric CNN (MO-VCNN) as shown in Fig 5. At training time, we generate different rotations of the 3D model by changing both azimuth and elevation angles, sampled randomly. A volumetric CNN is firstly trained on single rotations. Then we decompose the network to \text{CNN}_{1} (lower layers) and \text{CNN}_{2} (higher layers) to construct a multi-orientation version. The MO-VCNN’s weights are initialized by a previously trained volumetric CNN with \text{CNN}_{1}’s weights fixed during fine-tuning. While a common practice is to extract the highest level features (features before the last classification linear layer) of multiple orientations, average/max/concatenate them, and train a linear SVM on the combined feature, this is just a special case of the MO-VCNN. Compared to 3DShapeNets [33] which only augments data by rotating around vertical axis, our experiment shows that orientation pooling combined with elevation rotation can greatly increase performance."
"The authors claim that low-frequency information in 3D is discriminative for object classification, is that true ?",Yes,"The reasoning is that low-frequency information in 3D seems to be quite discriminative, because the authors use the resolution of only 30x30x30, which is really low resolution in any case. The only explanation of why the method is still working is that low-frequency information is discriminative.","As shown in Fig 2, even with similar level of object detail, the volumetric CNN (green) is 4.8\% worse than the multi-view CNN (blue). That is, there is still significant room to improve the architecture of volumetric CNNs. This discovery motivates our efforts in Sec 4 to improve volumetric CNNs. Additionally, low-frequency information in 3D seems to be quite discriminative for object classification—it is possible to achieve 89.5\% accuracy (blue) at a resolution of only 30\times 30\times 30. This discovery motivates our efforts in Sec 5 to improve multi-view CNNs with a 3D multi-resolution approach."
How can auxiliary tasks help the volumetric CNN avoid overfitting and improve performances ?,Auxiliary tasks can help the volumetric CNN avoid overfitting and improve performances by providing closely correlated but challenging tasks that encourage the network to continue learning even when overfitting to the main task,The auxiliary tasks are closely related to the main tasks but are difficult to overfit to keep the learning from early convergence even when the main task is overfitted. The property of the auxiliary tasks is that they are supposed to be challenging by using only only partial subvolumes for the predictions. The auxiliary tasks better exploit the discrimnative power of local regions because they do not use additional knowledge about the semantics of the object.,"We propose two network variations that significantly improve state-of-the-art CNNs on 3D volumetric data.The first network is designed to mitigate overfitting by introducing auxiliary training tasks, which are themselves challenging. These auxiliary tasks encourage the network to predict object class labels from partial subvolumes. Therefore, no additional annotation efforts are needed. The second network is designed to mimic multi-view CNNs, as they are strong in 3D shape classification. Instead of using rendering routines from computer graphics, our network projects a 3D shape to 2D by convolving its 3D volume with an anisotropic probing kernel. This kernel is capable of encoding long-range interactions between points. An image CNN is then appended to classify the 2D projection. Note that the training of the projection module and the image classification module is end-to-end. This emulation of multi-view CNNs achieves similar performance to them, using only standard layers in CNN. We observe significant overfitting when we train the volumetric CNN proposed by [33] in an end-to-end fashion (see supplementary). When the volumetric CNN overfits to the training data, it has no incentive to continue learning. We thus introduce auxiliary tasks that are closely correlated with the main task but are difficult to overfit, so that learning continues even if our main task is overfitted.  These auxiliary training tasks also predict the same object labels, but the predictions are made solely on a local subvolume of the input.Without complete knowledge of the object, the auxiliary tasks are more challenging, and can thus better exploit the discriminative power of local regions. This design is different from the classic multi-task learning setting of hetergenous auxiliary tasks, which inevitably requires collecting additional annotations (e.g., conducting both object classification and detection [9]). We provide a detailed analysis over factors that influence the performance of volumetric CNNs, including network architecture and volumn resolution. Based upon our analysis, we strive to improve the performance of volumetric CNNs.We propose two volumetric CNN network architectures that signficantly improve state-of-the-art of volumetric CNNs on 3D shape classification. This result has also closed the gap between volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs, when they are provided with 3D input discretized at 30\times 30\times 30 3D resolution.The first network introduces auxiliary learning tasks by classifying part of an object, which help to scrutize details of 3D objects more deeply.The second network uses long anisotropic kernels to probe for long-distance interactions. Combining data augmentation with a multi-orientation pooling, we observe significant performance improvement for both networks.We also conduct extensive experiments to study the influence of volume resolution, which sheds light on future directions of improving volumetric CNNs."
How can anisotropic probing kernel encode long-range interactions between points of 3D objects ?,"By convolving the 3D volume with an anisotropic probing kernel, the network can capture long-range interactions between points in the 3D object, even when the object is partially occluded or has complex internal structures. The anisotropic probing kernel is capable of encoding these long-range interactions by probing the 3D volume in multiple directions, allowing the network to capture the internal structures of the object","The anisotropic probing kernel is designed specifically to be able to capture long-range interactions between 3D points of the objects. In particular, the kernel is elongated and captures only voxels of the same height and along the probing direction.","We propose two network variations that significantly improve state-of-the-art CNNs on 3D volumetric data.The first network is designed to mitigate overfitting by introducing auxiliary training tasks, which are themselves challenging. These auxiliary tasks encourage the network to predict object class labels from partial subvolumes. Therefore, no additional annotation efforts are needed.

Note that the training of the projection module and the image classification module is end-to-end. This emulation of multi-view CNNs achieves similar performance to them, using only standard layers in CNN. Our anistropic probing network is capable of capturing internal structures of objects through its X-ray like projection mechanism. This is an ability not offered by standard rendering. Combined with multi-orientation pooling (introduced below), it is possible for this probing mechanism to capture any 3D structure, due to its relationship with the Radon transform. The two networks proposed above are both sensitive to model orientation. In the subvolume supervision method, different model orientations define different local subvolumes; in the anisotropic probing method, only voxels of the same height and along the probing direction can have interaction in the early feature extraction stage.Thus it is helpful to augment the training data by varying object orientation and combining predictions through orientation pooling."
Wouldn't training on sub-volumes of a 3D object that isn't much representative of the global object affect the learning of the model negatively ?,"No. The local subvolume approach allows the model to focus on specific regions of the object, which can be more informative and challenging than training on the entire object. This design can actually improve the model's performance by exploiting the discriminative power of local regions","The purpose of the auxiliary tasks is twofold:
1. To serve as a regularization mechanism (make learning more challening in order to prevent overfitting and early convergence).
2. Exploit better discriminative power of local regions, which should improve learning and not negatively impact it.","These auxiliary training tasks also predict the same object labels, but the predictions are made solely on a local subvolume of the input.Without complete knowledge of the object, the auxiliary tasks are more challenging, and can thus better exploit the discriminative power of local regions. This design is different from the classic multi-task learning setting of hetergenous auxiliary tasks, which inevitably requires collecting additional annotations (e.g., conducting both object classification and detection [9])."
"The authors claims that the probing mechanism combined with multi-orientation pooling can capture any 3D structure, is this true ?",Yes,"It is true that the probing mechanism has a relationship with the Radon transform, which is an integral transform whose inverse is used to reconstruct images from medical CT scans and other complex 3D structures such as a map of a planet's polar regions (https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RadonTransform.html#:~:text=The%20Radon%20transform%20is%20an,(Roulston%20and%20Muhleman%201997).). Additionally, orientation pooling aggragates information from different orientations, thus carrying only partial information about the object, which makes it robust to different objects and avoids overfitting to the objects from the training dataset.","Both of our new networks are sensitive to shape orientation, i.e., they capture different information at different orientations. To capture a more holistic sense of a 3D object, we add an orientation pooling stage that aggregates information from different orientations. Our anistropic probing network is capable of capturing internal structures of objects through its X-ray like projection mechanism. This is an ability not offered by standard rendering. Combined with multi-orientation pooling (introduced below), it is possible for this probing mechanism to capture any 3D structure, due to its relationship with the Radon transform. From Table 2, first, the two volumetric CNNs we propose, SubvolumeSup and AniProbing networks, both show superior performance, indicating the effectiveness of our design;second, multi-orientation pooling increases performance for all network variations. This is especially significant for the anisotropic probing network, since each orientation usually only carries partial information of the object."
How are 2D multi resolution filter approaches similar to 3D approaches ?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

2D multi-resolution filter approaches are similar to 3D approaches in that they both use multiple scales to capture information","Similar to 2D multi-resolution filtering approaches, the 3D multi-resolution approaches such as this one capture information at multiple scales. The main difference is that the 3D filtering approach respects the distances in 3D.","Although the multi-view CNN presented by [32] produces compelling results, we are able to improve its performance through a multi-resolution extension with improved data augmentation.We introduce multi-resolution 3D filtering to capture information at multiple scales. We perform sphere rendering (see Sec 3) at different volume resolutions. Note that we use spheres for this discretization as they are view-invariant. In particular, this helps regularize out potential noise or irregularities in real-world scanned data (relative to synthetic training data), enabling robust performance on real-world scans. Note that our 3D multi-resolution filtering is different from classical 2D multi-resolution approaches, since the 3D filtering respects the distance in 3D."
Why did the authors chose the ModelNet dataset for evaluating the developed architectures ?,"The authors chose the ModelNet dataset for evaluating the developed architectures because it is a large and diverse dataset of 3D CAD models, with well-annotated data and a training/testing split provided on the website, which allows for fair comparison of different architectures","The authors follow previous works, such as VoxNet [24[, 3DShapeNets [33], and MVCNN [32] that also use ModelNet test set to evaluate their approaches. In order to be able to compare with them and provide more quantitative results, this paper also evaluates on ModelNet's test set. Additionally, as described in Table 1 (paragraph P7), the authors use ModelNet to provide additional evaluations and ablative analyses, which is more suitable to be done on synthetic data than RGB-D data.","We use ModelNet [33] for our training and testing datasets. ModelNet currently contains 127,915 3D CAD models from 662 categories. ModelNet40, a subset including 12,311 models from 40 categories, is well annotated and can be downloaded from the web. The authors also provide a training and testing split on the website, in which there are 9,843 training and 2,468 test models444VoxNet [24] uses the train/test split provided on the website and report average class accuracy on the 2,468 test split. 3DShapeNets [33] and MVCNN [32] use another train/test split comprising the first 80 shapes of each category in the “train” folder (or all shapes if there are fewer than 80) and the first 20 shapes of each category in the “test” folder, respectively.. We use this train/test split for our experiments. We use the same volumetric CNN model, the end-to-end learning verion of 3DShapeNets [33], to train and test on three variations of augmented data (Table 1). Similar trend is observed for other volumetric CNN variations."
Who were the annotators of the new real-world scanning dataset used for real-world reconstruction ?,The annotators were not specified,"The reconstructions are not create by manual annotations. Instead, the authors use publicly-available VoxelHashing framework [25] to obtain dense 3D reconstructions. Additionally, the authors have performed a course, manual segmentation of the object of interest, but this is not related to the reconstruction.","We provide a new real-world scanning dataset benchmark, comprising 243 objects of 12 categories; the geometry is captured with an ASUS Xtion Pro and a dense reconstruction is obtained using the publicly-available VoxelHashing framework [25].For each scan, we have performed a coarse, manual segmentation of the object of interest.In addition, each scan is aligned with the world-up vector.While there are existing datasets captured with commodity range sensors – e.g., [29, 34, 31] – this is the first containing hundreds of annotated models from dense 3D reconstructions.The goal of this dataset is to provide an example of modern real-time 3D reconstructions; i.e., structured representations more complete than a single RGB-D frame but still with many occlusions. This dataset is used as a test set. In addition to providing extensive experiments on 3D CAD model datasets, we also introduce a dataset of real-world 3D data, constructed using dense 3D reconstruction taken with [25]. Experiments show that our networks can better adapt from synthetic data to this real-world data than previous methods."
Why didn't the authors try different methods of data augmentation for 3D objects ?,"The authors did not try different methods of data augmentation for 3D objects because they found that orientation pooling combined with elevation rotation was sufficient to greatly increase performance, compared to only rotating around the vertical axis as done in 3DShapeNets [33]","The authors improve upon previous augmentation strategies and provide analyses to compare each combination of the augmentation strategy (azimuth rotation (AZ), AZ + translation, and AZ + elevation rotation), and conclude that the latter gives the best results. Please note that augmentations on 3D objects are not as trivial as the ones in 2D so providing novel insights w.r.t. data augmentation is quite valuable. I am not sure what would be the possible additional augmentation method in 3D that authors should have tried...","Compared with 2D image datasets, currently available 3D shape datasets are limited in scale and variation. To fully exploit the design of our networks, we augment the training data with different azimuth and elevation rotations.This allows the first network to cover local regions at different orientations, and the second network to relate distant points at different relative angles. Compared to 3DShapeNets [33] which only augments data by rotating around vertical axis, our experiment shows that orientation pooling combined with elevation rotation can greatly increase performance. We use the same volumetric CNN model, the end-to-end learning verion of 3DShapeNets [33], to train and test on three variations of augmented data (Table 1). Similar trend is observed for other volumetric CNN variations."
Why did  the authors didn't use other metrics to evaluate/compare the performance of the architectures ?,"The authors did not use other metrics to evaluate/compare the performance of the architectures because they were focused on object classification, and average instance accuracy is a commonly used and appropriate metric for this task","The authors compare with previous works w.r.t. classification accuracy, in particular the average instance accuracy and average class accuracy. The general issue with introducing novel metrics that haven't been used by prior works is that, first, the motivation for using this metric has to be provided and, second, a significant additional work has to be done in order to evaluate previous works on this new metric.","Intuitively, a volumetric representation should encode as much information, if not more, than its multi-view counterpart. However, experiments indicate that multi-view CNNs produce superior performance in object classification. Fig 2 reports the classification accuracy on the ModelNet40 dataset by state-of-the-art volumetric/multi-view architectures111We train models by replicating the architecture of [33] for volumetric CNNs and [32] for multi-view CNNs. All networks are trained in an end-to-end fashion. All methods are trained/tested on the same split for fair comparison. The reported numbers are average instance accuracy. See Sec 6 for details.. A volumetric CNN based on voxel occupancy (green) is 7.3\% worse than a multi-view CNN (yellow). By default, we report classification accuracy on all models in the test set (average instance accuracy). For comparisons with previous work we also report average class accuracy."
What are the difference and similarities between volumetric representations CNN &  multi-view representations CNN ?,"Volumetric representations CNNs and multi-view representations CNNs have similarities and differences:

Similarities:

* Both can be used to train convolutional neural networks.
* Both can capture 3D shape information.

Differences:

* Volumetric representations encode 3D shapes as 3D tensors of binary or real values, while multi-view representations encode 3D shapes as collections of renderings from multiple viewpoints.
* Multi-view representations capture more detail than volumetric representations.
* Multi-view CNNs have shown superior performance in object classification.

In summary, while both types of representations can be used for object classification, multi-view representations have been shown to be more effective, likely due to the increased detail captured by the multiple viewpoints","The similarities between volumetric and multi-view representation are:
- when stored as tensors, both representations can easily be used to train convolutional neural networks, i.e., volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs.
- the multi-view CNN down-samples each rendered view to 227x227 pixels to maintain a similar computational cost, the volumetric CNN uses a 30x30x30 occupancy grid. Note that 30x30x30 is approximately 227x227. Therefore, the implementations have similar computational costs.

On the other hand, there are many differences:
- a volumetric representation should encode as much information, if not more, than its multi-view counterpart (however, experiments indicate that multi-view CNNs produce superior performance in object classification)
- the input to the multi-view CNN captures more detail.
- the volumetric representation encodes a 3D shape as a 3D tensor of binary or real values, while the multi-view representation encodes a 3D shape as a collection of renderings from multiple viewpoints","Two representations of generic 3D shapes are popularly used for object classification, volumetric and multi-view (Fig 1). The volumetric representation encodes a 3D shape as a 3D tensor of binary or real values. The multi-view representation encodes a 3D shape as a collection of renderings from multiple viewpoints. Stored as tensors, both representations can easily be used to train convolutional neural networks, i.e., volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs. Intuitively, a volumetric representation should encode as much information, if not more, than its multi-view counterpart. However, experiments indicate that multi-view CNNs produce superior performance in object classification. Fig 2 reports the classification accuracy on the ModelNet40 dataset by state-of-the-art volumetric/multi-view architectures111We train models by replicating the architecture of [33] for volumetric CNNs and [32] for multi-view CNNs. All networks are trained in an end-to-end fashion. All methods are trained/tested on the same split for fair comparison. The reported numbers are average instance accuracy. See Sec 6 for details.. A volumetric CNN based on voxel occupancy (green) is 7.3\% worse than a multi-view CNN (yellow). We investigate this performance gap in order to ascertain how to improve volumetric CNNs. The gap seems to be caused by two factors: input resolution and network architecture differences. The multi-view CNN down-samples each rendered view to 227\times 227 pixels (Multi-view Standard Rendering in Fig 1); to maintain a similar computational cost, the volumetric CNN uses a 30\times 30\times 30 occupancy grid (Volumetric Occupancy Grid in Fig 1)222Note that 30\times 30\times 30\approx 227\times 227.. As shown in Fig 1, the input to the multi-view CNN captures more detail."
What is the reasons that made the authors choose the 3D data from CAD model & RGB-D sensors ?,"The authors chose 3D data from CAD models and RGB-D sensors because they provide a more complete and structured representation of real-world scenes than single RGB-D frames, but still with many occlusions, which is the goal of the dataset","The authors choose CAD models and RGB-D data for several reasons. First, to demonstrate that, while learning only the synthetic CAD models they are still able to generalize to real-world RGB-D reconstructions. Second, the RGB-D dataset is exclusively proposed in this paper, and it is purposely difficult (contains occlusions and reconstruction noise). Third, by using multiple sources of data, they demonstrate that the model is robust to different data types.","We provide a new real-world scanning dataset benchmark, comprising 243 objects of 12 categories; the geometry is captured with an ASUS Xtion Pro and a dense reconstruction is obtained using the publicly-available VoxelHashing framework [25].For each scan, we have performed a coarse, manual segmentation of the object of interest.In addition, each scan is aligned with the world-up vector.While there are existing datasets captured with commodity range sensors – e.g., [29, 34, 31] – this is the first containing hundreds of annotated models from dense 3D reconstructions.The goal of this dataset is to provide an example of modern real-time 3D reconstructions; i.e., structured representations more complete than a single RGB-D frame but still with many occlusions. This dataset is used as a test set. In addition to providing extensive experiments on 3D CAD model datasets, we also introduce a dataset of real-world 3D data, constructed using dense 3D reconstruction taken with [25]. Experiments show that our networks can better adapt from synthetic data to this real-world data than previous methods. Wu et al. [33] lift 2.5D to 3D with their 3DShapeNets approach by categorizing each voxel as free space, surface or occluded, depending on whether it is in front of, on, or behind the visible surface (i.e., the depthvalue) from the depth map.The resulting representation is a 3D binary voxel grid, which is the input to a CNN with 3D filter banks.Their method is particularly relevant in the context of this work, as they are the first to apply CNNs on a 3D representation.A similar approach is VoxNet [24], which also uses binary voxel grids and a corresponding 3D CNN architecture.The advantage of these approaches is that it can process different sources of 3D data, including LiDAR point clouds, RGB-D point clouds, and CAD models; we likewise follow this direction."
Why was the model trained with synthetic data rather than reel 3D data directly?,"Sure! Here's the answer to the question based on the provided context:

To facilitate better adaptation from synthetic data to real-world data","The authors train on synthetic data for several reasons. Based on the evidential paragraph P0, one of the reasons is that the proposed method can better adapt from synthetic to real data than previous methods. Other than the evidential information, it is easier to collect a large amount of synthetic data compared to real data, especially for training purposes.","In addition to providing extensive experiments on 3D CAD model datasets, we also introduce a dataset of real-world 3D data, constructed using dense 3D reconstruction taken with [25]. Experiments show that our networks can better adapt from synthetic data to this real-world data than previous methods."
"What does ""2.5D data"" means ?","""2.5D data"" refers to data that has two dimensions (like a 2D image) but also includes a third dimension (depth) that is not fully captured, such as a depth map or a point cloud with limited range","2.5D data is 2D information (image plane) plus the information about the relative depths of points, i.e., voxels - whether the points are behind or in front of the visible surface.","Wu et al. [33] lift 2.5D to 3D with their 3DShapeNets approach by categorizing each voxel as free space, surface or occluded, depending on whether it is in front of, on, or behind the visible surface (i.e., the depthvalue) from the depth map.The resulting representation is a 3D binary voxel grid, which is the input to a CNN with 3D filter banks.Their method is particularly relevant in the context of this work, as they are the first to apply CNNs on a 3D representation.A similar approach is VoxNet [24], which also uses binary voxel grids and a corresponding 3D CNN architecture.The advantage of these approaches is that it can process different sources of 3D data, including LiDAR point clouds, RGB-D point clouds, and CAD models; we likewise follow this direction."
Is there a reason of not realizing pre-processing techniques to the real data to remove noise before the training ?,"No.

The authors do not apply pre-processing techniques to the real data before training because they want to assess the performance of the volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs on real-world reconstructions, including the noise and irregularities present in the real data. By using real data and not pre-processing it, the authors can evaluate the robustness of their methods and the ability of the networks to handle real-world data","The reason is that, in the real data, it will not always be possible to do the pre-processing steps, especially if they require tedious manual noise removal which cannot be completely done automatically. Thus, by using the noisy dataset, the authors demonstrate that their model is robust to real-world noise and occlusions.","Although the multi-view CNN presented by [32] produces compelling results, we are able to improve its performance through a multi-resolution extension with improved data augmentation.We introduce multi-resolution 3D filtering to capture information at multiple scales. We perform sphere rendering (see Sec 3) at different volume resolutions. Note that we use spheres for this discretization as they are view-invariant. In particular, this helps regularize out potential noise or irregularities in real-world scanned data (relative to synthetic training data), enabling robust performance on real-world scans. Note that our 3D multi-resolution filtering is different from classical 2D multi-resolution approaches, since the 3D filtering respects the distance in 3D. We further assess the performance of volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs on real-world reconstructions in Table 4. All methods are trained on CAD models in ModelNet40 but tested on real data, which may be highly partial, noisy, or oversmoothed (Fig 6).Our networks continue to outperform state-of-the-art results. In particular, our 3D multi-resolution filtering is quite effective on real-world data, possibly because the low 3D resolution component filters out spurious and noisy micro-structures. Example results for object retrieval can be found in supplementary."
"What does ""anisotropic probing kernel"" means ?","An anisotropic probing kernel is a type of neural network kernel that is elongated in certain directions, allowing it to capture long-range interactions in the input data",The anisotropic probing kernels can be seen as a special type of convolutional layer. These kernels are elongated in 3D and can thus encode long-range interactions between the points. They are an alternative to using standard computer graphics rendering. Using anisotropic probing kernels helps to capture the global structure of the 3D volume.,"We propose two network variations that significantly improve state-of-the-art CNNs on 3D volumetric data.The first network is designed to mitigate overfitting by introducing auxiliary training tasks, which are themselves challenging. These auxiliary tasks encourage the network to predict object class labels from partial subvolumes. Therefore, no additional annotation efforts are needed. The second network is designed to mimic multi-view CNNs, as they are strong in 3D shape classification. Instead of using rendering routines from computer graphics, our network projects a 3D shape to 2D by convolving its 3D volume with an anisotropic probing kernel. This kernel is capable of encoding long-range interactions between points. An image CNN is then appended to classify the 2D projection. Note that the training of the projection module and the image classification module is end-to-end. This emulation of multi-view CNNs achieves similar performance to them, using only standard layers in CNN. Key to this network is the use of an elongated anisotropic kernel which helps capture the global structure of the 3D volume.As illustrated in Fig 4, the neural network has two modules: an anisotropic probing module and a network in network module.The anisotropic probing module contains three convolutional layers of elongated kernels, each followed by a nonlinear ReLU layer.Note that both the input and output of each layer are 3D tensors. In contrast to traditional isotropic kernels, an anisotropic probing module has the advantage of aggregating long-range interactions in the early feature learning stage with fewer parameters. As a comparison, with traditional neural networks constructed from isotropic kernels, introducing long-range interactions at an early stage can only be achieved through large kernels, which inevitably introduce many more parameters.After anisotropic probing, we use an adapted NIN network [23] to address the classification problem. Our anistropic probing network is capable of capturing internal structures of objects through its X-ray like projection mechanism. This is an ability not offered by standard rendering. Combined with multi-orientation pooling (introduced below), it is possible for this probing mechanism to capture any 3D structure, due to its relationship with the Radon transform. The two networks proposed above are both sensitive to model orientation. In the subvolume supervision method, different model orientations define different local subvolumes; in the anisotropic probing method, only voxels of the same height and along the probing direction can have interaction in the early feature extraction stage.Thus it is helpful to augment the training data by varying object orientation and combining predictions through orientation pooling. From Table 2, first, the two volumetric CNNs we propose, SubvolumeSup and AniProbing networks, both show superior performance, indicating the effectiveness of our design;second, multi-orientation pooling increases performance for all network variations. This is especially significant for the anisotropic probing network, since each orientation usually only carries partial information of the object."
Why did the authors choose a format of the 3D input as 30x30x30 ?,To maintain a similar computational cost,"The volumetric representation is costly - in order to keep the same computational cost as multi-view representation of 227x227, the volumetric representation can only have 30x30x30 resolution. Probably using higher resolution in both cases causes other issues.","We investigate this performance gap in order to ascertain how to improve volumetric CNNs. The gap seems to be caused by two factors: input resolution and network architecture differences. The multi-view CNN down-samples each rendered view to 227\times 227 pixels (Multi-view Standard Rendering in Fig 1); to maintain a similar computational cost, the volumetric CNN uses a 30\times 30\times 30 occupancy grid (Volumetric Occupancy Grid in Fig 1)222Note that 30\times 30\times 30\approx 227\times 227.. As shown in Fig 1, the input to the multi-view CNN captures more detail."
"Is it true, as the authors suggest, that a neural network's depth is essential to its success?",Yes,"As mentioned in many paragraphs, network depth is essential for expressing more complex functions, which is also essential for success.","Many recent empirical breakthroughs in supervised machine learning have been achieved through large and deep neural networks. Network depth (the number of successive computational layers) has played perhaps the most important role in these successes. For instance, within just a few years, the top-5 image classification accuracy on the 1000-class ImageNet dataset has increased from \sim84% [1] to \sim95% [2, 3] using deeper networks with rather small receptive fields [4, 5].Other results on practical machine learning problems have also underscored the superiority of deeper networks [6] in terms of accuracy and/or performance. We see a different picture for the CIFAR-100 dataset (right) with performance degrading noticeably when removing any of the first \approx 40 layers.This suggests that for complex problems a highway network can learn to utilize all of its layers, while for simpler problems like MNIST it will keep many of the unneeded layers idle. Such behavior is desirable for deep networks in general, but appears difficult to obtain using plain networks. Our primary contribution is to show that extremely deep highway networks can be trained directly using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), in contrast to plain networks which become hard to optimize as depth increases (Section 3.1).Deep networks with limited computational budget (for which a two-stage training procedure mentioned above was recently proposed [25]) can also be directly trained in a single stage when converted to highway networks. Their ease of training is supported by experimental results demonstrating that highway networks also generalize well to unseen data."
"What does ""information highways"" mean ?","Information highways refer to the pathways in a network that allow for easy flow of information across many layers, inspired by Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent networks",'information highways' means that some information is not lost while passing through the layer.,"The last column of Figure 2 displays the block outputs and visualizes the concept of “information highways”.Most of the outputs stay constant over many layers forming a pattern of stripes.Most of the change in outputs happens in the early layers (\approx 15 for MNIST and \approx 40 for CIFAR-100). To overcome this, we take inspiration from Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent networks [29, 30]. We propose to modify the architecture of very deep feedforward networks such that information flow across layers becomes much easier. This is accomplished through an LSTM-inspired adaptive gating mechanism that allows for computation paths along which information can flow across many layers without attenuation. We call such paths information highways. They yield highway networks, as opposed to traditional ‘plain’ networks.111This paper expands upon a shorter report on Highway Networks [31]. More recently, a similar LSTM-inspired model was also proposed [32]."
What makes the extremely deep architectures important to study ?,"The ability to represent certain function classes far more efficiently than shallow networks, as demonstrated by the n bit parity problem example","Deep architecture has made a lot of research and breakthroughs with this deep architecture, making it important that it can express many kinds of functions.","Many recent empirical breakthroughs in supervised machine learning have been achieved through large and deep neural networks. Network depth (the number of successive computational layers) has played perhaps the most important role in these successes. For instance, within just a few years, the top-5 image classification accuracy on the 1000-class ImageNet dataset has increased from \sim84% [1] to \sim95% [2, 3] using deeper networks with rather small receptive fields [4, 5].Other results on practical machine learning problems have also underscored the superiority of deeper networks [6] in terms of accuracy and/or performance. In fact, deep networks can represent certain function classes far more efficiently than shallow ones. This is perhaps most obvious for recurrent nets, the deepest of them all. For example, the n bit parity problem can in principle be learned by a large feedforward net with n binary input units, 1 output unit, and a single but large hidden layer. But the natural solution for arbitrary n is a recurrent net with only 3 units and 5 weights, reading the input bit string one bit at a time, making a single recurrent hidden unit flip its state whenever a new 1 is observed [7].Related observations hold for Boolean circuits [8, 9] and modern neural networks [10, 11, 12]."
"The authors claims that the LSTM networks systems allow the flow of information across many layers without attenuation, is that true?",Yes,"Inspired by LSTM, the authors designed an information highway that adaptively passes information back, which is effective when there are many layers, so LSTM is also effective for many layers.","The last column of Figure 2 displays the block outputs and visualizes the concept of “information highways”.Most of the outputs stay constant over many layers forming a pattern of stripes.Most of the change in outputs happens in the early layers (\approx 15 for MNIST and \approx 40 for CIFAR-100).

What are the difference between plain networks and deep highway networks ?,"Deep highway networks have the ability to smoothly vary their behavior between that of a layer that simply passes its inputs through and a layer that performs a complex computation, whereas plain networks have a fixed behavior. This allows deep highway networks to avoid the degradation in performance that is typically seen in deep plain networks. Additionally, deep highway networks can be trained more easily and with a lower computational budget than plain networks, and they generalize well to unseen data","A highway network is a layer that uses an information highway layer, and a plain network is a general layer. In highway networks, increasing layer depth does not affect performance, but in plain networks, it can. One layer of the plain network is made up of normal computation units, whereas the highway network is made up of block units.","Thus, depending on the output of the transform gates, a highway layer can smoothly vary its behavior between that of H and that of a layer which simply passes its inputs through. Just as a plain layer consists of multiple computing units such that the i^{th} unit computes y_{i}=H_{i}(\mathbf{x}), a highway network consists of multiple blocks such that the i^{th} block computes a block state H_{i}(\mathbf{x}) and transform gate output T_{i}(\mathbf{x}). Finally, it produces the block output y_{i}=H_{i}(\mathbf{x})*T_{i}(\mathbf{x})+x_{i}*(1-T_{i}(\mathbf{x})), which is connected to the next layer.222Our pilot experiments on training very deep networks were successful with a more complex block design closely resembling an LSTM block “unrolled in time”. Here we report results only for a much simplified form. To support the hypothesis that highway networks do not suffer from increasing depth, we conducted a series of rigorous optimization experiments, comparing them to plain networks with normalized initialization [16, 17]. The training curves for the best performing networks for each depth are shown in Figure 1. As expected, 10 and 20-layer plain networks exhibit very good performance (mean loss <1e^{-4}), which significantly degrades as depth increases, even though network capacity increases.Highway networks do not suffer from an increase in depth, and 50/100 layer highway networks perform similar to 10/20 layer networks. The 100-layer highway network performed more than 2 orders of magnitude better compared to a similarly-sized plain network.It was also observed that highway networks consistently converged significantly faster than plain ones. A possible objection is that many layers might remain unused if the transform gates stay closed. Our experiments show that this possibility does not affect networks adversely—deep and narrow highway networks can match/exceed the accuracy of wide and shallow maxout networks, which would not be possible if layers did not perform useful computations. Additionally, we can exploit the structure of highways to directly evaluate the contribution of each layer as shown in Figure 4. For the first time, highway networks allow us to examine how much computation depth is needed for a given problem, which can not be easily done with plain networks. Our primary contribution is to show that extremely deep highway networks can be trained directly using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), in contrast to plain networks which become hard to optimize as depth increases (Section 3.1).Deep networks with limited computational budget (for which a two-stage training procedure mentioned above was recently proposed [25]) can also be directly trained in a single stage when converted to highway networks. Their ease of training is supported by experimental results demonstrating that highway networks also generalize well to unseen data."
Why is the carry gate C can be expressed in function of the transform gate T with C = 1 - T ?,"Sure! Here's the answer to the question based on the given context:

C = 1 - T

This is because the carry gate C can be expressed as the difference between 1 and the transform gate T, which means that C represents the amount of output that is not transformed from the input","By defining C = 1-T, the authors made it automatically learn how much information to change or leave as is.","We refer to T as the transform gate and C as the carry gate, since they express how much of the output is produced by transforming the input and carrying it, respectively. For simplicity, in this paper we set C=1-T, giving"
"From the left graph of Figure 1, we observe that even the deepest highway network has same/worse performance than the plain network, so what are the benefits of using the highway networks with deeper layers ?","Dynamic routing and utilization of all layers.

Despite the deepest highway network having the same/worse performance as the plain network in the left graph of Figure 1, the benefits of using highway networks with deeper layers lie in their ability to dynamically route and utilize all layers, as observed in the mean transform gate activity and single example transform gate outputs in Figure 2. This allows the network to learn a more efficient use of its layers for each input, leading to better generalization and performance on unseen data","Although highway networks do not perform well at best, they do not break down significantly when stacked deeply. Also, there is freedom in setting the number of depths, and it can be learned well with vanilla SGD. In addition, meaningful outputs come out from all layers and information can be handed over dynamically.","The training curves for the best performing networks for each depth are shown in Figure 1. As expected, 10 and 20-layer plain networks exhibit very good performance (mean loss <1e^{-4}), which significantly degrades as depth increases, even though network capacity increases.Highway networks do not suffer from an increase in depth, and 50/100 layer highway networks perform similar to 10/20 layer networks. The 100-layer highway network performed more than 2 orders of magnitude better compared to a similarly-sized plain network.It was also observed that highway networks consistently converged significantly faster than plain ones. One possible advantage of the highway architecture over hard-wired shortcut connections is that the network can learn to dynamically adjust the routing of the information based on the current input.This begs the question: does this behaviour manifest itself in trained networks or do they just learn a static routing that applies to all inputs similarly.A partial answer can be found by looking at the mean transform gate activity (second column) and the single example transform gate outputs (third column) in Figure 2.Especially for the CIFAR-100 case, most transform gates are active on average, while they show very selective activity for the single example.This implies that for each sample only a few blocks perform transformation but different blocks are utilized by different samples. We see a different picture for the CIFAR-100 dataset (right) with performance degrading noticeably when removing any of the first \approx 40 layers.This suggests that for complex problems a highway network can learn to utilize all of its layers, while for simpler problems like MNIST it will keep many of the unneeded layers idle. Such behavior is desirable for deep networks in general, but appears difficult to obtain using plain networks. Very deep highway networks, on the other hand, can directly be trained with simple gradient descent methods due to their specific architecture. This property does not rely on specific non-linear transformations, which may be complex convolutional or recurrent transforms, and derivation of a suitable initialization scheme is not essential.The additional parameters required by the gating mechanism help in routing information through the use of multiplicative connections, responding differently to different inputs, unlike fixed “skip” connections. A possible objection is that many layers might remain unused if the transform gates stay closed. Our experiments show that this possibility does not affect networks adversely—deep and narrow highway networks can match/exceed the accuracy of wide and shallow maxout networks, which would not be possible if layers did not perform useful computations.

What hyperparameters values were used to train both the plain and highway networks ?,"For both plain and highway networks, the following hyperparameters were used for training:

* Initial learning rate: 0.01
* Momentum: 0.9
* Learning rate exponential decay factor: 0.5
* Activation function: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
* Initial value for transform gate bias (for highway networks): -5.

These hyperparameters were selected based on a random search of 100 runs for both plain and highway networks, and were kept fixed for all experiments",Both the plain network and the highway network set the best hyperparameters after 100 experiments.,"All networks were trained using SGD with momentum. An exponentially decaying learning rate was used in Section 3.1. For the rest of the experiments, a simpler commonly used strategy was employed where the learning rate starts at a value \lambda and decays according to a fixed schedule by a factor \gamma. \lambda, \gamma and the schedule were selected once based on validation set performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and kept fixed for all experiments.All convolutional highway networks utilize the rectified linear activation function [16] to compute the block state H. To provide a better estimate of the variability of classification results due to random initialization, we report our results in the format Best (mean \pm std.dev.) based on 5 runs wherever available. Experiments were conducted using Caffe [33] and Brainstorm (https://github.com/IDSIA/brainstorm) frameworks. Source code, hyperparameter search results and related scripts are publicly available at http://people.idsia.ch/~rupesh/very_deep_learning/. We trained both plain and highway networks of varying varying depths on the MNIST digit classification dataset.All networks are thin: each layer has 50 blocks for highway networks and 71 units for plain networks, yielding roughly identical numbers of parameters (\approx5000) per layer.In all networks, the first layer is a fully connected plain layer followed by 9, 19, 49, or 99 fully connected plain or highway layers. Finally, the network output is produced by a softmax layer.We performed a random search of 100 runs for both plain and highway networks to find good settings for the following hyperparameters: initial learning rate, momentum, learning rate exponential decay factor & activation function (either rectified linear or tanh). For highway networks, an additional hyperparameter was the initial value for the transform gate bias (between -1 and -10). Other weights were initialized using the same normalized initialization as plain networks."
"Does it really assist bridge long-term temporal dependencies early in learning, as the authors say, to bias the gates in LSTM networks initially?",No,"Contrary to the authors' expectations, most of the biases were said to be reduced during training. In CIFAR-100, it is said that the biases increase according to the depth of the gradient. Authors explain that this is because strong negative biases at low depths are not used to close the gate.","The transform gate biases of the two networks were initialized to -2 and -4 respectively.It is interesting to note that contrary to our expectations most biases decreased further during training.For the CIFAR-100 network the biases increase with depth forming a gradient.Curiously this gradient is inversely correlated with the average activity of the transform gates, as seen in the second column.This indicates that the strong negative biases at low depths are not used to shut down the gates, but to make them more selective.This behavior is also suggested by the fact that the transform gate activity for a single example (column 3) is very sparse.The effect is more pronounced for the CIFAR-100 network, but can also be observed to a lesser extent in the MNIST network."
"What are the reasons behind the guidelines of choosing values of {-1,-2 and -3} for the initial bias for convolutional highway network of depth {10, 20 and 30} ?","The values of -1, -2, and -3 for the initial bias in convolutional highway networks of depth 10, 20, and 30 are chosen based on the random search results to find good hyperparameters for the networks. These values were found to perform well in the experiments and were consistent across different depths","Although not explicitly stated, given that the authors selected the best hyperparameters out of 100 experiments, it is highly likely that the initial bias was also selected by these experiments.","We trained both plain and highway networks of varying varying depths on the MNIST digit classification dataset.All networks are thin: each layer has 50 blocks for highway networks and 71 units for plain networks, yielding roughly identical numbers of parameters (\approx5000) per layer.In all networks, the first layer is a fully connected plain layer followed by 9, 19, 49, or 99 fully connected plain or highway layers.

"The authors claim that no attention mechanism has been applied for image classification task before, is that true ?",No,"The related works that the authors mention  do not use the same attention mechanism they use in this paper, but it is impossible to know just from this paper whether their claim that the attention method they used was never applied before to the image classification task is true.","In image classification, top-down attention mechanism has been applied using different methods: sequential process, region proposal and control gates. Sequential process  [23, 12, 37, 7] models image classification as a sequential decision. Thus attention can be applied similarly with above. This formulation allows end-to-end optimization using RNN and LSTM and can capture different kinds of attention in a goal-driven way."
What do the authors mean by attention-aware features in the context of images ? ,"Attention-aware features in the context of images refer to features that are selectively focused on by the attention mechanism, which enhances different representations of objects at a specific location","The authors are talking about features that were learned using the attention mechanism. The model focuses on such features, which can include color, scale, or spatial information, when it processes an image for classification. For example, the attention mechanism can learn that blue pixels in the background of the image from the sky are not important for image classification, and the model will consequently reduce the contribution of those pixels to the final classification result.","Not only a friendly face but also red color will draw our attention. The mixed nature of attention has been studied extensively in the previous literatures [34, 16, 23, 40]. Attention not only serves to select a focused location but also enhances different representations of objects at that location. Previous works formulate attention drift as a sequential process to capture different attended aspects. However, as far as we know, no attention mechanism has been applied to feedforward network structure to achieve state-of-art results in image classification task. Recent advances of image classification focus on training feedforward convolutional neural networks using “very deep” structure [27, 33, 10]. Soft attention developed in recent work [3, 17] can be trained end-to-end for convolutional network. Our Residual Attention Network incorporates the soft attention in fast developing feedforward network structure in an innovative way. Recent proposed spatial transformer module [17] achieves state-of-the-art results on house number recognition task. A deep network module capturing top information is used to generate affine transformation. The affine transformation is applied to the input image to get attended region and then feed to another deep network module. The whole process can be trained end-to-end by using differentiable network layer which performs spatial transformation. Attention to scale [3] uses soft attention as a scale selection mechanism and gets state-of-the-art results in image segmentation task. The Residual Attention Network alleviates above problems. In Attention Module, each trunk branch has its own mask branch to learn attention that is specialized for its features. As shown in Fig.1, in hot air balloon images, blue color features from bottom layer have corresponding sky mask to eliminate background, while part features from top layer are refined by balloon instance mask. Besides, the incremental nature of stacked network structure can gradually refine attention for complex images. The experiment results are shown in Table 1, the mixed attention has the best performance. Previous works normally focus on only one type of attention, for example scale attention [3] or spatial attention [17], which puts additional constrain on soft mask by weight sharing or normalization. However, as supported by our experiments, making attention change adaptively with features without additional constraint leads to the best performance. (1) Increasing Attention Modules lead to consistent performance improvement, as different types of attention are captured extensively. Fig.1 shows an example of different types of attentions for a hot air balloon image. The sky attention mask diminishes background responses while the balloon instance mask highlighting the bottom part of the balloon."
"They claim that the attention mechanism bring more discriminative feature representation, is that true ?","Yes. The Residual Attention Network's attention mechanism brings more discriminative feature representation by capturing multiple types of attention extensively, as demonstrated in the example of the hot air balloon image","The attention masks successfully learn meaningful information from the dataset and their usage resulted in state-of-the-art results, which indicates that the attention mechanism does learn more discriminative features.","The Residual Attention Network alleviates above problems.

Which specific metrics are improved when increasing attention modules ?,Performance,The Top-1 and Top-5 error metrics are improved when increasing attention modules.,"The experiment results are shown in Table 1, the mixed attention has the best performance.

However, as supported by our experiments, making attention change adaptively with features without additional constraint leads to the best performance. We train these networks using different mechanisms and summarize the results in the Table 3.As shown in Table 3, the networks trained using attention residual learning technique consistently outperform the networks trained with baseline method which proves the effectiveness of our method.The performance increases with the number of Attention Module when applying attention residual learning. In contrast, the performance of networks trained with “naive attention learning” method suffers obvious degradation with increased number of Attention Module. We compare our Attention-92 evaluated using single crop on the ILSVRC 2012 validation set with state-of-the-art algorithms.Table 7 shows the results.Our Attention-92 outperforms ResNet-200 with a large margin. The reduction on top-1 error is 0.6\%.Note that the ResNet-200 network contains 32\% more parameters than Attention-92.The computational complexity of Attention-92 shown in the Table 7 suggests that our network reduces nearly half training time comparing with ResNet-200 by adding attention mechanism and reducing trunk depth.Above results suggest that our model enjoys high efficiency and good performance."
What are the metrics used to compare the performance of the residual network to the other models ?,"The performance of the residual network is compared using the following metrics:

* Top-1 error
* Top-5 error
* Test error
* FLOPs (float-point operations per second)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the residual network and compare it to other models, such as ResNet, Inception, and ResNeXt","The main metrics used to compare different methods were Top-1 and Top-5 error, test error on the CIFAR datasets, the number of parameters and the number of FLOPs. The mean absolute response of output features of each stage was also used to compare their method with ResNet.","In this section, we evaluate the performance of proposed Residual Attention Network on a series of benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 [19], and ImageNet [5].Our experiments contain two parts. In the first part, we analyze the effectiveness of each component in the Residual Attention Network including attention residual learning mechanism and different architectures of soft mask branch in the Attention Module.After that, we explore the noise resistance property. Given limited computation resources, we choose CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset to conduct these experiments. Finally, we compare our network with state-of-the-art results in CIFAR dataset.In the second part, we replace the Residual Unit with Inception Module and ResNeXt to demonstrate our Residual Attention Network surpasses origin networks both in parameter efficiency and final performance.We also compare image classification performance with state-of-the-art ResNet and Inception on ImageNet dataset. We train these networks using different mechanisms and summarize the results in the Table 3.As shown in Table 3, the networks trained using attention residual learning technique consistently outperform the networks trained with baseline method which proves the effectiveness of our method.The performance increases with the number of Attention Module when applying attention residual learning. In contrast, the performance of networks trained with “naive attention learning” method suffers obvious degradation with increased number of Attention Module. To understand the benefit of attention residual learning, we calculate mean absolute response value of output layers for each stage. We use Attention-164 to conduct this experiment.As shown in the Fig. 4, the response generated by the network trained using naive attention learning quickly vanishes in the stage 2 after four Attention Modules compared with network trained using attention residual learning.The Attention Module is designed to suppress noise while keeping useful information by applying dot product between feature and soft mask. However, repeated dot product will lead to severe degradation of both useful and useless information in this process.The attention residual learning can relieve signal attenuation using identical mapping, which enhances the feature contrast.Therefore, it gains benefits from noise reduction without significant information loss, which makes optimization much easier while improving the discrimination of represented features.In the rest of the experiments, we apply this technique to train our networks. We compare ResNet-164 network with Attention-92 network under different noise levels.The Table 5 shows the results.The test error of Attention-92 network is significantly lower than ResNet-164 network with the same noise level.In addition, when we increase the ratio of noise, test error of Attenion-92 declines slowly compared with ResNet-164 network.These results suggest that our Residual Attention Network can perform well even trained with high level noise data.When the label is noisy, the corresponding mask can prevent gradient caused by label error to update trunk branch parameters in the network.In this way, only the trunk branch is learning the wrong supervision information and soft mask branch masks the wrong label. We compare our Residual Attention Network with state-of-the-art methods including ResNet [11] and Wide ResNet [39] on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.The results are shown in Table 6.Our Attention-452 outperforms all the baseline methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.Note that Attention-92 network achieves 4.99\% test error on CIFAR-10 and 21.71\% test error on CIFAR-100 compared with 5.46\% and 24.33\% test error on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 for ResNet-164 network under similar parameter size.In addition, Attention-236 outperforms ResNet-1001 using only half of the parameters. It suggests that our Attention Module and attention residual learning scheme can effectively reduce the number of parameters in the network while improving the classification performance. (2) It is able to incorporate with state-of-the-art deep network structures in an end-to-end training fashion. Specifically, the depth of our network can be easily extended to hundreds of layers. Our Residual Attention Network outperforms state-of-the-art residual networks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and challenging ImageNet [5] image classification dataset with significant reduction of computation (69% forward FLOPs). In this experiment, we explore the efficiency of proposed Residual Attention Network.We compare Attention-56 with ResNet-152 [10].The ResNet-152 has 50 trunk Residual Units and 60.2\times 10^{6} parameters compared with 18 trunk Residual Units and 31.9\times 10^{6} parameters in Attention-56.We evaluate our model using single crop scheme on the ImageNet validation set and show results in Table 7.The Attention-56 network outperforms ResNet-152 by a large margin with a 0.4\% reduction on top-1 error and a 0.26\% reduction on top-5 error.More importantly, Attention-56 network achieves better performance with only 52% parameters and 56% FLOPs compared with ResNet-152, which suggests that the proposed attention mechanism can significantly improve network performance while reducing the model complexity. When the basic unit is ResNeXt, the AttentionNeXt-56 network performance is the same as ResNeXt-101 while the parameters and FLOPs are significantly fewer than ResNeXt-101.For Inception, The AttentionIncepiton-56 outperforms Inception-ResNet-v1 [32] by a margin with a 0.94% reduction on top-1 error and a 0.21% reduction on top-5 error.The results show that our method can be applied on different network structures. We compare our Attention-92 evaluated using single crop on the ILSVRC 2012 validation set with state-of-the-art algorithms.Table 7 shows the results.Our Attention-92 outperforms ResNet-200 with a large margin. The reduction on top-1 error is 0.6\%.Note that the ResNet-200 network contains 32\% more parameters than Attention-92.The computational complexity of Attention-92 shown in the Table 7 suggests that our network reduces nearly half training time comparing with ResNet-200 by adding attention mechanism and reducing trunk depth.Above results suggest that our model enjoys high efficiency and good performance."
What are the consequences of stacking a really big number of attention module in the performance of attention modules? ,The performance of attention modules will suffer from obvious degradation if a really big number of attention modules are stacked,"If naive stacking, too many attention modules will cause a drastic performance drop as the mask values will converge to 0. However, the model in the paper uses their own stacking method, which avoids the downfall of naive stacking. The only consequence when using the paper's stacking method is that the model will require more parameters and FLOPs.","However, naive stacking Attention Modules leads to the obvious performance drop. First, dot production with mask range from zero to one repeatedly will degrade the value of features in deep layers. Second, soft mask can potentially break good property of trunk branch, for example, the identical mapping of Residual Unit. (1) Increasing Attention Modules lead to consistent performance improvement, as different types of attention are captured extensively. Fig.1 shows an example of different types of attentions for a hot air balloon image. The sky attention mask diminishes background responses while the balloon instance mask highlighting the bottom part of the balloon. We train these networks using different mechanisms and summarize the results in the Table 3.As shown in Table 3, the networks trained using attention residual learning technique consistently outperform the networks trained with baseline method which proves the effectiveness of our method.The performance increases with the number of Attention Module when applying attention residual learning. In contrast, the performance of networks trained with “naive attention learning” method suffers obvious degradation with increased number of Attention Module. To understand the benefit of attention residual learning, we calculate mean absolute response value of output layers for each stage. We use Attention-164 to conduct this experiment.As shown in the Fig. 4, the response generated by the network trained using naive attention learning quickly vanishes in the stage 2 after four Attention Modules compared with network trained using attention residual learning.The Attention Module is designed to suppress noise while keeping useful information by applying dot product between feature and soft mask. However, repeated dot product will lead to severe degradation of both useful and useless information in this process.The attention residual learning can relieve signal attenuation using identical mapping, which enhances the feature contrast.Therefore, it gains benefits from noise reduction without significant information loss, which makes optimization much easier while improving the discrimination of represented features.In the rest of the experiments, we apply this technique to train our networks. We propose a Residual Attention Network which stacks multiple Attention Modules. The benefits of our network are in two folds: it can capture mixed attention and is an extensible convolutional neural network. The first benefit lies in that different Attention Modules capture different types of attention to guide feature learning. Our experiments on the forms of activation function also validate this point: free form mixed attention will have better performance than constrained (including single) attention. The second benefit comes from encoding top-down attention mechanism into bottom-up top-down feedforward convolutional structure in each Attention Module. Thus, the basic Attention Modules can be combined to form larger network structure. Moreover, residual attention learning allows training very deep Residual Attention Network. The performance of our model surpasses state-of-the-art image classification methods, i.e. ResNet on CIFAR-10 (3.90% error), CIFAR-100 (20.67% error), and challenging ImageNet dataset (0.6% top-1 accuracy improvement) with only 46\% trunk depth and 69\% forward FLOPs (comparing with ResNet-200). In the future, we will exploit different applications of deep Residual Attention Network such as detection and segmentation to better explore mixed attention mechanism for specific tasks. (1) Stacked network structure: Our Residual Attention Network is constructed by stacking multiple Attention Modules. The stacked structure is the basic application of mixed attention mechanism. Thus, different types of attention are able to be captured in different Attention Modules. (2) Attention Residual Learning: Stacking Attention Modules directly would lead to the obvious performance drop. Therefore, we propose attention residual learning mechanism to optimize very deep Residual Attention Network with hundreds of layers. "
How would stacking attention modules directly woud lead to performance drop? Why is the attention residual learning mechanism necessary?,"Stacking attention modules directly would lead to performance drop due to the degradation of features in deep layers caused by repeated dot production with mask ranges from zero to one, and the potential breakage of good properties of trunk branches, such as identical mapping of residual units. The attention residual learning mechanism is necessary to ease these problems by modifying the output of attention modules and using identical mapping to enhance feature contrast and reduce signal attenuation","Because of the mask values being between 0 and 1, and the fact that naive stacking attention modules means using a dot product on the resulting masks, naive stacking causes a performance drop as the dot product of several modules will converge towards 0. The attention residual learning mechanism changes this by making the lower bound of the mask values the original features instead of 0.","However, naive stacking Attention Modules leads to the obvious performance drop. First, dot production with mask range from zero to one repeatedly will degrade the value of features in deep layers. Second, soft mask can potentially break good property of trunk branch, for example, the identical mapping of Residual Unit. We propose attention residual learning to ease the above problems. Similar to ideas in residual learning, if soft mask unit can be constructed as identical mapping, the performances should be no worse than its counterpart without attention. Thus we modify output H of Attention Module asH_{i,c}(x)=(1+M_{i,c}(x))*F_{i,c}(x)(3)M(x) ranges from [0,1], with M(x) approximating 0, H(x) will approximate original features F(x). We call this method attention residual learning.Our stacked attention residual learning is different from residual learning. In the origin ResNet, residual learning is formulated as H_{i,c}(x)=x+F_{i,c}(x), where F_{i,c}(x) approximates the residual function. In our formulation, F_{i,c}(x) indicates the features generated by deep convolutional networks. The key lies on our mask branches M(x). They work as feature selectors which enhance good features and suppress noises from trunk features.In addition, stacking Attention Modules backs up attention residual learning by its incremental nature. Attention residual learning can keep good properties of original features, but also gives them the ability to bypass soft mask branch and forward to top layers to weaken mask branch’s feature selection ability. Stacked Attention Modules can gradually refine the feature maps. As show in Fig.1, features become much clearer as depth going deeper. By using attention residual learning, increasing depth of the proposed Residual Attention Network can improve performance consistently. As shown in the experiment section, the depth of Residual Attention Network is increased up to 452 whose performance surpasses ResNet-1001 by a large margin on CIFAR dataset. To understand the benefit of attention residual learning, we calculate mean absolute response value of output layers for each stage. We use Attention-164 to conduct this experiment.As shown in the Fig. 4, the response generated by the network trained using naive attention learning quickly vanishes in the stage 2 after four Attention Modules compared with network trained using attention residual learning.The Attention Module is designed to suppress noise while keeping useful information by applying dot product between feature and soft mask. However, repeated dot product will lead to severe degradation of both useful and useless information in this process.The attention residual learning can relieve signal attenuation using identical mapping, which enhances the feature contrast.Therefore, it gains benefits from noise reduction without significant information loss, which makes optimization much easier while improving the discrimination of represented features.In the rest of the experiments, we apply this technique to train our networks."
"What does ""bottom-up top-down feedforward structure"" means ?",A bottom-up top-down feedforward structure refers to a type of neural network architecture that combines both bottom-up and top-down processing in a single feedforward process. It mimics the bottom-up and top-down paths of human cortex and is used in tasks such as image segmentation and human pose estimation,"The bottom-up top-down feedforward structure is a combination of a bottom-up fast feedforward process that creates low resolution features maps to quickly collect global information, and a top-down attention feedback process that uses the global information along with the original feature maps to create features for inference.","However, recent advances of image classification focus on training feedforward convolutional neural networks using “very deep” structure [27, 33, 10]. The feedforward convolutional network mimics the bottom-up paths of human cortex. Various approaches have been proposed to further improve the discriminative ability of deep convolutional neural network. VGG [27], Inception [33] and residual learning [10] are proposed to train very deep neural networks. Stochastic depth [14], Batch Normalization [15] and Dropout [28] exploit regularization for convergence and avoiding overfitting and degradation. The design of soft attention structure in our Residual Attention Network is inspired by recent development of localization oriented task, i.e. segmentation [22, 25, 1] and human pose estimation [24]. These tasks motivate researchers to explore structure with fined-grained feature maps. The frameworks tend to cascade a bottom-up and a top-down structure. The bottom-up feedforward structure produces low resolution feature maps with strong semantic information. After that, a top-down network produces dense features to inference on each pixel. Skip connection [22] is employed between bottom and top feature maps and achieved state-of-the-art result on image segmentation. The recent stacked hourglass network [24] fuses information from multiple scales to predict human pose, and benefits from encoding both global and local information. Following previous attention mechanism idea in DBN [21], our mask branch contains fast feed-forward sweep and top-down feedback steps. The former operation quickly collects global information of the whole image, the latter operation combines global information with original feature maps. In convolutional neural network, the two steps unfold into bottom-up top-down fully convolutional structure. (3) Bottom-up top-down feedforward attention: Bottom-up top-down feedforward structure has been successfully applied to human pose estimation [24] and image segmentation [22, 25, 1]. We use such structure as part of Attention Module to add soft weights on features. This structure can mimic bottom-up fast feedforward process and top-down attention feedback in a single feedforward process which allows us to develop an end-to-end trainable network with top-down attention. The bottom-up top-down structure in our work differs from stacked hourglass network [24] in its intention of guiding feature learning."
Why was ResNet network chosen as baseline method ,"ResNet was chosen as a baseline method because it is a state-of-the-art image classification network, and its performance is used as a reference point to compare the performance of the proposed Residual Attention Network","ResNet was state-of-the-art at the time, according to the paper. Therefore, it makes sense to compare their method with ResNet.","We compare our Residual Attention Network with state-of-the-art methods including ResNet [11] and Wide ResNet [39] on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.The results are shown in Table 6.Our Attention-452 outperforms all the baseline methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.Note that Attention-92 network achieves 4.99\% test error on CIFAR-10 and 21.71\% test error on CIFAR-100 compared with 5.46\% and 24.33\% test error on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 for ResNet-164 network under similar parameter size.In addition, Attention-236 outperforms ResNet-1001 using only half of the parameters.

Is choosing NAL as a baseline a good choice knowing that it always results in performance drop ?,No,"As there was no other available comparison, NAL seems to be the only choice for the baseline.","In this experiment, we evaluate the effectiveness of attention residual learning mechanism.Since the notion of attention residual learning (ARL) is new, no suitable previous methods are comparable therefore we use “naive attention learning” (NAL) as baseline.Specifically, “naive attention learning” uses Attention Module where features are directly dot product by soft mask without attention residual learning.We set the number of Attention Module in each stage m = {1, 2, 3, 4}. For Attention Module, this leads to Attention-56 (named by trunk layer depth), Attention-92, Attention-128 and Attention-164 respectively."
"The authors claims that the  performance increase with the number of attention module, is that true, knowing that they tried only m = {1,2,3,4} ?","Sure! Here's my answer:

No.

The authors did not observe a significant performance increase with the number of attention modules (m) beyond m=4, despite trying values of m up to 6","It seems true as they also tried m = 5 and 6 and performance still improved, as seen in Table 6.","Table 6: Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10/100. †: the Attention-452 consists of Attention Module with hyper-parameters setting: {p = 2, t = 4, r = 3} and 6 Attention Modules per stage."
"How is using an encoder-decoder structure as a mask different than local convolutions soft masks, a part from the test error ?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the given context:

The encoder-decoder structure allows for multi-scale information processing, which benefits the soft attention optimization process, whereas local convolutions soft masks only process information within a single scale","The local convolutions' soft mask only consists of three Residual units, which remain the same size. However, the encoder-decoder structure consists of downsampling and upsampling layers.",We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of encoder-decoder structure by comparing with local convolutions without any down sampling or up sampling. The local convolutions soft mask consists of three Residual Units using the same number of FLOPs.The Attention-56 is used to construct Attention-Encoder-Decoder-56 and Attention-Local-Conv-56 respectively.Results are shown in Table 4.The Attention-Encoder-Decoder-56 network achieves lower test error 5.52\% compared with Attention-Local-Conv-56 network 6.48\% with a considerable margin 0.94\%. The result suggests that the soft attention optimization process will benefit from multi-scale information.
What does the confusion matrix Q in the authors noisy label robustness experiment refers to?,"The confusion matrix Q in the authors' noisy label robustness experiment refers to a matrix that represents the predicted labels of the model against the true labels of the dataset, where the true labels are corrupted with noise",The confusion matrix Q shows how many images were correctly labeled and how many images were purposely incorrectly labeled for the noise experiment.,"In this experiment, we show our Residual Attention Network enjoys noise resistant property on CIFAR-10 dataset following the setting of paper [31].The confusion matrix Q in our experiment is set as follows:Q=\left(\begin{matrix}r&\frac{1-r}{9}&\cdots&\frac{1-r}{9}\\\frac{1-r}{9}&r&\cdots&\frac{1-r}{9}\\\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\\frac{1-r}{9}&\frac{1-r}{9}&\cdots&r\\\end{matrix}\right)_{10\times 10}(7) where r denotes the clean label ratio for the whole dataset."
Why did the authors chose to do experiments on different basic units to prove the generalization of the residual attention network?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

To demonstrate the generalization of the residual attention network (RAN) to different basic units, the authors performed experiments on various network structures, including ResNeXt and Inception.

The results show that our method can be applied on different network structures."
"They claim that in brain tumours, there is a hierarchical layout of sub-components. Is this True ? Any related experiments that proved it ?","Yes.

The article mentions that brain tumors have a hierarchical layout of sub-components, and this is supported by various experiments. For example, the reference segmentations provided in the BRATS challenge (Menze et al., 2015) include four tumor tissue classes: necrotic core, edema, non-enhancing, and enhancing core. This hierarchical layout reflects the complex nature of brain tumors, where different sub-components have different characteristics and behaviors.

Experiments have shown that this hierarchical layout is important for accurately assessing the relative volume of tumor sub-components, which is crucial for planning radiotherapy and treatment follow-up (Wen et al., 2010). Accurate segmentation of these sub-components can help clinicians and researchers better understand the complexity of brain pathologies and develop more effective treatment strategies",Previous literature state the importance of understanding the sub-component layout of brain tumors for diagnosis and treatment. It can therefore be inferred that these sub-components are created in a hierarchical way as the brain tumor develops. It seems unlikely that the authors conducted additional experiments.,"The quantitative analysis of lesions requires accurate lesion segmentation in multi-modal, three-dimensional images which is a challenging task for a number of reasons. The heterogeneous appearance of lesions including the large variability in location, size, shape and frequency make it difficult to devise effective segmentation rules.It is thus highly non-trivial to delineate contusions, edema and haemorrhages in TBI (Irimia et al. (2012)), or sub-components of brain tumors such as proliferating cells and necrotic core (Menze et al. (2015)). The arguably most accurate segmentation results can be obtained through manual delineation by a human expert which is tedious, expensive, time-consuming, impractical in larger studies, and introduces inter-observer variability. Additionally, for deciding whether a particular region is part of a lesion multiple image sequences with varying contrasts need to be considered, and the level of expert knowledge and experience are important factors that impact segmentation accuracy. Hence, in clinical routine often only qualitative, visual inspection, or at best crude measures like approximate lesion volume and number of lesions are used (Yuh et al. (2012); Wen et al. (2010)). In order to capture and better understand the complexity of brain pathologies it is important to conduct large studies with many subjects to gain the statistical power for drawing conclusions across a whole patient population. The development of accurate, automatic segmentation algorithms has therefore become a major research focus in medical image computing with the potential to offer objective, reproducible, and scalable approaches to quantitative assessment of brain lesions. For brain tumors, we evaluate our system on the data from the 2015 Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BRATS) (Menze et al. (2015)). The training set consists of 220 cases with high grade (HG) and 54 cases with low grade (LG) glioma for which corresponding reference segmentations are provided. The segmentations include the following tumor tissue classes: 1) necrotic core, 2) edema, 3) non-enhancing and 4) enhancing core. The test set consists of 110 cases of both HG and LG but the grade is not revealed. Reference segmentations for the test set are hidden and evaluation is carried out via an online system. For evaluation, the four predicted labels are merged into different sets of whole tumor (all four classes), the core (classes 1,3,4), and the enhancing tumor (class 4)333For interpretation of the results note that, to the best of our knowledge, cases where the “enhancing tumor” class is not present in the manual segmentation are considered as zeros for the calculation of average performance by the evaluation platform, lowering the upper bound for this class.. For each subject, four MRI sequences are available, FLAIR, T1, T1-contrast and T2. The datasets are pre-processed by the organizers and provided as skull-stripped, registered to a common space and resampled to isotropic 1mm^{3} resolution. Dimensions of each volume are 240\times240\times155. We add minimal pre-processing of normalizing the brain-tissue intensities of each sequence to have zero-mean and unit variance. Finally, accurate delineation of the pathology is important in the case of brain tumors, where estimation of the relative volume of a tumor’s sub-components is required for planning radiotherapy and treatment follow-up (Wen et al. (2010))."
What are the examples of the high level features that separate the anatomical structures for lesions regions identification ?,"The network learns to identify the ventricles, CSF, white and gray matter, revealing that differentiation of tissue type is beneficial for lesion segmentation","Figure 14 shows that the network learns to identify the ventricles, CSF, white and gray matter, with each filter identifying different tissue types, indicating that learning the differences in the features of different tissue types is helpful for lesion segmentation.","The discriminative power of the learned features is indicated by the success of recent CNN-based systems in matching human performance in domains where it was previously considered too ambitious (He et al. (2015); Silver et al. (2016)). Analysis of the automatically extracted information could potentially provide novel insights and facilitate research on pathologies for which little prior knowledge is currently available. In an attempt to illustrate this, we explore what patterns have been learned automatically for the lesion segmentation tasks. We visualize the activations of DeepMedic’s FMs when processing a subject from our TBI database. Many appearing patterns are difficult to interpret, especially in deeper layers. In Fig. 14 we provide some examples that have an intuitive explanation. One of the most interesting findings is that the network learns to identify the ventricles, CSF, white and gray matter. This reveals that differentiation of tissue type is beneficial for lesion segmentation. This is in line with findings in the literature, where segmentation performance of traditional classifiers was significantly improved by incorporation of tissue priors (Van Leemput et al. (1999); Zikic et al. (2012)). It is intuitive that different types of lesions affect different parts of the brain depending on the underlying mechanisms of the pathology. A rigorous analysis of spatial cues extracted by the network may reveal correlations that are not well defined yet."
Is using 46 Images for training and 15 images for testing enough for the model to learn the features well and generalize to new unseen cases ?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

NO.

The limited number of training images (46) and testing images (15) may not be sufficient for the model to learn the features well and generalize to new unseen cases, especially when dealing with a complex dataset like BRATS. The model may overfit to the limited training data, leading to poor generalization performance on new cases",The results show that the performance of the model drops when faced with testing data that was acquired by centers that did not provide any data in the training dataset. It can be inferred that having a more diverse dataset or utilizing techniques that can help make the CNN more robust to these differences can help generalization.,"Table 3 shows the results of our method on the BRATS test data. Results of other submissions are not accessible. The decrease in performance is possibly due to the the inclusion of test images that vary significantly from the training data, such as cases acquired in clinical centers that did not provide any of the training images, something that was confirmed by the organisers. Note that performance gains obtained with the CRF are larger in this case. This indicates not only that its configuration has not overfitted to the training database but also that the CRF is robust to factors of variation between acquisition sites, which complements nicely the more sensitive CNN. A general point should be made about the performance drop observed when our system is applied on test datasets of BRATS and ISLES in comparison to its cross-validated performance on the training data. In both cases, subsets of the test images were acquired in clinical centers different from the ones of training datasets. Differences in scanner type and acquisition protocols have significant impact on the appearance of the images. The issue of multi-center data heterogeneity is considered a major bottleneck for enabling large-scale imaging studies. This is not specific to our approach, but a general problem in medical image analysis. One possible way of making the CNN invariant to the data heterogeneity is to learn a generative model for the data acquisition process, and use this model in the data augmentation step. This is a direction we explore as part of future work."
Why does a deeper network with smaller kernel size have better performances ?,"Greater discriminative power due to additional non-linearities and better quality of local optima, despite the reduction in element-wise multiplications and trainable parameters","Deeper networks exhibit better performance as they introduce more non-linearities and converge towards better local optima. But, adding more layers increase both computation time and the number of parameters. This could cause the network to be prone to overfitting. Therefore, kernel sizes were reduced such that the number of parameters were similar to the original shallow networks, helping with generalization by reducing overfitting while still receiving the positive effect of having more layers.","Deeper networks have greater discriminative power due to the additional non-linearities and better quality of local optima (Choromanska et al. (2015)). However, convolutions with 3D kernels are computationally expensive in comparison to the 2D variants, which hampers the addition of more layers. Additionally, 3D architectures have a larger number of trainable parameters, with each layer adding C_{l}C_{l-1}\prod_{i=\{x,y,z\}}{\bm{\kappa}_{l}^{(i)}} weights to the model. C_{l} is the number of FMs in layer l and \bm{\kappa}_{l}^{\{x,y,z\}} the size of its kernel in the respective spatial dimension. Overall this makes the network increasingly prone to over-fitting. In order to build a deeper 3D architecture, we adopt the sole use of small 3^{3} kernels that are faster to convolve with and contain less weights. This design approach was previously found beneficial for classification of natural images (Simonyan and Zisserman (2014)) but its effect is even more drastic on 3D networks. When compared to common kernel choices of 5^{3} (Zikic et al. (2014); Urban et al. (2014); Prasoon et al. (2013)) and in our baseline CNN, the smaller 3^{3} kernels reduce the element-wise multiplications by a factor of approximately 5^{3}/3^{3}\approx 4.6 while reducing the number of trainable parameters by the same factor. Thus deeper network variants that are implicitly regularised and more efficient can be designed by simply replacing each layer of common architectures with more layers that use smaller kernels (Fig. 4)."
What are the signs that showed that BigDeep+ has been overfitting ?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the given context:

Overfitting is shown by signs of decreased performance on the test set","As seen in Figure 8, despite BigDeep+ having a similar capacity to DeepMedic, the mean validation accuracy of BigDeep+ converges to a lower accuracy than that of DeepMedic. The same applies to the mean DSC for the two models. Therefore, it can be inferred that BigDeep+ is suffering from overfitting on the training data.","Figure 8 shows the improvement DeepMedic achieves over the single pathway model Deep+. In Fig. 9 we show two representative visual examples of this improvement when using the multi-scale CNN. Finally, we confirm that the performance increase can be accounted to the additional context and not the additional capacity of DeepMedic. To this end, we build a big single-scale model by doubling the FMs at each of the 9-layers of Deep+ and adding two hidden layers. This 11-layers deep and wide model, referred to as “BigDeep+”, has the same number of parameters as DeepMedic. The performance of the model is not improved, while showing signs of over-fitting."
"The authors claim that the brain MRI scan are often anisotropic, is that true ?",Yes,The authors state that most of the sequences within their TBI dataset are anisotropic.,"Acquired brain MRI scans are often anisotropic. Such is the case for most sequences in our TBI dataset, which have been acquired with lower axial resolution, except for the isotropic MPRAGE. We perform a series of experiments to investigate the behaviour of 2D networks and assess the benefit of processing 3D context in this setting."
Who were recruited to annotate the visible lesions? and what did they base their annotation on ?,Neurologists and radiologists were recruited to annotate the visible lesions. They based their annotation on the FLAIR and GE sequences,"It is implied that the annotations were done by experts at the Neurosciences Critical Care Unit at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.","Sixty-six patients with moderate-to-severe TBI who required admission to the Neurosciences Critical Care Unit at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, UK, underwent imaging using a 3-Tesla Siemens Magnetom TIM Trio within the first week of injury.

The structural MRI sequences that are used in this work are isotropic MPRAGE (1mm×mm\timesitalic_m italic_m ×1mm×mm\timesitalic_m italic_m ×1mm), axial FLAIR, T2 and Proton Density (PD) (0.7mm×mm\timesitalic_m italic_m ×0.7mm×mm\timesitalic_m italic_m ×5mm), and Gradient-Echo (GE) (0.86mm×mm\timesitalic_m italic_m ×0.86mm×mm\timesitalic_m italic_m ×5mm). All visible lesions were manually annotated on the FLAIR and GE sequences with separate labeling for each lesion type. In nine patients the presence of hyperintense white matter lesions that were felt to be chronic in nature were also annotated. Artifacts, for example, signal loss secondary to intraparenchymal pressure probes, were also noted. For the purpose of this study we focus on binary segmentation of all abnormalities within the brain tissue. Thus, we merged all classes that correspond to intra-cerebral abnormalities into a single “lesion” label. Extra-cerebral pathologies such as epidural and subdural hematoma were treated as background. We excluded two datasets because of corrupted FLAIR images, two cases because no lesions were found and one case  because of a major scanning artifact corrupting the images. This results in a total of 61 cases used for quantitative evaluation. Brain masks were obtained using the ROBEX tool (Iglesias et al. (2011)). All images were resampled to an isotropic 1mm^{3} resolution, with dimensions 193\times229\times193 and affinely registered (Studholme et al. (1999)) to MNI space using the atlas by Grabner et al. (2006). No bias field correction was used as preliminary results showed that this can negatively affect lesion appearance. Image intensities were normalized to have zero-mean and unit variance, as it has been reported that this improves CNN results (Jarrett et al. (2009))."
What are the benefits of normalization with zero-mean techniques compared to other normalization techniques? have they been tested ?,"Normalization with zero-mean techniques has been shown to improve the performance of deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in medical image analysis tasks. This is because zero-mean normalization helps to reduce the effect of image intensity variations, which can be particularly important in medical imaging where image intensities can vary significantly between patients and even within the same image. Other normalization techniques, such as global normalization, may not be as effective in reducing these intensity variations and may even introduce artifacts into the images. While other normalization techniques have been tested in medical image analysis, zero-mean normalization has been shown to be particularly effective in improving the performance of CNNs in this context",The paper cites Jarrett et al. as the reason why they chose zero-mean normalization techniques. The benefits of normalization with zero-mean techniques therefore cannot be answered by the paper. It can be inferred that they did not test this claim themselves.,"Sixty-six patients with moderate-to-severe TBI who required admission to the Neurosciences Critical Care Unit at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, UK, underwent imaging using a 3-Tesla Siemens Magnetom TIM Trio within the first week of injury.

How did the authors showed that the methods performed worse on the data coming from the second clinical center? Using which metrics ?,"The authors showed that the methods performed worse on the data coming from the second clinical center using the metric of performance on the test set. They compared the performance of their method and other submissions on the test set and found that all methods, including their own, performed worse on the data from the second clinical center compared to the training set","Through Tables 2 to 5, the authors have shown that the performance of DeepMedic in terms of DSC, precision, sensitivity, ASSD, and Haussdorf for the BRATS and ISLES test datasets are worse than the performance of DeepMedic when trained with the BRATS and ISLES training datasets.","Table 3 shows the results of our method on the BRATS test data. Results of other submissions are not accessible. The decrease in performance is possibly due to the the inclusion of test images that vary significantly from the training data, such as cases acquired in clinical centers that did not provide any of the training images, something that was confirmed by the organisers. Note that performance gains obtained with the CRF are larger in this case. This indicates not only that its configuration has not overfitted to the training database but also that the CRF is robust to factors of variation between acquisition sites, which complements nicely the more sensitive CNN. For the testing phase of the challenge we formed an ensemble of three networks, coupled with the fully connected CRF. Our submission ranked first, indicating superior performance on this challenging task among 14 submissions. Table 5 shows our results, along with the other two top entries (Feng et al. (2015); Halme et al. (2015)). Among the other participating methods was the CNN of Havaei et al. (2015) with 3 layers of 2D convolutions. That method perfomed less well on this challenging task (Maier et al. (2017)). This points out the advantage offered by 3D context, the large field of view of DeepMedic thanks to multi-scale processing and the representational power of deeper networks. It is important to note the decrease of performance in comparison to the training set. All methods performed worse on the data coming from the second clinical center, including the method of Feng et al. (2015) that is not machine-learning based. This highlights a general difficulty with current approaches when applied on multi-center data. Quantitative results from the application of the DeepMedic, the CRF and an ensemble of three similar networks on the training data are presented in Table 2. The latter two offer an improvement, albeit fairly small since the performance of DeepMedic is already rather high in this task. Also shown are results from previous works, as reported on the online evaluation platform. Various settings may vary among submissions, such as the pre-processing pipeline or the number of folds used for cross-validation. Still it appears that our system performs favourably compared to previous state-of-the-art, including the semi-automatic system of Bakas et al. (2015) (bakas1) who won the latest challenge and the method of Pereira et al. (2015) (peres1), which is based on grade-specific 2D CNNs and requires visual inspection of the tumor and identification of the grade by the user prior to segmentation. Examples of segmentations obtained with our method are shown in Fig. 12. DeepMedic behaves very well in preserving the hierarchical structure of the tumor, which we account to the large context processed by our multi-scale network. The performance of our system on the training data is shown in Table 4. Significant improvement is achieved by the structural regularisation offered by the CRF, although it could be partially accounted for by overfitting the training data during the CRF’s configuration. Examples for visual inspection are shown in Fig. 13."
"The authors claims that DeepMedic  behaves very well in preserving the hierarchical structure tumours, is that true ? Have they tried it across different types of varying cases?","Yes, the authors claim that DeepMedic behaves well in preserving the hierarchical structure of tumors, and they provide examples in Fig. 12 to support this claim. However, there is no mention of the authors having tried the method across different types of varying cases","Figure 12 shows successful cases of segmentation for the hierarchy of brain tumors. As seen in Figure 12, the model understands that the sequence of layers goes from oedema to non-enhancing core to enhancing core to necrotic core, preserving the hierarchical structure of tumors. They also show a relatively unsuccessful case where oversegmentation occurs, but even in this example, the hierarchy of the tumor is preserved.","Quantitative results from the application of the DeepMedic, the CRF and an ensemble of three similar networks on the training data are presented in Table 2.

"The brain tumour segmentation data consists of 274 cases in total, is this dataset large enough to not consider adding regularisation technics ?",NO,The authors mention that they reduced the amount of regularization techniques as they consider the BRATS database to be large.,"Network configuration and training: We modify the DeepMedic architecture to handle multi-class problems by extending the classification layer to five feature maps (four tumor classes plus background). The rest of the configuration remains unchanged. We enrich the dataset with sagittal reflections. Opposite to the experiments on TBI, we do not employ the intensity perturbation and dropout on convolutional layers, because the network should not require as much regularisation with this large database. The network is trained on image segments extracted with equal probability centred on the whole tumor and healthy tissue. The distribution of the classes captured by our training scheme is provided in C."
Why did the GAN-based image editing approach succeed only on highly curated datasets and struggle over large and diverse datasets?,"The GAN-based image editing approach struggled over large and diverse datasets because it relied solely on random seeds for generating images, neglecting the importance of pixel-to-text interactions in the diffusion process","Detailed generated images using GANs depends on the initial noise vector and the interaction between pixels to text embedding. Unfortunately the reason that specifies why large and diverse datasets didn't succeed isn't mentioned in this paper, and neither the embedding size nor any related information can be exploited to complete the answer.","Real Image Editing.Editing a real image requires finding an initial noise vector that produces the given input image when fed into the diffusion process. This process, known as inversion, has recently drawn considerable attention for GANs, e.g., zhu2016generative ; abdal2019image2stylegan ; alaluf2022hyperstyle ; roich2021pivotal ; zhu2020domain ; tov2021designing ; Wang2021HighFidelityGI ; xia2021gan , but has not yet been fully addressed for text-guided diffusion models. Our key observation is that the structure and appearances of the generated image depend not only on the random seed, but also on the interaction between the pixels to the text embedding through the diffusion process. By modifying the pixel-to-text interaction that occurs in cross-attention layers, we provide Prompt-to-Prompt image editing capabilities"
How is deep spatial features of the noisy image \phi(z_t) different from noisy image z_t?,"Deep spatial features of the noisy image \phi(z_t) are different from the noisy image z_t in that they capture more abstract and hierarchical representations of the image, while the noisy image z_t represents the raw, low-level features of the image","A noisy image is the output image of a diffusion step, and the features of a noisy image can’t be answered using this paper only as it’s assumed to be a basic knowledge to the reader background in Machine Learning “And this question is repeated”.","Let DM(z_{t},\mathcal{P},t,s) be the computation of a single step t of the diffusion process, which outputs the noisy image z_{t-1}, and the attention map M_{t} (omitted if not used). We denote by DM(z_{t},\mathcal{P},t,s)\{M\leftarrow\widehat{M}\} the diffusion step where we override the attention map M with an additional given map \widehat{M}, but keep the values V from the supplied prompt. We also denote by M_{t}^{*} the produced attention map using the edited prompt \mathcal{P}^{*}.Lastly, we define Edit(M_{t},M_{t}^{*},t) to be a general edit function, receiving as input the t’th attention maps of the original and edited images during their generation."
