This interaction takes place even when intestinal barrier function is uncompromised. An increasing body of evidence suggests that bacterial membrane vesicles (bMVs), in addition to bacterial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, are able to mediate effects of the microbiota on these host tissues.

Tannic acid (TA), an organic compound in many plants, has garnered recent attention for its discernible anti-mutagenic attributes. This investigation endeavored to scrutinize the repercussions of TA on grade II bladder cancer, with a concerted focus on unraveling its anti-cancer mechanisms. The cytotoxic effects of TA on grade II bladder cancer cells were investigated using multiple techniques, including MTT assay, flow cytometry, TUNEL assay, and western blot. Our findings revealed that elevated concentrations of TA induced cytotoxic effects in grade II bladder cancer cells. Both flow cytometry and the TUNEL assay substantiated the dose-dependent capacity of TA to prompt apoptosis. Western blot analysis corroborated that TA treatment in bladder cancer cells resulted in the upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 expression and PARP. Furthermore, heightened TA dosage elicited an augmentation in the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, namely Bax and Bak, alongside a reduction in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 within bladder cancer cells. This study confirms TA as a potential anticancer agent, demonstrably diminishing the viability of bladder cancer cells. TA exerts cytotoxicity through the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. Specifically, TA initiates the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, concurrently augmenting the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins to facilitate apoptosis. Collectively, the present study indicates that TA effectively impedes the proliferation of bladder cancer cells by instigating apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.',)",1.0,0.7419697768218851,0.7256193310079679,0.6139814718826202,0.7226673909806416,0.6884751756473177

For hemp, a crop that is valued for multiple aspects, such as its medical compounds, fibre, and seed, a comprehensive understanding of its salt stress responses is a prerequisite for resistance breeding and tailoring its agronomic performance to suit certain industrial applications. Here, we first observed the phenotype of salt-stressed hemp plants and found that under NaCl treatment, hemp plants displayed pronounced growth defects, as indicated by the significantly reduced average height, number of leaves, and chlorophyll content. Next, we conducted comparative proteomics and metabolomics to dissect the complex salt-stress response mechanisms.
