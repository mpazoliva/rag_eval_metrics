      "89  Accuracy is crucial for safety but it's not only accuracy vs size relation. We should consider more aspects. For example, response time of a driving car system is very crucial for safety. Communication overhead between servers while model training increases with the size of the model so smaller models train faster. Updating models from company servers to the car or over-the-air updates based on AlexNet at that time would require 240MB of communication from the server to the car. Hence, smaller models require less communication, making frequent updates more feasible. Also, keeping in mind architectural designs such as adjusting some functionalities, introducing new ways of extracting features, or using different objectives and optimizers may make a small model achieve the same level of accuracy or even surpass the larger model; for instance, SqueezeNet is 50x smaller than AlexNet with equivalent accuracy.   \n",

The authors posit that this is due to how KERM explicitly introduces external knowledge which can improve semantic matching performance. This suggests that KERM models with other backbone models will be able to improve on the performance of their backbone models. However, the likelihood of performance improvements with other backbone models cannot be answered from this paper.   \n",

      "89  Much of the recent research on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has focused on increasing accuracy on computer vision datasets.For a given accuracy level, there typically exist multiple CNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level.Given equivalent accuracy, a CNN architecture with fewer parameters has several advantages:\\bulletMore efficient distributed training.Communication among servers is the limiting factor to the scalability of distributed CNN training.For distributed data-parallel training, communication overhead is directly proportional to the number of parameters in the model Iandola et al. (2016).In short, small models train faster due to requiring less communication.\\bulletLess overhead when exporting new models to clients. For autonomous driving, companies such as Tesla periodically copy new models from their servers to customers’ cars. This practice is often referred to as an over-the-air update. Consumer Reports has found that the safety of Tesla’s Autopilot semi-autonomous driving functionality has incrementally improved with recent over-the-air updates Consumer Reports (2016). However, over-the-air updates of today’s typical CNN/DNN models can require large data transfers. With AlexNet, this would require 240MB of communication from the server to the car. Smaller models require less communication, making frequent updates more feasible.\\bulletFeasible FPGA and embedded deployment. FPGAs often have less than 10MB111For example, the Xilinx Vertex-7 FPGA has a maximum of 8.5 MBytes (i.e. 68 Mbits) of on-chip memory and does not provide off-chip memory. of on-chip memory and no off-chip memory or storage. For inference, a sufficiently small model could be stored directly on the FPGA instead of being bottlenecked by memory bandwidth Qiu et al. (2016), while video frames stream through the FPGA in real time.Further, when deploying CNNs on Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), a sufficiently small model could be stored directly on-chip, and smaller models may enable the ASIC to fit on a smaller die.\\nSo far, we have proposed architectural design strategies for small models, followed these principles to create SqueezeNet, and discovered that SqueezeNet is 50x smaller than AlexNet with equivalent accuracy.However, SqueezeNet and other models reside in a broad and largely unexplored design space of CNN architectures.Now, in Sections 5 and 6, we explore several aspects of the design space. We divide this architectural exploration into two main topics: microarchitectural exploration (per-module layer dimensions and configurations) and macroarchitectural exploration (high-level end-to-end organization of modules and other layers).    \n",

From our analysis, we find that no single approach consistently outperforms other approaches on all datasets. Further, we notice that the in-domain performance of a model does not correlate well with its generalization capabilities: models fine-tuned with identical training data might generalize differently. In terms of efficiency, we find a trade-off between the performances and the computational cost: computationally expensive models, like re-ranking models and late interaction model perform the best. More efficient approaches e.g. based on dense or sparse embeddings can substantially underperform traditional lexical models like BM25. Overall, BM25 remains a strong baseline for zero-shot text retrieval.   \n",

All experiments are conducted under the same BM25 setting with 1000 retrieved candidates. We conduct experiments with the deep learning framework PaddlePaddle (Maet al., 2019) on up to 4 NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPUs (with 40G RAM). For the GMN module, we use Paddle Graph Learning (PGL) 222https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PGL, an efficient and flexible graph learning framework based on PaddlePaddle. For training, we used the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 1e-5 for text encoder and 1e-4 for knowledge injector. The model is trained up to 5 epochs with a batch size of 640 and 240 for base and large models respectively.In our experiments, the PLM small, base and large models have 6, 12 and 24 Transformer layers respectively.The text encoder has 9 layers and 21 layers for base and large model respectively, and the knowledge injector both has 3 layers in our experiment. The dropout rates are set to 0.1. The ratio of the positive to the hard negative is set to 1:19.All transformer layers in KERM’s backbone are initialized from ERNIE-2.0 base (Sunet al., 2020b), which is a BERT-like model pre-trained with a continual pre-training framework on multiple tasks. We perform Knowledge-enhanced pre-training on MARCO passage collection to warm up the parameters in knowledge injector, which has 60,000 iterations under the batch size of 256.For a fair comparison, the same pre-training without knowledge enhancement is also conducted on \\textrm{ERNIE}_{\\textrm{base}} re-ranker and all models in ablation studies.\\n(4) Compared with \\textrm{ERNIE}_{\\textrm{base}} we trained, \\textrm{KERM}_{\\textrm{base}} shows a significant improvement on both two query sets. This indicates the explicit introduction of external knowledge can alleviate the semantic gap and heterogeneity between query and passage, and improve the semantic matching performance.   \n",

RocketQAv1 trains dual-encoder and cross-encoder in a cascade manner, which leverages the powerful cross-encoder to empower the dual-encoder. While it inherits the parameters from RocketQAv1, RocketQAv2 extends the first version through a novel approach that jointly trains the dense passage retriever and passage re-ranker, and by using a large PLM for data augmentation and denoising (i.e.,  a distillation procedure).   \n",

Detailed analyses showthe superiority of ICL andexperiments conducted onfour datasets further demonstratethe effectiveness of the proposed method.   \n",
      "79  Existing PLMs based re-rankers typically improve ranking performance from two aspects: (1) By optimizing the ranking procedure: monoBERT (Nogueira and Cho, 2019) is the first work that re-purposed BERT as a passage re-ranker and achieves state-of-the-art results. duoBERT (Nogueiraet al., 2019a) integrates monoBERT in a multistage ranking architecture and adopts a pairwise classification approach to passage relevance computation. UED (Yanet al., 2021) proposes a cascade pre-training manner that can jointly enhance the retrieval stage through passage expansion with a pre-trained query generator and thus elevate the re-ranking stage with a pre-trained transformer encoder. The two stages can facilitate each other in a unified pre-training framework. H-ERNIE (Chuet al., 2022) proposes a multi-granularity PLM for web search.(2) By designing rational distillation procedure: LM Distill + Fine-Tuning (Gaoet al., 2020) explores a variety of distillation methods to equip a smaller re-ranker with both general-purpose language modeling knowledge learned in pre-training and search- specific relevance modeling knowledge learned in fine-tuning, and produces a faster re-ranker with better ranking performance. CAKD (Hofstätter et al., 2020) proposes a cross-architecture knowledge distillation procedure with a Margin-MSE loss, which can distill knowledge from multiple teachers at the same time. RocketQAv1 (Qu et al., 2021) trains dual-encoder and cross-encoder in a cascade manner, which leverages the powerful cross-encoder to empower the dual-encoder. RocketQAv2 (Ren et al., 2021) proposes a novel approach that jointly trains the dense passage retriever and passage re-ranker. The parameters of RocketQAv2 are inherited from RocketQAv1. Besides, RocketQAv2 utilizes a large PLM for data augmentation and denoising, which can also be regarded as a distillation procedure. Notably, these two types of studies anticipate more insightful information to be captured by the advanced ranking and training procedures, while neglecting the limitations of implicit knowledge extracted from noisy and heterogeneous data. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed the first knowledge-enhanced PLM based re-ranker, which thoughtfully leverages explicit external knowledge that improve the effectiveness of the model.\\nWe include several PLMs based re-rankers in our evaluation, including the state-of-the-art:•monoBERT (Nogueira and Cho, 2019): The first study that re-purposes BERT as a re-ranker and achieves state-of-the-art results.•duoBERT (Nogueiraet al., 2019a):This work proposes a pairwise classification approach using BERT, which obtains the ability to be more sensitive to semantics through greater computation.•UED (Yanet al., 2021): A unified pre-training framework that jointly refines re-ranker and query generator. For a fair comparison, we only use the re-ranker in UED without passage expansion.•LM Distill+Fine-Tuning (LDFT) (Gaoet al., 2020):A variety of distillation methods are compared in this paper. The experimental results indicate that a proper distillation procedure (i.e. first distill the language model, and then fine-tune on the ranking task) could produce a faster re-ranker with better ranking performance.•CAKD (Hofstätter et al., 2020): This work proposes a cross-architecture knowledge distillation procedure with Margin-MSE loss, which can distill knowledge from multiple teachers.•RocketQAv1 (Qu et al., 2021): This work mainly focuses on the training of PLM based retriever, where the re-ranker is an intermediate product of its training process.•RocketQAv2 (Ren et al., 2021): Based on RocketQAv1, this work proposes a novel approach that jointly trains the PLM based retriever and re-ranker.To compare the performance of different methods, we resort to two ranking metrics.For MSMARCO-DEV, We adopt Mean Reciprocal Rank (i.e., MRR@10).For TREC 2019 DL, we use Mean Average Precision, i.e., MAP@10 and MAP@30.For Ohsumed, both Mean Reciprocal Rank and Mean Average Precision (i.e., MRR@10 and MAP@10) are employed for comprehensive performance analysis in queries requiring in-depth domain knowledge.   \n",

      "89  Accuracy is crucial for safety but it's not only accuracy vs size relation. We should consider more aspects. For example, response time of a driving car system is very crucial for safety. Communication overhead between servers while model training increases with the size of the model so smaller models train faster. Updating models from company servers to the car or over-the-air updates based on AlexNet at that time would require 240MB of communication from the server to the car. Hence, smaller models require less communication, making frequent updates more feasible. Also, keeping in mind architectural designs such as adjusting some functionalities, introducing new ways of extracting features, or using different objectives and optimizers may make a small model achieve the same level of accuracy or even surpass the larger model; for instance, SqueezeNet is 50x smaller than AlexNet with equivalent accuracy.   \n",

      "89  Much of the recent research on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has focused on increasing accuracy on computer vision datasets.For a given accuracy level, there typically exist multiple CNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level.Given equivalent accuracy, a CNN architecture with fewer parameters has several advantages:\\bulletMore efficient distributed training.Communication among servers is the limiting factor to the scalability of distributed CNN training.For distributed data-parallel training, communication overhead is directly proportional to the number of parameters in the model Iandola et al. (2016).In short, small models train faster due to requiring less communication.\\bulletLess overhead when exporting new models to clients. For autonomous driving, companies such as Tesla periodically copy new models from their servers to customers’ cars. This practice is often referred to as an over-the-air update. Consumer Reports has found that the safety of Tesla’s Autopilot semi-autonomous driving functionality has incrementally improved with recent over-the-air updates Consumer Reports (2016). However, over-the-air updates of today’s typical CNN/DNN models can require large data transfers. With AlexNet, this would require 240MB of communication from the server to the car. Smaller models require less communication, making frequent updates more feasible.\\bulletFeasible FPGA and embedded deployment. FPGAs often have less than 10MB111For example, the Xilinx Vertex-7 FPGA has a maximum of 8.5 MBytes (i.e. 68 Mbits) of on-chip memory and does not provide off-chip memory. of on-chip memory and no off-chip memory or storage. For inference, a sufficiently small model could be stored directly on the FPGA instead of being bottlenecked by memory bandwidth Qiu et al. (2016), while video frames stream through the FPGA in real time.Further, when deploying CNNs on Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), a sufficiently small model could be stored directly on-chip, and smaller models may enable the ASIC to fit on a smaller die.\\nSo far, we have proposed architectural design strategies for small models, followed these principles to create SqueezeNet, and discovered that SqueezeNet is 50x smaller than AlexNet with equivalent accuracy.However, SqueezeNet and other models reside in a broad and largely unexplored design space of CNN architectures.Now, in Sections 5 and 6, we explore several aspects of the design space. We divide this architectural exploration into two main topics: microarchitectural exploration (per-module layer dimensions and configurations) and macroarchitectural exploration (high-level end-to-end organization of modules and other layers).    \n",

Further, we notice that the in-domain performance of a model does not correlate well with its generalization capabilities: models fine-tuned with identical training data might generalize differently. In terms of efficiency, we find a trade-off between the performances and the computational cost: computationally expensive models, like re-ranking models and late interaction model perform the best. More efficient approaches e.g. based on dense or sparse embeddings can substantially underperform traditional lexical models like BM25. Overall, BM25 remains a strong baseline for zero-shot text retrieval.   \n",

In particular, we find the maximum cosine similarity of each v\\in E_{q} with vectors in E_{d}, and combine the outputs via summation. Besides cosine, we also evaluate squared L2 distance as a measure of vector similarity. Intuitively, this interaction mechanism softly searches for each query term t_{q}—in a manner that reflects its context in the query—against the document’s embeddings, quantifying the strength of the “match” via the largest similarity score between t_{q} and a document term t_{d}. Given these term scores, it then estimates the document relevance by summing the matching evidence across all query terms.\\nGiven the representation of a query q and a document d, the relevance score of d to q, denoted as S_{q,d}, is estimated via late interaction between their bags of contextualized embeddings. As mentioned before, this is conducted as a sum of maximum similarity computations, namely cosine similarity (implemented as dot-products due to the embedding normalization) or squared L2 distance.   \n",

RocketQAv1 trains dual-encoder and cross-encoder in a cascade manner, which leverages the powerful cross-encoder to empower the dual-encoder. While it inherits the parameters from RocketQAv1, RocketQAv2 extends the first version through a novel approach that jointly trains the dense passage retriever and passage re-ranker, and by using a large PLM for data augmentation and denoising (i.e.,  a distillation procedure).   \n",

Detailed analyses showthe superiority of ICL andexperiments conducted onfour datasets further demonstratethe effectiveness of the proposed method.   \n",
      "79  Existing PLMs based re-rankers typically improve ranking performance from two aspects: (1) By optimizing the ranking procedure: monoBERT (Nogueira and Cho, 2019) is the first work that re-purposed BERT as a passage re-ranker and achieves state-of-the-art results. duoBERT (Nogueiraet al., 2019a) integrates monoBERT in a multistage ranking architecture and adopts a pairwise classification approach to passage relevance computation. UED (Yanet al., 2021) proposes a cascade pre-training manner that can jointly enhance the retrieval stage through passage expansion with a pre-trained query generator and thus elevate the re-ranking stage with a pre-trained transformer encoder. The two stages can facilitate each other in a unified pre-training framework. H-ERNIE (Chuet al., 2022) proposes a multi-granularity PLM for web search.(2) By designing rational distillation procedure: LM Distill + Fine-Tuning (Gaoet al., 2020) explores a variety of distillation methods to equip a smaller re-ranker with both general-purpose language modeling knowledge learned in pre-training and search- specific relevance modeling knowledge learned in fine-tuning, and produces a faster re-ranker with better ranking performance. CAKD (Hofstätter et al., 2020) proposes a cross-architecture knowledge distillation procedure with a Margin-MSE loss, which can distill knowledge from multiple teachers at the same time. RocketQAv1 (Qu et al., 2021) trains dual-encoder and cross-encoder in a cascade manner, which leverages the powerful cross-encoder to empower the dual-encoder. RocketQAv2 (Ren et al., 2021) proposes a novel approach that jointly trains the dense passage retriever and passage re-ranker. The parameters of RocketQAv2 are inherited from RocketQAv1. Besides, RocketQAv2 utilizes a large PLM for data augmentation and denoising, which can also be regarded as a distillation procedure. Notably, these two types of studies anticipate more insightful information to be captured by the advanced ranking and training procedures, while neglecting the limitations of implicit knowledge extracted from noisy and heterogeneous data. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed the first knowledge-enhanced PLM based re-ranker, which thoughtfully leverages explicit external knowledge that improve the effectiveness of the model.\\nWe include several PLMs based re-rankers in our evaluation, including the state-of-the-art:•monoBERT (Nogueira and Cho, 2019): The first study that re-purposes BERT as a re-ranker and achieves state-of-the-art results.•duoBERT (Nogueiraet al., 2019a):This work proposes a pairwise classification approach using BERT, which obtains the ability to be more sensitive to semantics through greater computation.•UED (Yanet al., 2021): A unified pre-training framework that jointly refines re-ranker and query generator. For a fair comparison, we only use the re-ranker in UED without passage expansion.•LM Distill+Fine-Tuning (LDFT) (Gaoet al., 2020):A variety of distillation methods are compared in this paper. The experimental results indicate that a proper distillation procedure (i.e. first distill the language model, and then fine-tune on the ranking task) could produce a faster re-ranker with better ranking performance.•CAKD (Hofstätter et al., 2020): This work proposes a cross-architecture knowledge distillation procedure with Margin-MSE loss, which can distill knowledge from multiple teachers.•RocketQAv1 (Qu et al., 2021): This work mainly focuses on the training of PLM based retriever, where the re-ranker is an intermediate product of its training process.•RocketQAv2 (Ren et al., 2021): Based on RocketQAv1, this work proposes a novel approach that jointly trains the PLM based retriever and re-ranker.To compare the performance of different methods, we resort to two ranking metrics.For MSMARCO-DEV, We adopt Mean Reciprocal Rank (i.e., MRR@10).For TREC 2019 DL, we use Mean Average Precision, i.e., MAP@10 and MAP@30.For Ohsumed, both Mean Reciprocal Rank and Mean Average Precision (i.e., MRR@10 and MAP@10) are employed for comprehensive performance analysis in queries requiring in-depth domain knowledge.   \n",
