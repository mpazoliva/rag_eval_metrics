"Key signature may be helpful to constrain harmonic context. Then, wouldn't it be more valid to conduct an ablation study on chord coherence rather than harmonic similarity?","Not necessarily. While chord coherence is an important aspect of harmonic structure, it is not the only factor that is affected by the presence of key signature information. Harmonic similarity, which is measured by the similarity between the ground truth and generated chords, is also influenced by the presence of key signature information. By comparing the results of the ablation study with and without key signature information, we can determine the specific impact of key signature information on both chord coherence and harmonic similarity",It is valid enough to conduct an ablation study on harmonic similarity because constraining the harmonic context fundamentally aims to improve the chord structuredness and reconstruction performance. Constraining the harmonic context with the key signature can help the model specify the latent space and increase the probability to generate the right chord sequence that is close to the human-composed data which is well-structured.,"We conduct an ablation study to verify the beneﬁt of adding the conditional token c to VTHarm and rVTHarm. We assume that c provides key signature information that can efﬁciently constrain the latent space to a concrete harmonic context, improving the chord structuredness and reconstruction per- formance of the model. We compute the chord similarity metrics between the ground truth and generated chords from the VT models according to the presence of c . The results are demonstrated in Table 7. This table shows that the VT models without c mostly obtain worse scores for all similarity metrics than the models with c . This indicates that adding key signature information to the VT models in most cases not only enhances the one-by-one accuracy but also improves the structure of the generated chords to be more human-like. The proposed architecture of VTHarm is inspired by [22]. VTHarm has an additional probabilistic encoder for a latent variable z, where z represents the global attribute of the aggregated melody and chords. We denote this encoder as"
What would be an example of the methods that explore the effect of melody awareness?,"The methods that explore the effect of melody awareness include computing Pearson's correlation coefficient of U with C or P scores, as shown in Table 6",The method for exploring the effect of melody awareness can be one that deeply investigates how the awareness of the melody can affect the unexpectedness of the controlled chords and how this unexpectedness affects the perceived complexity and preference of the chords.,"When the melody is unaware, BLSTM and rVTHarm obtain signiﬁcantly lower Preference scores than when the melody is aware ( p < 0 . 001). We further compute Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient of U with C or P scores, as shown in Table 6. As a result, rVTHarm reveals the most nega- tive correlation of U with both C and P scores when the melody is aware. This indicates that 1) controlled chords are more unexpected and unpleasant with a familiar melody, and 2) some factors other than complexity seem to cause an increased unexpectedness in rVTHarm. However, the mean preference score of rVTHarm signiﬁcantly increases with melody awareness. This implies that the familiarity of the melody may strongly compensate for the high unexpect- edness of rVTHarm. This tendency needs further investi- gation to improve the robustness of controllable melody harmonization."
"What are some examples of ""explicit planning""?",Explicit planning examples include controlling tempo or timing with a latent representation and elastically choosing various strategies to highlight multiple nuances or emotions in piano performances,"An example of ""explicit planning"" would be the plan or strategy of abruptly increasing dynamics for performing a climax within the music to highlight a certain emotion such as anger.","However, these studies have constrained musical creativity. Maezawa et al. controlled musical expression only through quantized features from the musical scores. Tan et al. did not consider controlling tempo or timing with a latent representation. These methods may have restricted any potential for rendering piano performances with flexible musical expression. Musical creativity can be expanded not only by composers but also by performers who can elastically choose various strategies to highlight multiple nuances or emotions [13, 14, 15]. Moreover, the music generation field can be also broadened if static music created by automatic composition systems can be easily colored with realistic and elastic expression [16]."
What is the difference between IsTopVoice and PositionInChord?,"IsTopVoice is a binary attribute of whether the note is the uppermost voice, while PositionInChord is a 11-class attribute of a positional index of a note within its chord",IsTopVoice is different from PositionInChord in that an index 1 of IsTopVoice represents the uppermost voice while that of PositionInChord represents the lowermost voice. They are also different that IsTopVoice is binary while PositionInChord is multi-class.,"Score Features. The features for a musical score represent eight categorical attributes for how the notes are composed:Pitch is a MIDI index number that ranges from 21 to 108.RelDuration and RelIOI are 11-class attributes of a quantized duration and IOI between a note onset and a previous chord, respectively. They range from 1 to 11, and each class represents a multiple of a 16th note’s length with respect to a given tempo [30, 31].IsTopVoice is a binary attribute of whether the note is the uppermost voice. It is heuristically computed regarding pitches and durations of surrounding notes.PositionInChord and NumInChord are 11-class attributes of a positional index of a note within its chord and the total number of notes in that chord, respectively, that range from 1 to 11. An index 1 for PositionInChord denotes the most bottom position.Staff is a binary attribute of the staff of a note, either of the G clef or F clef.IsDownbeat is a binary attribute of whether a note is at a downbeat or not."
"Why didn't the authors intend a ""chord"" to represent a more meaningful unit in music, such as a beat?","The authors did not intend for a ""chord"" to represent a more meaningful unit in music, such as a beat, because they aimed to model the polyphonic structure of piano performance at a more granular level, focusing on the simultaneous notes that make up a chord, rather than the larger rhythmic units of beats","The authors intend a ""chord"" to represent simultaneous notes to intuitively models a polyphonic structure of piano performance that is defined by its temporal progression. More fine-grained resolution than the beat-based resolution can reflect trivial changes in expression that varies by simultaneous note groups, such as a syncopation.","We employ a self-supervised learning framework to force the latent representations to learn our target attributes [25, 26, 24].In addition, we facilitate independent control of the three expressive attributes–dynamics, articulation, and tempo–by utilizing an existing method that aligns the latent code with a target attribute [27, 28]. Finally, we design a novel mechanism that intuitively models a polyphonic structure of piano performance. In particular, we insert intermediate steps for chordwise encoding and decoding of the piano performance to our encoder-decoder architecture, where a chord denotes a group of simultaneous notes. Our approach has several contributions as follows:1) Our system aims to control musical expression while maintaining any characteristics induced by a given musical structure;2) We use self-supervised learning where new supervisory signals are involved in regularizing the latent representations effectively;3) Our system aims to control multiple expressive attributes independently of each other;4) Lastly, we leverage an intermediate step that projects a notewise representation into the chordwise in the middle of our system to intuitively model the polyphonic structure of piano performance. Inspired by previous studies [4, 8, 9, 32], we build a twostep encoder and decoder: An encoder models both notewise and chordwise dependencies of the inputs, and a decoder reconstructs the notewise dependency from the chordwise representation and the notewise condition. We denote a chord as a group of notes that are hit simultaneously, regardless of the staff, so that they sound together at an instant time [33]. Thus, learning the chordwise dependency is analogous to direct modeling of the temporal progression of the piano performance. Let M 2 RC N be a matrix that aligns serialized notes to their polyphonic structure, where C and N are the number of chords and the number of notes, respectively. Within the encoder, the"
Is there no temporal dependency between the latent variable for explicit planning?,Yes,The latent variable for explicit planning has no temporal dependency. The latent variable is derived from the standard normal distribution without the dependency on the score features.,"Inference. A probabilistic encoder parameterized by \phi approximates the posterior distibutions of the latent representations z^{(\text{pln})} and z^{(\text{str})} from the performance input x and conditional score input y:\displaystyle q_{\phi}(z^{(\text{pln})},z^{(\text{str})}|x,y)=\displaystyle q_{\phi}(z^{(\text{pln})}|x^{(\text{chd})})(3)\displaystyle\prod_{c=1}^{C}q_{\phi}(z^{(\text{str})}_{c}|x^{(\text{chd})}_{\leq c},y^{(\text{chd})}_{\leq c})where x^{(\text{chd})}=\text{N2C}(e_{x}) is the chordwise embedding, and e_{x} is the notewise embedding for x. The posterior distributions of z^{(\text{pln})}_{c} and z^{(\text{str})}_{c} are approximated by distribution parameters encoded by f^{(\text{pln})}(x^{(\text{chd})}) and f^{(\text{str})}(x^{(\text{chd})},y^{(\text{chd})}), where f^{(\text{pln})} and f^{(\text{str})} are bidirectional and unidirectional recurrent neural networks, respectively.We note that z^{(\text{pln})} is independent of the score features y. This allows a flexible transfer of the explicit planning among other musical pieces. On the other hand, z^{(\text{str})} is constrained by y since the structural attributes are dependent on the note structure. Our system can render new piano performances from the scratch given a musical score. It can directly generate expressive parameters from the randomly sampled \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})}\sim p_{\theta}(z^{(\text{pln})}) and \tilde{z}^{(\text{str})}\sim p_{\theta}(z^{(\text{str})}). We note that \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})} does not have temporal dependency: each \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})}_{c} is sampled independently of \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})}_{c-1}. Hence, we need to insert specific values \{\alpha^{(c)}\}_{c=1}^{C}, which we call as ""smooth sketches"", into the target dimensions of z^{(\text{pln})} if any temporal dependency of explicit planning is necessary. Figure 2 shows that the controlled parameters are greatly correlated with \alpha, while their local characteristics follow those of the ground truth. In addition, the black and orange lines together demonstrate granular variety in the parameters induced by different \tilde{z}^{(\text{str})} for the same musical structure. Moreover, Figure 3 shows that our system can estimate explicit planning from arbitrary human performances, indicating that our system can derive relevant information on explicit planning from the unseen data. where y(chd) = N2C(ey) is the chordwise embedding, and ey is the notewise embedding for y. We assume that the prior of z(pln) c is a standard normal distribution. In contrast, z(str) c is sampled from a sequential prior [24, 36, 37], conditioned on both previous latent variables and chordwise score features: z(str) c   N( (prior); diag( (prior)2), where [ (prior);  (prior)] = f(prior)(z(str)"
Why did the authors use a polynomial function to extract explicit planning of the performance data?,To capture the smooth and continuous nature of expressive parameters,"The authors use a polynomial function to extract explicit planning as explicit planning is defined to be a high-level sketch that the performer draws as the bigger plan of progressing musical expression throughout the piece. Such a sketch is assumed to be ""smoothed"" since it would derive from human thought that memorizes or imagines musical expression that can be also represented as an aural form by  ""singing out"" the musical progression.","Prediction Tasks. We extract new supervisory signals for additional prediction tasks from the input data [24]. We define a signal of explicit planning I^{(\text{pln})} as a set of smoothed contours of the expressive parameters. It is extracted as a polynomial function predicted from the chordwise performance parameters k. We also derive a signal of structural attribute as I^{(\text{str})}=\text{sign}(k-I^{(\text{pln})}) which represents normalized directions of the performance parameters.We train two discriminators D^{(\text{pln})} and D^{(\text{str})} that directly receive z^{(\text{pln})} and z^{(\text{str})}, respectively. D^{(\text{pln})} is composed of A sub-discriminators where each discriminator D^{(\text{pln})}_{a} predicts a signal I^{(\text{pln})}_{a} for each expressive attribute a from z^{(\text{pln})}_{a}\in\mathbb{R}^{C\times(d^{(\text{pln})}/A)}, where z^{(\text{pln})}_{a} is a constituent part of z^{(\text{pln})}, and A is the number of expressive attributes. This setting is for a clear disentanglement among the expressive attributes. On the other hand, D^{(\text{str})} predicts the signal I^{(\text{str})} at once for all expressive attributes that belong to the same musical structure. All discriminators are jointly trained with the generative model, and the costs \mathcal{L}_{\text{pln}} and \mathcal{L}_{\text{str}} are minimized as \mathcal{L}_{\text{pln}}=\frac{1}{A}\sum_{a}\text{MSE}(D^{(\text{pln})}_{a}(z^{(\text{pln})}_{a}),I^{(\text{pln})}_{a}) and \mathcal{L}_{\text{str}}=\text{MSE}(D^{(\text{str})}(z^{(\text{str})}),I^{(\text{str})}), respectively. Therefore, we attempt a new approach that renders piano performances with flexible musical expressions. We disregard a typical assumption from previous studies that a performer must follow a composer’s intent [17, 18, 19, 4]. According to the literature, performers learn to identify or imitate ""expressive models"", or explicit planning, of existing piano performances [20]. We focus on this attribute, defining it as a higher-level sketch of the expressive attributes (i.e. dynamics, articulation, and tempo [21]) that the performer draws based on a personal interpretation of the musical piece [20, 4, 11]. We also assume that the remaining attribute represents common performing strategies that are connected to certain musical patterns, while these strategies slightly differ across performers [22, 23]. We call this attribute as a structural attribute that belongs to given note structures of a musical piece."
Why did the authors use only one composer rather than several composers together?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

To ensure representativeness of the training data.

The authors chose to use only one composer (Chopin) for their training data to ensure that the model is exposed to a representative range of Western musical expression, as Chopin's works are considered to be a benchmark for Western classical music. By using a single composer, the authors could ensure that the model is trained on a consistent style and aesthetic, which would make it more difficult to generalize to other composers and styles","The authors use only one composer, Chopin, rather than several composers together because Chopin's music has been one of the most common resources that are analyzed by literature to investigate the development in Western musical expression with respect to various musical structures. In other words, modeling music only from Chopin is assumed to be enough for learning Western musical expression derived from various musical patterns.","We use Yamaha e-Competition Dataset [8] and Vienna 4x22 Piano Corpus [40]. From these datasets, we collect 356 performances of 34 pieces by Frédéric Chopin, which have been representative research subjects for analyzing the Western musical expression [22, 41, 6, 42]. We use 30 pieces (108,738 batches) for training and the rest for testing. To verify the generality of model performances, we also collect the external dataset from ASAP dataset [43]. We use 116 performances for 23 pieces by 10 composers who represent various eras of Western music. For subjective evaluation, we collect 42 songs of non-Classical songs from online source222http://www.ambrosepianotabs.com/page/library which are less constrained to written expression than most Classical excerpts."
Why didn't the authors use the previous studies mentioned in the Introduction section as baseline models?,"The authors did not use previous studies as baseline models because they wanted to focus on flexible musical expressions and personal interpretation, rather than following a composer's intent or imitating existing performances",The authors did not use the previous studies as the baseline models since the proposed work attempts a new approach that disregards a typical assumption from the previous studies. There has been no identical assumption in the previous studies that musical expression can vary regardless of the written expression provided by the composers.,"Therefore, we attempt a new approach that renders piano performances with flexible musical expressions. We disregard a typical assumption from previous studies that a performer must follow a composer’s intent [4, 17–19].

What is the reason for using the reconstruction metric calculated from zero explicit planning?,To measure the structural attribute,"The reconstruction metric that measures the performance for predicting the structure attribute is calculated from zero explicit planning. The reason is that using a flat expression derived by the zero explicit planning can let the generated structural attribute be solely exposed, not mixed with any musical expression.","We verify whether the latent representations are well-disentangled by appropriate information[24]. To this end, each model infers the latent representations z^{(\text{pln})} and z^{(\text{str})} from the test sets. Each model also randomly samples \tilde{z}^{(\text{str})} and infers z^{(\text{pln})}_{0}\sim q_{\phi}(z^{(\text{pln})}|x_{0}). We use z^{(\text{pln})}_{0} to measure the structural attribute, since z^{(\text{pln})}_{0} represents a flat expression where the structural attribute can be solely exposed. Each model generates new outputs as x^{(\text{pln})}\sim p_{\theta}(x^{(\text{pln})}|z^{(\text{pln})},\tilde{z}^{(\text{str})},y) and x^{(\text{str})}\sim p_{\theta}(x^{(\text{str})}|z^{(\text{pln})}_{0},z^{(\text{str})},y). Then, we compute a new signal \tilde{I}^{(\text{pln})} from x^{(\text{pln})} using the polynomial regression. The MSE values are calculated as \text{MSE}_{\text{p}}=\text{MSE}(\tilde{I}^{(\text{pln})},I^{(\text{pln})}) and \text{MSE}_{\text{s}}=\text{MSE}(x^{(\text{str})},k-I^{(\text{pln})})."
"Why did the authors use the randomly sampled z(str) to measure explicit planning, while using z(pln) from zero explicit planning to measure structural attributes?","To isolate the effect of explicit planning on the generated outputs. By using randomly sampled z(str) to measure explicit planning, the authors can control for the influence of the structural attributes on the generated outputs, allowing them to isolate the effect of explicit planning on the outputs.

"Why didn't the authors try the listening test for the samples from non-zero, realistic explicit planning, like other performance rendering studies?","The authors did not try the listening test for samples from non-zero, realistic explicit planning because they wanted to evaluate the base quality of the samples without any preference for arbitrary explicit planning.

Such realistic explicit planning should be inserted by the user, or inferred from the posterior distribution with respect to the ground truth data, maybe Classical music with various musical expressions, but the existing expressions can be already constrained by the written guidelines. The written expression can be a strong bias to the listeners so that the new expression against the original expression can be perceived as awkward regardless of how natural the expression itself is.","We conduct a listening test to compare the proposed model architecture to Notewise and CVAE. We qualitatively evaluate the base quality of the samples that have flat expressions, so that quality judgments are independent of any preference of arbitrary explicit planning. We generate each sample using z^{(\text{pln})}_{0}. A listening test is composed of 30 trials where each participant chooses a more ""human-like"" sample out of the generated sample and its plain MIDI [9]. Both samples have the same length which is a maximum of 15 seconds, rendered with TiMidity++333https://sourceforge.net/projects/timidity/ without any pedal effect.

Why does negative transfer occur when learning with auxiliary tasks? ,"Negative transfer occurs when learning with auxiliary tasks because the model trained on the auxiliary tasks may not be well-suited for the primary task, leading to poor performance on the primary task. This can happen when the auxiliary tasks and the primary task have different characteristics, such as different distributions or different types of relationships between features and labels. When the model is trained on the auxiliary tasks, it may learn to recognize patterns that are not relevant to the primary task, leading to negative transfer","Negative transfer happens when the learning of an auxiliary task negatively impacts the performance of the primary task. In the case of graph-based tasks, it can happen because the graph structure, such as the number of nodes, edges, and diameter, can be vastly different between domains. This causes confusion for the model, resulting in poor generalization of the primary task.","Pre-training with an auxiliary task is a common technique for deep neural networks.Indeed, it is the de facto standard step in natural language processing and computer vision to learn a powerful backbone networks such as BERT devlin2018bert  and ResNet he2016deep  leveraging large datasets such as BooksCorpus zhu2015aligning , English Wikipedia, and ImageNet deng2009imagenet .The models trained on the auxiliary task are often beneficial for the primary (target) task of interest.Despite the success of pre-training, few approaches have been generalized to graph-structured data due to their fundamental challenges.First, graph structure (e.g., the number of nodes/edges, and diameter) and its meaning can significantly differ between domains. So the model trained on an auxiliary task can harm generalization on the primary task, i.e., negative transfer pan2009survey .Also, many graph neural networks are transductive approaches. This often makes transfer learning between datasets inherently infeasible.So, pre-training on the target dataset has been proposed using auxiliary tasks: graph kernel  navarin2018pre , graph reconstruction zhang2020graph , and attribute masking  hu2020strategies . These assume that the auxiliary tasks for pre-training are carefully selected with substantial domain knowledge and expertise in graph characteristics to assist the primary task.Since most graph neural networks operate on homogeneous graphs, which have a single type of nodes and edges, the previous pre-training/auxiliary tasksare not specifically designed for heterogeneous graphs, which have multiple types of nodes and edges.Heterogeneous graphs commonly occur in real-world applications, for instance, a music dataset has multiple types of nodes (e.g., user, song, artist) and multiple types of relations (e.g., user-artist, song-film, song-instrument). Our framework SELAR is learning to learn a primary task with multiple auxiliary tasks to assist the primary task.This can be formally written asmin𝐰,Θ⁡𝔼⁢[ℒp⁢r⁢(𝐰∗⁢(Θ))](x,y)∼Dp⁢r⁢ s.t. ⁢𝐰∗⁢(Θ)=arg⁡min𝐰⁡𝔼⁢[ℒp⁢r+a⁢u⁢(𝐰;Θ)](x,y)∼Dp⁢r+a⁢u,\displaystyle\min_{\mathbf{w},\Theta}\;\;\underset{(x,y)\sim D^{pr}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;}{\text{\large$\mathbb{E}$}\;\;\left[\;\;\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta))\;\;\right]}\;\;\text{ s.t. }\;\;\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)=\operatorname*{\arg\!\min}_{\mathbf{w}}\underset{(x,y)\sim D^{pr+au}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;}{\;\;\mathbb{E}\;\;\left[\;\;\mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w};\Theta)\;\;\right]},roman_min start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_w , roman_Θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_UNDERACCENT ( italic_x , italic_y ) ∼ italic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_UNDERACCENT start_ARG blackboard_E [ caligraphic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( bold_w start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_Θ ) ) ] end_ARG s.t. bold_w start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_Θ ) = start_OPERATOR roman_arg roman_min end_OPERATOR start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_w end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_UNDERACCENT ( italic_x , italic_y ) ∼ italic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r + italic_a italic_u end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_UNDERACCENT start_ARG blackboard_E [ caligraphic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r + italic_a italic_u end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( bold_w ; roman_Θ ) ] end_ARG ,(2)where \mathcal{L}^{pr}(\cdot) is the primary task loss function to evaluate the trained model f(x;\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)) on meta-data (a validation for meta-learning han2018coteaching ) D^{pr} and \mathcal{L}^{pr+au} is the loss function to train a model on training data D^{pr+au} with the primary and auxiliary tasks. To avoid cluttered notation, f, x, and y are omitted. Each task \mathcal{T}_{t} has N_{t} samples and \mathcal{T}_{0} and \{\mathcal{T}_{t}\}_{t=1}^{T} denote the primary and auxiliary tasks respectively.The proposed formulation in Eq. (2) learns how to assist the primary task by optimizing \Theta via meta-learning. The nested optimization problem given \Theta is a regular training with properly adjusted loss functions to balance the primary and auxiliary tasks. The formulation can be more specifically written as\displaystyle\min_{\mathbf{w},\Theta}∑i=1M01M0ℓ0(yi(0,m⁢e⁢t⁢a),f(xi(0,m⁢e⁢t⁢a);𝐰∗(Θ))\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{M_{0}}\frac{1}{M_{0}}\ell^{0}(y_{i}^{(0,meta)},f(x_{i}^{(0,meta)};\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta))∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG roman_ℓ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( 0 , italic_m italic_e italic_t italic_a ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_f ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( 0 , italic_m italic_e italic_t italic_a ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ; bold_w start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_Θ ) )(3)s.t.\displaystyle\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)=\operatorname*{\arg\!\min}_{\mathbf{w}}\sum_{t=0}^{T}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}}\frac{1}{N_{t}}\mathcal{V}(\xi^{(t,train)}_{i};\Theta)\ell^{t}(y_{i}^{(t,train)},f^{t}(x_{i}^{(t,train)};\mathbf{w})),(4)where \ell^{t} and f^{t} denote the loss function and the model for task t. We overload \ell^{t} with its function value, i.e., \ell^{t}=\ell^{t}(y_{i}^{(t,train)},f^{t}(x_{i}^{(t,train)};\mathbf{w})). \xi^{(t,train)}_{i} is the embedding vector of i_{th} sample for task t. It is the concatenation of one-hot representation of task types, the label of the sample (positive/negative), and its loss value, i.e., \xi^{(t,train)}_{i}=\left[\ell^{t};e_{t};y_{i}^{(t,train)}\right]\in\textbf{R}^{T+2}.To derive our learning algorithm,we first shorten the objective function in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) as \mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)) and \mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w};\Theta).This is equivalent to Eq. (2) without expectation.Then, our formulation is given as\min_{\mathbf{w},\Theta}\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta))\;\;\text{ s.t. }\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)=\operatorname*{\arg\!\min}_{\mathbf{w}}\mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w};\Theta),(5)To circumvent the difficulty of the bi-level optimization, as previous works MAML ; han2018coteaching  in meta-learning we approximate it with the updated parameters \hat{\mathbf{w}} using the gradient descent update as\displaystyle\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)\approx\hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k}(\Theta^{k})=\mathbf{w}^{k}-\alpha\nabla_{\mathbf{w}}\mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w}^{k};\Theta^{k}),(6)where \alpha is the learning rate for \mathbf{w}.We do not numerically evaluate \hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k}(\Theta) instead we plug the computational graph of \hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k} in \mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)) to optimize \Theta.Let \nabla_{\Theta}\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta^{k})) be the gradient evaluated at \Theta^{k}.Then updating parameters \Theta is given as\displaystyle\Theta^{k+1}=\Theta^{k}-\beta\nabla_{\Theta}\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k}(\Theta^{k})),(7)where \beta is the learning rate for \Theta. This update allows softly selecting useful auxiliary tasks (meta-paths) and balance them with the primary task to improve the performance of the primary task. Without balancing tasks with the weighting function \mathcal{V}(\cdot;\Theta), auxiliary tasks can dominate training and degrade the performance of the primary task."
How did the authors design the meta-path prediction task? ,"The authors designed the meta-path prediction task by defining a binary label for each meta-path in the heterogeneous graph, where a label of 1 indicates that the meta-path is present in the graph, and 0 otherwise","The authors designed the meta-path prediction task as a variation of link prediction. In meta-path prediction, instead of just predicting links between two nodes, the task is to predict the presence of a specific sequence of heterogeneous composite relations, called a meta-path. The prediction is done in the same way as link prediction, by assigning a binary label (1 or 0) to indicate whether the two nodes are connected by the meta-path. The labels for the task can be generated automatically from the heterogeneous graph, by calculating the product of the adjacency matrices of the edge types in the meta-path.","Meta-path prediction is similar to link prediction but meta-paths allow heterogeneous composite relations.The meta-path prediction can be achieved in the same manner as link prediction.If two nodes u and v are connected by a meta-path p with the heterogeneous edges (t_{1},t_{2},\ldots t_{\ell}), then y_{u,v}^{p}=1, otherwise y_{u,v}^{p}=0. The labels can be generated from a heterogeneous graph without any manual labeling.They can be obtained by A_{p}=A_{t_{l}}\ldots A_{t_{2}}A_{t_{1}}, where A_{t} is the adjacency matrix of edge type t. The binarized value at (u,v) in A_{p} indicates whether u and v are connected with the meta-path p.In this paper, we use meta-path prediction as a self-supervised auxiliary task. Meta-Path [46, 49] is a path on a heterogeneous graph G that a sequence of nodes connected with heterogeneous edges, i.e., v1 t1 −→ v2 t2 −→ . . . tl −→ vl+1, where tl ∈ T e denotes an l-th edge type of the meta-path. The meta-path can be viewed as a composite relation R = t1 ◦ t2 . . . ◦ tl between node v1 and vl+1, where R1 ◦ R2 denotes the composition of relation R1 and R2. The definition of meta-path generalizes multi-hop connections and is shown to be useful to analyze heterogeneous graphs. For instance, in Book-Crossing dataset, ‘user-item-written.series-item-user’ indicates that a meta-path that connects users who like the same book series."
What do challenging auxiliary tasks mean?,"Challenging auxiliary tasks refer to the difficulty in learning long-range relations across heterogeneous nodes in meta-path prediction, particularly when mini-batch training is inevitable due to the size of datasets or models, and the limited receptive field of small learner networks","Challenging auxiliary tasks refer to tasks that are difficult for the model to learn, which can negatively impact the performance of the primary task. In the case of meta-path prediction, it is considered more challenging than link prediction and node classification because it requires the understanding of long-range relations across heterogeneous nodes. The task becomes even more difficult when mini-batch training is necessary due to the large size of datasets or models, as important nodes and edges for meta-paths may not be available within a mini-batch.","Meta-path prediction is generally more challenging than link prediction and node classification since it requires the understanding of long-range relations across heterogeneous nodes. The meta-path prediction gets more difficult when mini-batch training is inevitable due to the size of datasets or models. Within a mini-batch, important nodes and edges for meta-paths are not available. Also, a small learner network, e.g., two-layer GNNs, with a limited receptive field, inherently cannot capture long-range relations. The challenges can hinder representation learning and damage the generalization of the primary task. We proposed a Hint Network (HintNet) which makes the challenge tasks more solvable by correcting the answer with more information at the learner’s need.

 How can Hint Network help with challenging auxiliary tasks?,"Hint Network can help with challenging auxiliary tasks by correcting the learner's answer with more information, providing more solvable challenge tasks and improving representation learning","The HintNet is designed to make challenging tasks more solvable by providing the model with additional information at the point of need, specifically by correcting the answer of the learner with its own answer from an augmented graph with hub nodes.

What is a meta-path? Please explain with examples.,"A meta-path is a sequence of nodes connected by heterogeneous edges, representing a composite relation between the nodes.

Examples:

1. In the Book-Crossing dataset, 'user-item-written.series-item-user' is a meta-path that connects users who like the same book series.
2. In a social network, 'person-organization-event-person' is a meta-path that connects people who attend the same event through an organization.

In both examples, the meta-path represents a long-range connection between nodes of different types, allowing for the analysis of complex relationships in heterogeneous graphs","A meta-path is a sequence of node types and edge types in a graph that describes a specific type of relationship between nodes. An example is in a recommendation system, a meta-path could be ""user-item-written.series-item-user"" which describes a relationship between users who like the same book series.","Meta-Path HAN ; sun2011pathsim  is a path on a heterogeneous graph G that a sequence of nodes connected with heterogeneous edges, i.e., {v}_{1}\xrightarrow{t_{1}}{v}_{2}\xrightarrow{t_{2}}\ldots\xrightarrow{t_{l}}{v}_{l+1},where t_{l}\in\mathcal{T}^{e} denotes an l-th edge type of the meta-path.The meta-path can be viewed as a composite relation R=t_{1}\circ t_{2}\ldots\circ t_{l} between node {v}_{1} and {v}_{l+1}, where R_{1}\circ R_{2} denotes the composition of relation R_{1} and R_{2}.The definition of meta-path generalizes multi-hop connections and is shown to be useful to analyze heterogeneous graphs.For instance, in Book-Crossing dataset, ‘user-item-written.series-item-user’ indicates that a meta-path that connects users who like the same book series.

What is the role of meta-data in the proposed method?,"The meta-data is used to evaluate the trained model on the primary task, and to optimize the auxiliary tasks to assist the primary task","In the proposed method, meta-data serves as a signal to guide the update of the model's parameters in a way that improves the primary task. It is used in the outer loop of the bi-level optimization process to evaluate the performance of the model on the primary task, represented by the primary task loss function Lpr(·). In other words, meta-data is used to provide guidance for the learning process in a way that improves the primary task.","Our framework SELAR is learning to learn a primary task with multiple auxiliary tasks to assist the primary task. This can be formally written as min w,Θ E [ L pr(w∗ (Θ)) ] (x,y)∼Dpr s.t. w∗ (Θ) = argmin w E L pr+au(w; Θ) (x,y)∼Dpr+au , (2) where L pr(·) is the primary task loss function to evaluate the trained model f(x; w∗ (Θ)) on metadata (a validation for meta-learning [40]) Dpr and L pr+au is the loss function to train a model on training data Dpr+au with the primary and auxiliary tasks. To avoid cluttered notation, f, x, and y are omitted. Each task Tt has Nt samples and T0 and {Tt} T t=1 denote the primary and auxiliary tasks respectively. The proposed formulation in Eq. (2) learns how to assist the primary task by optimizing Θ via meta-learning. The nested optimization problem given Θ is a regular training with properly adjusted loss functions to balance the primary and auxiliary tasks. The formulation can be more specifically written as"
Why is bi-level optimization for meta-learning difficult?,"Bi-level optimization for meta-learning is difficult because it involves optimizing two levels of variables: the model parameters (w) and the meta-parameters (θ) that learn to select and balance the tasks. This creates a challenging optimization problem, as the gradients of the meta-parameters with respect to the model parameters are not easily computable, and the optimization process can become computationally expensive","The goal is to optimize these parameters in a way that improves the performance of the primary task by utilizing the auxiliary tasks. The optimization process becomes difficult because the primary task and auxiliary tasks may have conflicting objectives, making it challenging to find a set of parameters that work well for both. Additionally, the nested optimization problem can become computationally expensive.","The model parameters \mathbf{w}^{k} for tasks can be updated with optimized \Theta^{k+1} in (7) as\displaystyle\mathbf{w}^{k+1}=\mathbf{w}^{k}-\alpha\nabla_{\mathbf{w}}\mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w}^{k};\Theta^{k+1}).(8)Remarks. The proposed formulation can suffer from the meta-overfitting antoniou2018train ; zintgraf2018fast  meaning that the parameters \Theta to learn weights for softly selecting meta-paths and balancing the tasks with the primary task can overfit to the small meta-dataset.In our experiment, we found that the overfitting can be alleviated by meta-validation sets antoniou2018train .To learn \Theta that is generalizable across meta-training sets, we optimize \Theta across k different meta-datasets like k-fold cross validation using the following equation:Θk+1=Θk−β𝔼[∇Θℒp⁢r(𝐰^k(Θk))],Dp⁢r⁢(m⁢e⁢t⁢a)∼CV\displaystyle\Theta^{k+1}\;=\;\underset{D^{pr(meta)}\sim CV\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;}{\Theta^{k}\;-\;\;\beta\;\;\mathbb{E}\left[\;\nabla_{\Theta}\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k}(\Theta^{k}))\;\right],}roman_Θ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k + 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = start_UNDERACCENT italic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r ( italic_m italic_e italic_t italic_a ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∼ italic_C italic_V end_UNDERACCENT start_ARG roman_Θ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_β blackboard_E [ ∇ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( over^ start_ARG bold_w end_ARG start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_Θ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) ) ] , end_ARG(9)where D^{pr(meta)}\sim CV is a meta-dataset from cross validation. We used 3-fold cross validation and the gradients of \Theta w.r.t different meta-datasets are averaged to update \Theta^{k}, see Algorithm 1. The cross validation is crucial to alleviate meta-overfitting and more discussion is Section 4.3. To circumvent the difficulty of the bi-level optimization, as previous works [39, 40] in meta-learning we approximate it with the updated parameters wˆ using the gradient descent update as w∗ (Θ) ≈ wˆ k (Θk ) = wk − α∇wL pr+au(wk ; Θk ), (6) where α is the learning rate for w. We do not numerically evaluate wˆ k (Θ) instead we plug the computational graph of wˆ k in L pr(w∗ (Θ)) to optimize Θ. Let ∇ΘL pr(w∗ (Θk )) be the gradient evaluated at Θk . Then updating parameters Θ is given as Θ k+1 = Θk − β∇ΘL pr(wˆ k (Θk )), (7) where β is the learning rate for Θ. This update allows softly selecting useful auxiliary tasks (metapaths) and balance them with the primary task to improve the performance of the primary task."
What is the anchor point in this paper?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

$\mathcal{P}^{\mathcal{A}}$","In this paper, the anchor points are a subset of a set of points (denoted as P) that are selected using the Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) algorithm. The anchor points are chosen by first selecting a random point and then sequentially choosing the farthest points from the previous points.","Sampling anchor points is the first step of our framework to locate multiple local transformations.To minimize the redundancy between local transformations, the anchor points \mathcal{P}^{\mathcal{A}}\subset\mathcal{P} are selected by the Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) algorithm.FPS randomly chooses the first point and then sequentially chooses the farthest points from previous points.This maximizes the coverage of anchor points and allows diverse transformations."
What does it mean the realistic sample?,"Realistic samples are samples that have smooth deformations and preserve discriminative structures, unlike CDA which has discontinuous shapes and loses discriminative structures","A realistic sample in this context refers to a 3D object that has undergone a smooth deformation, meaning that the shape of the object changes gradually rather than abruptly. The realistic samples that the authors aim to generate are those that resemble real-world objects with diverse shapes and deformations, such as airplanes with varying wing lengths and directions, guitars with different sizes and aspect ratios, and people with different heights and postures.","Smooth deformations are key to generate realistic and locally transformed samples.A naïve application of a random local transformation within its finite neighborhood may result in a discontinuous shape and an overlap of different parts. It has a high chance to lose discriminative structures.Instead, we employ the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression [27, 28] to smoothly interpolate the local transformations in the 3D space.Given M local transformations \{T_{j}\}_{j=1}^{M}, our smoothly varying transformation at an arbitrary point \mathbf{p}_{i} is given as:\small\hat{T}(\mathbf{p}_{i})=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{M}{K_{h}}(\mathbf{p}_{i},\mathbf{p}^{\mathcal{A}}_{j})T_{j}}{\sum_{k=1}^{M}{K_{h}}(\mathbf{p}_{i},\mathbf{p}^{\mathcal{A}}_{k})},(3)where K_{h}(\cdot,\cdot) is a kernel function with bandwidth h, and T_{j} is the local transformation in (2) centered at \mathbf{p}^{\mathcal{A}}_{j}.To define \hat{T}(\mathbf{p}_{i}) at any point in the 3D space, we use a kernel function that has a strictly positive value for any pair of points,i.e., K_{h}(\mathbf{p}_{i},\mathbf{p}_{j})>0 for \forall\mathbf{p}_{i},\forall\mathbf{p}_{j}.The following proposition theoretically guarantees that our augmentation is a smooth transformation under mild conditions. The proof is in the supplement. Thus, CDA is simply a similarity transformation with small jittering that cannot simulate diverse shapes and deformable objects.Unlike synthetic datasets like ModelNet [14] and ShapeNet [26], a real-world dataset like ScanObjectNN [1] further necessitates the generation of sophisticated deformations such as a mixture of local transformations.These are exemplified in Figure 1: airplanes with varying lengths and directions of wings and body, guitars in varying sizes and aspect ratios, and people with different heights and postures (e.g., crossing legs)."
Why should the proposed method have smoothly varying weights for transformations?,To avoid discontinuous shape and loss of discriminative structures,"The proposed method uses smoothly varying weights for transformations to generate realistic and locally transformed samples. The reason for this is that a naive application of a random local transformation within its finite neighborhood can result in a discontinuous shape and an overlap of different parts, leading to loss of discriminative structures, which can make the augmented object unrealistic. By using smoothly varying weights, the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression is able to interpolate the local transformations in the 3D space smoothly, resulting in a more realistic and locally transformed sample.","Smooth deformations are key to generate realistic and locally transformed samples.A naïve application of a random local transformation within its finite neighborhood may result in a discontinuous shape and an overlap of different parts. It has a high chance to lose discriminative structures.Instead, we employ the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression [27, 28] to smoothly interpolate the local transformations in the 3D space.Given M local transformations \{T_{j}\}_{j=1}^{M}, our smoothly varying transformation at an arbitrary point \mathbf{p}_{i} is given as:\small\hat{T}(\mathbf{p}_{i})=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{M}{K_{h}}(\mathbf{p}_{i},\mathbf{p}^{\mathcal{A}}_{j})T_{j}}{\sum_{k=1}^{M}{K_{h}}(\mathbf{p}_{i},\mathbf{p}^{\mathcal{A}}_{k})},(3)where K_{h}(\cdot,\cdot) is a kernel function with bandwidth h, and T_{j} is the local transformation in (2) centered at \mathbf{p}^{\mathcal{A}}_{j}.To define \hat{T}(\mathbf{p}_{i}) at any point in the 3D space, we use a kernel function that has a strictly positive value for any pair of points,i.e., K_{h}(\mathbf{p}_{i},\mathbf{p}_{j})>0 for \forall\mathbf{p}_{i},\forall\mathbf{p}_{j}.The following proposition theoretically guarantees that our augmentation is a smooth transformation under mild conditions. The proof is in the supplement."
Why is it necessary to maximize the coverage of anchor points?,To ensure diverse transformations and minimize redundancy between local transformations,"Maximizing the coverage of anchor points is necessary in order to ensure that the local transformations are being applied evenly across the entire input space. This allows for a more diverse set of augmented samples to be generated, which can help to improve the robustness and generalization of a model trained on the augmented data.","We present a simple yet effective point cloud augmentation with weighted local transformations (PointWOLF).Our method generates deformation for point clouds by a convex combination of multiple transformations with smoothly varying weights.PointWOLF first selects several anchor points and locates random local transformations (e.g., similarity transformations) at the anchor points.Based on the distance from a point in the input to the anchor points, our method differentially applies the local transformations.The smoothly varying weights based on the distance to the anchor points allow spatially continuous augmentation and generate realistic samples.Our framework can be viewed as a kernel regression with transformations. Sampling anchor points is the first step of our framework to locate multiple local transformations.To minimize the redundancy between local transformations, the anchor points \mathcal{P}^{\mathcal{A}}\subset\mathcal{P} are selected by the Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) algorithm.FPS randomly chooses the first point and then sequentially chooses the farthest points from previous points.This maximizes the coverage of anchor points and allows diverse transformations."
What is the difficulty of augmentation on point clouds compared to augmentation on traditional 2d images?,"More difficult.

Unlike 2D images with clear structures, point clouds are unordered sets of points with no inherent global structures, making it challenging to augment them effectively","The difficulty of augmentation on point clouds compared to traditional 2D images is primarily due to the unordered and unstructured nature of point clouds. Unlike 2D images, which have a well-defined grid structure and pixels with fixed locations, point clouds are just a collection of points in 3D space. This makes it harder to apply standard image augmentation techniques, such as rotation and scaling, to point clouds. Additionally, point clouds often have missing or incomplete data, which can make it difficult to generate realistic augmentations.","Modern deep learning techniques, which established their popularity on structured data, began showing success on point clouds.Unlike images with clear lattice structures, each point cloud is an unordered set of points with no inherent structures that globally represent various 3D objects.Recent deep learning efforts have focused on enabling neural networks to operate on point clouds.While several point cloud datasets appeared, a particular dataset of scanned real-world objects [1] required a much greater understanding of the point cloud structures to identify highly complex real-world objects.In response, the approaches have evolved from extracting point-wise information with no structural information [2] to explicitly encoding the local structure [3].These works on network development have been making steady progress despite the scarcity of point cloud data."
What does non-linguistic means?,"Non-linguistic refers to tasks and concepts that are not related to language, such as performing quantitative computations, recognizing regular expressions, or identifying palindromes","Non-linguistic is something which is not related to linguistic information, and it includes the tasks such as quantitative computation and decimal operation.","In this paper, we explore whether pretraining on text is inherently about learning language, or if pretraining also imbues LMs with skills for symbolic manipulation and non-linguistic reasoning (for example, performing quantitative computation such as finding the median of a set of numbers, recognizing regular expressions, or identifying whether a string is a palindrome, as shown in Figure 1). In other words, we investigate whether and how pretraining develops helpful inductive biases for non-linguistic reasoning. For this analysis, we create a set of 19 tasks from three categories of task paradigms: quantitative computation (§3.1), recognizing regular expressions (§3.2), and string reasoning (§3.3). Figure 1 shows an example for each category, and the full list of tasks is described in the table 1. We experiment with transformer and RNN based LMs (§4) for learning these tasks, and perform a comparative analysis with (non-pretrained) neural model variants from the perspective of learning metrics such as accuracy and sample efficiency. Tables 2 and 3 shows the average accuracy of six non-linguistic tasks (palindrome classification, isogram classification, tautonym classification, odd even classification, decimal operation and median) fine-tuned using different BERT and DeBERTA representations respectively. We note that the models pretrained on all three domains outperformed the non-pretrained model (NP). This suggests that the results of experiments in Section 5 generalize to new text corpora for pretraining, and do not rely on having access to text on specific topics during pretraining. This is a non-trivial result, since it suggests for example, that the higher performance of pretrained models on tasks such as palindrome and anagram classification is not due to the pretrained models having seen information about such concepts during pretraining. This is especially so since the results even generalize to ROC stories, which contain no information on such technical concepts. "
"Is this true? Despite using three different pretraining data (text domain), the model shows similar accuracy in big sample case.",Yes,It's false.

In Table 2, we note that all three non-English pretrained LMs significantly outperformed non-pretrained models, with the best performance being comparable or marginally lower than English versions. In fact, Code-BERT surprisingly surpasses ROC by 5%. These findings strongly indicate that the advantages from pretraining have little to do with the format of the tasks, since they persist for scenarios with little shared linguistic structure. "
Does codeBERT trained by natural language?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

No","No, CodeBERT trained by code from six programming language.","A possible rationale for explaining the beneficial effect of pretraining for non-linguistic tasks is that irrespective of whether the tasks require non-linguistic reasoning, their format is in language, and hence language models should be able to learn these tasks with fewer examples. To test this hypothesis, we also experiment with models pretrained on text from languages different from English, as well as models pretrained on computer code. These include the following models: Multilingual BERT.Multilingual BERT is pretrained on text from 102 different languages. About 21% of the pretraining text is English.Chinese BERT.Chinese BERT is a BERT model pretrained on Chinese text. Code BERT.CodeBERT Feng et al. (2020) is pretrained on code from six programming languages."
Does DeBERTa has a larger representations dimensions than BERT large?,"No, DeBERTa has smaller representation dimensions than BERT large","No, because dimension of BERT-large is 1024, and DeBERTa is 768.","Next, we describe the LMs and their variants used in NILM.

(2018).It has 3 layers and the output representations have 1024 dimensions. "
"According to the paper, does BERT is overfitted?","No, BERT is not overfitted. The paper shows that the pre-trained BERT models outperformed the non-pre-trained model (NP) on all six non-linguistic tasks, indicating that BERT is not overfitted to the specific tasks or domains",They say that the reason of good performance of fine-tuned model is not caused by task specific knowledge.,"Tables 2 and 3 shows the average accuracy of six non-linguistic tasks (palindrome classification, isogram classification, tautonym classification, odd even classification, decimal operation and median) fine-tuned using different BERT and DeBERTA representations respectively.

Is this true?: Calculating length of a string is string reasoning task.,No,Calculating length of a string is not a string reasoning task because it does not require character composition within or with another string.,"This task paradigm focuses on reasoning tasks over individual strings or pairs of strings. Palindrome classification.A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward. The task is to classify whether a given string is a palindrome. The string length ranges from 1 to 15.Anagram classification.Two strings are anagrams if one is formed by rearranging letters from the other. The task is to classify if a pair of strings are anagrams. The string length ranges from 2 to 15.Isogram classification.A string is an isogram if it has no repeating characters. The task is to classify whether a given string is an isogram. The string length ranges from 1 to 52.Tautonym classification.A tautonym is a word which can be broken down into two identical parts, with the same spelling. The task is to classify whether a given string is a tautonym. The string length ranges from 1 to 10. Length of a string.Output the length of a given string. The string length ranges from 1 to 10.Count of unique characters.Given a string, count the number of unique characters in it. The string lengths ranges from 10 to 30.Parity check.Given a binary string, output if the counts of ones and zeros are the same. The maximum length of the binary string is 20.Vowels classification.Given a string, classify if the string contains only vowel characters. The string length ranges from 3 to 10. Maximum frequent character.Given a string, output the character with the maximum frequency. The string length ranges from 5 to 30. String reasoning: Figures 6 show the results on Palindrome, Anagram, Isogram and Tautonym classification. These tasks require character comparison within the string or with another string. Again, the pretrained variants consistently outperformed non-pretrained models variants in all of these tasks. In particular, the non-pretrained models completely fail to learn the Anagram and Palindrome tasks even for the largest training set size. Again, Transformer based LMs outperform LSTM based LMs."
Is this true? NILM has only classification tasks.,No,"It's true, becase NILM has three kinds of tasks, and all tasks it classification task.","In this section, we describe the tasks used for our analysis, which we refer to as NILM (measuring Non-linguistic Inductive bias in Language Models).

The descriptions for all the tasks with input and output examples, class labels and the input range are shown in Table 1. Each task has a synthetically generated dataset with train/dev/test splits222The training set size for all tasks is 10K, dev set size is 1K and test set size is 1K, except for tasks on recognizing regular expressions, where the test set size is 2K following previous work Bhattamishra et al.

How is SNLI sort and SNLI shuffle different?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

How Zipf distribution and Uniform distribution different?,"Zipf distribution and Uniform distribution differ in the way they allocate probability to words. In Zipf distribution, the probability of a word is inversely proportional to its frequency, while in Uniform distribution, all words have an equal probability","Zipf distribution consists of words which picked with a unigram probability that follows Zipf's law. However, uniform distribution consists of words that sampled with a uniform unigram probability.","Zipf distribution. We select 30k words (types) from the Amazon reviews dataset. Words are picked with a unigram probability that follows Zipf’s word frequency law, which all natural languages empirically follow Piantadosi (2014). For the Zipf distribution, we chose \alpha=1 and \beta=2.7, to match the parameters of most natural languages. The text does not follow any word order.Uniform distribution. In this dataset, words are sampled from the same vocabulary as in ‘Zipf distribution’, but with a uniform unigram probability. The text does not follow any word order.Synthetic Vocabulary. Words are selected with uniform distribution from a vocabulary to form sentences. However, instead of a vocabulary of English words, the words in the vocabulary are also synthetically generated (3 letter combinations of lower-case alphabets).

How is this paper and other previous works which have explored the ability of RNN and Transformer architecture?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

What does NILM means? Is it different to GLUE?,"NILM stands for Non-linguistic Inductive bias in Language Models, and it is different from GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) which focuses on linguistic knowledge and reasoning tasks",NILM is the dataset of measuring Non-linguistic Inductive bias in Language Models. It is different with GLUE since GLUE focus on tasks require linguistic knowledge and reasoning.,"Pretrained Language Models (LMs) have shown singular succcess on a range of natural language understandings tasks, to the extent that they have become foundational for contemporary NLP systems. Several works have investigated why pretraining works so well Warstadt et al. (2019); Zhao et al. (2020). In particular, studies have shown that the pretrained LMs like BERT capture linguistic knowledge about syntax Lin et al. (2019); Wu et al. (2020), semantics Vulić et al. (2020b, a) and morphology Hofmann et al. (2020, 2021). In fact, Tenney et al. (2019) demonstrated that learned representations in pretrained LMs even internally reflect the classical NLP pipeline. Since most NLP benchmarks such as SuperGLUE Wang et al. (2019) naturally are focused on tasks such as textual entailment and reading comprehension that require linguistic knowledge and reasoning, it is unsurprising that LMs have achieved strong results on these tasks. On the other hand, little work so far has explored the abilities of pretrained LMs for learning non-linguistic tasks.  In this section, we describe the tasks used for our analysis, which we refer to as NILM (measuring Non-linguistic Inductive bias in Language Models).

What does SNLI means? Is it a model?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

SNLI is a dataset, not a model. It stands for Stanford Natural Language Inference dataset, which is a collection of labeled text pairs used for training and evaluating natural language inference models",SNLI is one of benchmark dataset published in 2015.,"SNLI. We pretrained BERT small from scratch on SNLI data Bowman et al. (2015). It has 1000k sentences (570k pairs of text and hypothesis). Amazon reviews. We selected 500k movies and tv reviews from the larger Amazon reviews dataset He and McAuley (2016) and used for pretraining. Since reviews are in a free-text format, and their collection was not tailored with a NLP task in mind, they might be more representative of the complexity of real-world language use than SNLI.ROC. ROC is a corpora of 100K children stories, each made up of five sentences Mostafazadeh et al. (2017). The language in ROC is relatively simple in both vocabulary and sentence structure."
Explain Mode task in Decimal & word operation with examples.,"Mode task in Decimal & word operation involves finding the most frequently occurring number in a set of numbers, where the numbers can be represented in either decimal or word notation.

For example, if we have the set {3, 5, 2, 7, 1, 4}, the mode would be 3, because it appears most frequently in the set.

Another example would be {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}, where the mode would be 40, because it appears most frequently in the set.

What does inductive bias means?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Inductive bias refers to the preconceptions and assumptions that a machine learning model makes about the structure of the data it is trained on",Inductive bias is performance gain of pretrained model in different linguistic structure.,"Finally, in our discussion, we conceptually stretch the notion of inductive bias. The idea of inductive bias is usually associated with specific model types McCoy et al. (2020); Kharitonov and Chaabouni (2021), architectures Xu et al. (2021); Brutzkus and Globerson (2021) and regularization approaches Helmbold and Long (2015). We believe that extending this to refer to learning tasks with pretrained LMs is both reasonable and useful. "

What are the examples of offline RL algorithms that are not straightforwardly applicable to the task-oriented dialogue domain?,Behavior Cloning and Decision Transformer,Most of the algorithms based on the policy gradient such as actor-critic are not straightforwardly applicable to the task-oriented dialogue domain,"Training a task-oriented conversational agent from a dialogue corpus can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine reinforcement learning (RL) problem (Levine et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020), which offers the prospect to optimize the policy solely from the ﬁxed dataset without online environment interaction. Most of the existing ofﬂine RL methods are built on the off-policy Actor- Critic framework, which performs iterative optimization of the policy (i.e. actor) and the action- value function (i.e. critic) (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Janner et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020). Yet, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods generally results in poor dialogue strategies which generate responses in no way similar to human language (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). Ofﬂine Reinforcement Learning. There have been extensive studies on ofﬂine RL (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Levine et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Most of prior works are built on the off-policy actor-critic framework, and they focus on the overestimation issue by taking the OOD actions (Kumar et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020). However, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods suffer from the issue of diverging from human language in the task-oriented dialogues (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). On the other hand, there are a number of recent works on weighted behavior cloning, where a policy is trained by a variant of supervised learning loss (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). The weighted behavior cloning approaches ﬁlter out bad actions, then perform behavior cloning on high-quality data. However, in the task-oriented dialogues, simply dropping the unsuccessful dialogues from the corpus is undesirable, since they may contain some task-speciﬁc information that is useful to properly respond to user requests. Our GPT-Critic aims to revise unsuccessful dialogues into successful ones, which is in contrast to the weighted behavior cloning on the ﬁxed training dataset, where the action choice is restricted to the support in the dataset (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). More recently, Chen et al. (2021) introduce Decision Transformer, a Transformer-based architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. These ofﬂine RL methods based on behavior cloning are directly applied to the task-oriented dialogues without aforementioned issue, but their results are similar to that of behavior cloning in the task-oriented dialogues."
How does the author show that the algorithm is free from the issue of diverging from human-language?,"The author shows that the algorithm is free from the issue of diverging from human-language by comparing the performance of GPT-Critic with baseline algorithms on two evaluation metrics: appropriateness and fluency. The results indicate that GPT-Critic significantly outperforms baseline algorithms in appropriateness, which is related to task accomplishment, and does not hurt the agent's capability to generate human-like sentences in terms of fluency",The authors show it by conducting the human evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).,"We also conduct human evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess the quality of gen- erated responses of GPT-Critic and baseline algorithms, using the evaluation protocol as in (Yang et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Speciﬁcally, human workers on AMT were asked to read the context and generated response by interactive simulation via ConvLab, then score the following two evaluation metrics on a Likert scale (1-5): 1) Appropriateness : evaluates whether the generated responses are appropriate for the given context, 2) Fluency : evaluates whether the gen- erated responses are comprehensible and human-like. We compare the performance of GPT-Critic with same baselines on ConvLab evaluation. Figure 3 summarizes the overall results of human eval- uation, where 60 workers evaluate the quality of 30 randomly selected dialogues for each algorithm.

What are the metrics used to evaluate the performance in terms of task success?,Success and Complete,"This work evaluates the performance in terms of task success by using following metrics: 1) In- form : evaluates whether the system provides an appropriate entity, 2) Success : evaluates whether the system answers all the requested information, 3) Book: evaluates how many booked entities satisfy the user constraints, 4) Inform (Precision / Recall / F1): evaluates how many user requests have been informed.","We evaluate our algorithm on the MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset, which is one of the representative task- oriented dialogue benchmarks. The MultiWOZ 2.0 is a large-scale multi-domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset, where a tourist (i.e. user) converses with a clerk (i.e. system) at the information center in a touristic city. It consists of 8438/1000/1000 dialogues for training/validation/testing. For end-to-end evaluation on the MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset, we use the following automatic evaluation metrics: 1) In- form : evaluates whether the system provides an appropriate entity, 2) Success : evaluates whether the system answers all the requested information, 3) BLEU : measures the ﬂuency of the generated response (Papineni et al., 2002). We also report the Combined Score as an overall quality measure In order to evaluate the performance of dialogue agents in an end-to-end fashion, we conduct simulator-based evaluation on ConvLab (Zhu et al., 2020). ConvLab is an open-source toolkit that enables to build task-oriented dialogue systems and perform an end-to-end evaluation. The simulator-based evaluation is more reliable than dataset-based automatic evaluation because it eval- uates the performance while interacting with the user simulator. To interact with dialogue systems, ConvLab provides an agenda-based user simulator (Schatzmann et al., 2007) that consists of a BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) for NLU, a rule-based policy, and a template-based NLG. We compare the per- formance of GPT-Critic with baseline algorithms interacting with the same user simulator and user goals. We report the results with the following metrics: 1) Complete : evaluates whether the sys- tem completes the goal, 2) Success : evaluates whether all the user requests have been informed and the booked entities satisfy the constraints, 3) Book : evaluates how many booked entities satisfy the We also conduct human evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess the quality of gen- erated responses of GPT-Critic and baseline algorithms, using the evaluation protocol as in (Yang et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).

Did the authors have an experiment with training the state-of-the-art offline RL algorithm with MultiWOZ dataset?,"Yes, the authors trained the state-of-the-art offline RL algorithm, CRR, with the MultiWOZ dataset",The authors provide experimental results of CRR and Decision Transformer as baselines of offline RL algorithm.,"In this section, we show the experimental results of GPT-critic on both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. First, we evaluate the performances of GPT-Critic on the MultiWOZ 2.0 (Budzianowski et al., 2018) as dataset-based automatic evaluation, compared with baseline methods including ofﬂine RL algorithms. Second, for more realistic evaluation, we conduct a simulator-based evaluation on the ConvLab framework (Zhu et al., 2020). Third, we also conduct the human eval- uation to evaluate the quality of generated responses. Finally, we give a qualitative analysis of our method using generated dialogue examples on the training dataset of MultiWOZ 2.0, which shows how GPT-Critic improves the performance through the behavior cloning of self-generated dialogues. The qualitative analysis with generated dialogue examples can be found in Appendix B. In addition, we also compare with recent ofﬂine RL algorithms that are free from the issue of di- verging from human language: 1) CRR (Wang et al., 2020), a value-ﬁltered regression method that performs weighted behavior cloning of ofﬂine dataset, 2) Decision Transformer (Chen et al., 2021), a Transformer-based architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. For a fair comparison, we use the same pre-trained GPT-2 model as a policy network to train the CRR and the Decision Transformer. Moreover, to show that the policy-gradient-based standard RL algorithms suffer from diverging from human language, we also provide examples of responses generated by policy-gradient-based standard RL algorithm in Appendix D. For the results of ofﬂine RL baselines, CRR and Decision Transformer show the results that do not diverge from human-language, since their policy is also trained by behavior cloning. However, both algorithms show limited performance because they perform behavior cloning on a ﬁxed dataset. CRR has achieved remarkable success in continuous control tasks by performing weighted behavior cloning of training dataset ﬁltered by critic, but it does not effectively perform in the task-oriented dialogues because of data scarcity. Furthermore, to evaluate the Decision Transformer, we adopt a delayed return where the agent receives the cumulative reward at the end of dialogue, since the agent cannot observe user goal. Therefore, without observing the user goal at test time, Decision Transformer reduces to the behavior cloning of successful dialogues."
CRR is also an algorithm that is free from issues that diverge from human language. What are the advantages compared to CRR?,"GPT-Critic has advantages over CRR in terms of its ability to revise unsuccessful dialogues into successful ones, whereas CRR only performs weighted behavior cloning on a fixed dataset","CRR is a variant of weighted behavior cloning approaches that perform behavior cloning with a learned weight on a fixed dataset. In contrast to the CRR, where the action choice is restricted to the support in the given dataset, the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the policy by revising unsuccessful dialogues into successful ones.","Ofﬂine Reinforcement Learning. There have been extensive studies on ofﬂine RL (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Levine et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Most of prior works are built on the off-policy actor-critic framework, and they focus on the overestimation issue by taking the OOD actions (Kumar et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020). However, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods suffer from the issue of diverging from human language in the task-oriented dialogues (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). On the other hand, there are a number of recent works on weighted behavior cloning, where a policy is trained by a variant of supervised learning loss (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). The weighted behavior cloning approaches ﬁlter out bad actions, then perform behavior cloning on high-quality data. However, in the task-oriented dialogues, simply dropping the unsuccessful dialogues from the corpus is undesirable, since they may contain some task-speciﬁc information that is useful to properly respond to user requests. Our GPT-Critic aims to revise unsuccessful dialogues into successful ones, which is in contrast to the weighted behavior cloning on the ﬁxed training dataset, where the action choice is restricted to the support in the dataset (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). More recently, Chen et al. (2021) introduce Decision Transformer, a Transformer-based architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. These ofﬂine RL methods based on behavior cloning are directly applied to the task-oriented dialogues without aforementioned issue, but their results are similar to that of behavior cloning in the task-oriented dialogues. For the results of ofﬂine RL baselines, CRR and Decision Transformer show the results that do not diverge from human-language, since their policy is also trained by behavior cloning. However, both algorithms show limited performance because they perform behavior cloning on a ﬁxed dataset.

They claim that the proposed algorithm can maintain the GPT-2’s ability to generate human-like responses while improving the task performance. Is this true?,"Yes. According to the results in Table 3 and the human evaluation in Figure 3, the proposed GPT-Critic algorithm does maintain the ability of GPT-2 to generate human-like responses while improving the task performance","The authors claim that the proposed algorithm can maintain the GPT-2’s ability to generate human-like responses while improving the task performance. In the experiments, they show that the proposed method improves the task performance without the issue of diverging from human language.","Table 3 summarizes the overall performance of GPT-Critic and baseline algorithms in end-to-end response generation setting, where the generated dialogue state and generated dialogue act are used for the DB search and response generation. The results show that GPT-Critic achieved the best performance in terms of inform rate, success rate, and combined score. Moreover, the performance of GPT-Critic on the BLEU score matches those of other pre-trained LM-based methods, since GPT-Critic inherits GPT-2’s ability to generate human-like responses through the behavior cloning of responses generated by GPT-2. The results show that GPT-Critic improves the task performance of the agent without the issue of diverging from human language. In addition, as can be shown in Table 3, the naive data augmentation is not effective since it will not change the GPT’s sampling distribution in principle. We also conduct human evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess the quality of gen- erated responses of GPT-Critic and baseline algorithms, using the evaluation protocol as in (Yang et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).

How are actions defined in task-oriented dialogue?,Actions in task-oriented dialogue are defined as a sequence of tokens representing dialogue acts and system responses,"In task-oriented dialogues, the actions are defined as a sequence of tokens which represents dialogue act and system response.","We consider the task-oriented dialogue system that can be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) (Williams & Young, 2007) deﬁned by tuple (cid:104) S, A, O, T, Z, R, γ (cid:105) where S is the set of environment states s = (cid:104) g, h (cid:105) (underlying state that consists of the user goal g and dialogue history h ), A is the set of actions a (a sequence of tokens which represents dialogue act and system response ), O is the set of observations o (user utterance), T ( s (cid:48) | s, a ) = Pr( s t +1 = s (cid:48) | s t = s, a t = a ) is the transition function, Z ( o | s (cid:48) , a ) = Pr( o t +1 = o | s t +1 = s (cid:48) , a t = a ) is the observation probability, R ( g, h, a ) is the reward function indicating the utility of executing action a in history h and the user goal g , and γ ∈ (0 , 1) is a discount factor. The history at time step t , h t = { o 0 , a 0 , . . . o t − 1 , a t − 1 , o t } , is a sequence of all previous observations and actions. Since the underlying state s (e.g. user goal) is not directly observable, the agent makes decisions based on the entire observation-action history. The policy π ( a t | h t ) is mapping from history h t to a probability distribution over A . The goal is to ﬁnd an optimal policy π ∗ that maximizes the expected cumulative rewards, i.e. π ∗ = arg max π E π [ (cid:80) ∞ t =0 γ t R ( g, h t , a t )] . The action-value function of policy π is deﬁned as Q π ( h, a ) := E π [ (cid:80) ∞ t =0 γ t R ( g, h t , a t ) | h 0 = h, a 0 = a ] , where Q π is a unique solution of the Bellman equation: Q π ( h, a ) = E g [ R ( g, h, a )] + γ E π [ Q π ( h (cid:48) , a (cid:48) )] ."
What does “KL control” means?,"KL control refers to a technique used to restrict the policy of a reinforcement learning agent to stay close to its prior policy, in order to prevent divergence from human language",KL control means that the regularization technique to restrict the policy to stay close to its prior policy.,"Reinforcement Learning for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems. Applying the standard RL meth- ods straightforwardly to optimize a task-oriented dialogue agent causes the issue of diverging from human language. To address this problem, interleaving reinforcement learning with supervised learning has been proposed but it is still not free from the issue of diverging from human language (Lewis et al., 2017). Recently, the latent representation models for language actions have been in- troduced to address the aforementioned problem (Zhao et al., 2019; Yarats & Lewis, 2018). They disentangle the semantics of the utterance and the natural language generation, and then perform goal-based training in the space of the latent variables instead of directly optimizing utterances. However, they cannot be directly applied to large-scale pre-trained language models that are not designed in a way that works inherently with discrete latent variables. Jaques et al. (2020) use KL- control to restrict the policy to stay close to its prior policy, but it still suffers from divergence from human language even with carefully chosen hyper-parameters. Furthermore, Jang et al. (2020) adopt Bayes-adaptive Monte-Carlo planning to negotiation dialogue then use it as a policy improvement operator. This approach can prevent the issue of diverging from human language through the policy improvement based on behavior cloning of self-generated dialogues. However, they assume a user model that is difﬁcult enough to be considered another problem."
What does “offline RL” means?,"Offline RL refers to training a reinforcement learning agent from a pre-existing dataset, without interacting with an online environment",Offline RL is one of the reinforcement learning settings that assumes the agent aims to optimize the policy solely from the ﬁxed dataset without online environment interaction.,"Training a task-oriented dialogue agent can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine rein- forcement learning (RL) problem, where the agent aims to learn a conversational strategy to achieve user goals, only from a dialogue corpus. It is very challenging in terms of RL since the natural language action space is astronomical, while feasi- ble (syntactically and semantically correct) actions are very sparse. Thus, standard RL methods easily fail and generate responses diverging from human language, even when ﬁne-tuning a powerful pre-trained language model.

What is “overestimation issue” in RL?,"Overestimation issue in RL refers to the tendency of the agent to overestimate the value of taking an action that leads to an out-of-distribution (OOD) state, rather than the true optimal action that leads to the in-distribution (ID) state",The overestimation issue means the problem when the action values are overestimated by using out-of-distribution actions in RL.,"where ¯ φ is the parameters of the target network. As discussed in the prior work (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020), optimizing this loss can be challenging in the ofﬂine RL setting due to the overestimation issue in the bootstrapping process by taking out-of-distribution (OOD) actions to evaluate the value of the next state.

Building an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue agent is one of the promising applications of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet challenging due to large language action spaces and limited availability of human-annotated data. Recently, large-scale pre-trained language models (LM) have achieved remarkable successes in various NLP tasks with prohibitively large vocabulary (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2019). The current best performing end-to-end conversational agents for a task-oriented dialogue system utilize a pre-training on large- scale corpus and ﬁne-tuning on downstream tasks (Ham et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021). This combination of pre-training and ﬁne-tuning signiﬁcantly improves overall performance in the task-oriented dialogues. However, supervised ﬁne-tuning (i.e. imitation learning of the dialogue corpus) alone may not be sufﬁcient to learn an optimal dialogue strategy since the corpus often contains suboptimal dialogues collected from human participants of diverse expertise levels. Thus, in order to optimize the task performance of the conversational agent, goal- oriented training (i.e. reinforcement learning) is an essential and promising direction to pursue. Training a task-oriented conversational agent from a dialogue corpus can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine reinforcement learning (RL) problem (Levine et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020), which offers the prospect to optimize the policy solely from the ﬁxed dataset without online environment interaction.

GPT-Critic is essentially free from the issue of diverging from human language since it learns from the sentences sam- pled from the pre-trained language model. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in the task-oriented dialogue benchmarks including MultiWOZ 2.0 and ConvLab. We presented GPT-Critic, an ofﬂine RL algorithm for task-oriented dialogue system, which can be adopted for any generative pre-trained language model. GPT-Critic aims to learn an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue agent without the issue of diverging from human language. GPT-Critic starts with ﬁne-tuning the GPT-2 model and learning the critic using the dialogue corpus. Then, GPT- Critic updates the policy through the behavior cloning of the critic-guided self-generated responses, thus it is essentially free from the issue of diverging from human language. In the experiments, we demonstrated that GPT-Critic outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in the task-oriented dialogue benchmarks including MultiWOZ 2.0 and ConvLab. revised responses. Moreover, Table 5 shows that the generated dialogues do not diverge from hu- man language. Since GPT-Critic updates the policy through behavior cloning of the self-generated human-like responses, GPT-Critic is essentially free from the issue of diverging from human lan- guage."
How does the proposed method address the issue of large action spaces?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

They claim that the proposed policy update guarantees the policy improvement. Is this true?,"No.

While the theorem states that the updated policy has a higher value than the old policy, it does not guarantee policy improvement. The theorem only shows that the updated policy has a higher value than the old policy, but it does not guarantee that the updated policy is the best possible policy","Yes, they theoretically show it as the policy improvement theorem in the paper.","We can theoretically show that the updated policy by the above policy improvement step has a higher value than the old policy. Furthermore, we can also theoretically show that updated policy by the higher number of candidate actions has a higher value than the policy updated by the lower number of candidate actions.

Why are most of the existing offline RL algorithms not straightforward to apply to the task-oriented dialogue?,"Most existing offline RL algorithms are not straightforward to apply to task-oriented dialogues because they suffer from the issue of diverging from human language, leading to poor dialogue strategies that do not resemble human language","Since a naive application of existing offline RL algorithms suffer from the issue of diverging from human language, it is not straightforward to apply them to the task-oriented dialogue.","Training a task-oriented conversational agent from a dialogue corpus can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine reinforcement learning (RL) problem (Levine et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020), which offers the prospect to optimize the policy solely from the ﬁxed dataset without online environment interaction. Most of the existing ofﬂine RL methods are built on the off-policy Actor- Critic framework, which performs iterative optimization of the policy (i.e. actor) and the action- value function (i.e. critic) (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Janner et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020). Yet, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods generally results in poor dialogue strategies which generate responses in no way similar to human language (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). Reinforcement Learning for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems. Applying the standard RL meth- ods straightforwardly to optimize a task-oriented dialogue agent causes the issue of diverging from human language. To address this problem, interleaving reinforcement learning with supervised learning has been proposed but it is still not free from the issue of diverging from human language (Lewis et al., 2017). Recently, the latent representation models for language actions have been in- troduced to address the aforementioned problem (Zhao et al., 2019; Yarats & Lewis, 2018). They disentangle the semantics of the utterance and the natural language generation, and then perform goal-based training in the space of the latent variables instead of directly optimizing utterances. However, they cannot be directly applied to large-scale pre-trained language models that are not designed in a way that works inherently with discrete latent variables. Jaques et al. (2020) use KL- control to restrict the policy to stay close to its prior policy, but it still suffers from divergence from human language even with carefully chosen hyper-parameters. Furthermore, Jang et al. (2020) adopt Bayes-adaptive Monte-Carlo planning to negotiation dialogue then use it as a policy improvement operator. This approach can prevent the issue of diverging from human language through the policy improvement based on behavior cloning of self-generated dialogues. However, they assume a user model that is difﬁcult enough to be considered another problem. Ofﬂine Reinforcement Learning. There have been extensive studies on ofﬂine RL (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Levine et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Most of prior works are built on the off-policy actor-critic framework, and they focus on the overestimation issue by taking the OOD actions (Kumar et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020). However, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods suffer from the issue of diverging from human language in the task-oriented dialogues (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). On the other hand, there are a number of recent works on weighted behavior cloning, where a policy is trained by a variant of supervised learning loss (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). The weighted behavior cloning approaches ﬁlter out bad actions, then perform behavior cloning on high-quality data. However, in the task-oriented dialogues, simply dropping the unsuccessful dialogues from the corpus is undesirable, since they may contain some task-speciﬁc information that is useful to properly respond to user requests. Our GPT-Critic aims to revise unsuccessful dialogues into successful ones, which is in contrast to the weighted behavior cloning on the ﬁxed training dataset, where the action choice is restricted to the support in the dataset (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). More recently, Chen et al. (2021) introduce Decision Transformer, a Transformer-based architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. These ofﬂine RL methods based on behavior cloning are directly applied to the task-oriented dialogues without aforementioned issue, but their results are similar to that of behavior cloning in the task-oriented dialogues."
Why does the proposed algorithm not outperforms in turn metric in the results of ConvLab experiments?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

GPT-Critic takes longer dialogue turns because it is trained to maximize success rate without considering dialogue turn","Since a proposed method is trained by maximizing the success rate without considering the dialogue turn, the proposed algorithm does not outperforms in turn metric in the results.","performance in all metrics related to task accomplishment. However, they also show that GPT-Critic takes longer dialogue turn for the task accomplishment because GPT-Critic is trained by maximizing the success rate without considering the dialogue turn."
"In the human evaluation, what does the author want to show differently from MultiWOZ and Convlab experiments?","The author wants to show that GPT-Critic does not hurt the agent's capability to generate human-like sentences, as evidenced by the ﬂuency score being comparable to the baseline algorithms",The author want to show that the proposed method does not suffer from the issue of diverging from human language.,"In this section, we show the experimental results of GPT-critic on both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. First, we evaluate the performances of GPT-Critic on the MultiWOZ 2.0 (Budzianowski et al., 2018) as dataset-based automatic evaluation, compared with baseline methods including ofﬂine RL algorithms. Second, for more realistic evaluation, we conduct a simulator-based evaluation on the ConvLab framework (Zhu et al., 2020). Third, we also conduct the human eval- uation to evaluate the quality of generated responses. Finally, we give a qualitative analysis of our method using generated dialogue examples on the training dataset of MultiWOZ 2.0, which shows how GPT-Critic improves the performance through the behavior cloning of self-generated dialogues. The qualitative analysis with generated dialogue examples can be found in Appendix B. We also conduct human evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess the quality of gen- erated responses of GPT-Critic and baseline algorithms, using the evaluation protocol as in (Yang et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Speciﬁcally, human workers on AMT were asked to read the context and generated response by interactive simulation via ConvLab, then score the following two evaluation metrics on a Likert scale (1-5): 1) Appropriateness : evaluates whether the generated responses are appropriate for the given context, 2) Fluency : evaluates whether the gen- erated responses are comprehensible and human-like. We compare the performance of GPT-Critic with same baselines on ConvLab evaluation. Figure 3 summarizes the overall results of human eval- uation, where 60 workers evaluate the quality of 30 randomly selected dialogues for each algorithm. The results show that GPT-Critic signiﬁcantly outperforms baseline algorithms in appropriateness which is related to task accomplishment. Moreover, the result of ﬂuency shows that GPT-Critic does not hurt the agent’s capability to generate human-like sentences."
What is different between the results denoted by planning and learning in Table 2.,"The results denoted by planning and learning in Table 2 differ in their improvement patterns for PUCT-RL and MC-LAVE-RL. While PUCT-RL improves initially but converges to a suboptimal policy, MC-LAVE-RL consistently improves over time by using Q-Network for credit assignment and focusing exploration on semantically promising actions","The results denoted by planning report the performance of planning through the simulation, and the results denoted by learning report the performance without further simulation.","In order to understand the effectiveness of MC-LAVE as a policy improvement operator, we compare the performances of PUCT-RL and MC-LAVE-RL in Z ORK 1. Table 2 reports the intermediate results of planning and supervised learning in each iteration of the policy iteration. In each iteration, the policy and the Q-function are trained using planning trajectories and experience replay collected from 25 independent planning agents. As can be seen in Table 2, the performance of MC-LAVE-RL is improved more consistently than PUCT-RL, both in planning and learning. At the beginning of the policy iteration, PUCT-RL improves the performance, but it fails to overcome bottleneck and converges to a suboptimal policy: PUCT utilizes the prior policy learned by imitating the planning results of the previous iteration to estimate the exploration bonus, but this uncertainty-based method is not much effective to encourage the agent to explore the action space that is not sufﬁciently covered. On the other hand, MC-LAVE-RL not only uses the prior policy, but also uses Q-Network for credit assignment to language actions. This allows a more focused exploration on semantically promising actions and consequently overcomes the bottleneck to further improve the performance."

Which of the baseline algorithms require the resettable simulator?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

PUCT-RL",MC!Q*BERT and PUCT-RL require the resettable simulator assumption.,"Table 1 summarizes handicaps leveraged in each algorithm and the performance of MC-LAVE-RL and baseline algorithms across 9 IF games included in the Jericho environment. The results show that MC-LAVE-RL outperforms or matches the state-of-the-art results on 8 out of 9 games. Although MC-LAVE-RL requires more handicap or assumption, it performs the same or better than strong baseline MC!Q*BERT which requires similar assumptions and more requirements. In addition, MC-LAVE-RL achieves higher game scores on overall games compared to PUCT-RL, which is a baseline algorithm that only excludes language-driven exploration strategy from MC-LAVE-RL. Furthermore, MC-LAVE-RL performs signiﬁcantly better than other methods on difﬁcult games such as Z ORK 1, D EEPHOME , and L UDICORP , which are categorized by Hausknecht et al. (2020) as a relatively challenging game due to the large action space and sparse rewards."
What is the hyperparameter of the proposed method? How did you tune it? ,"The hyperparameter of the proposed method is the learning rate, which is tuned using a linear warmup followed by cosine scheduling",This is as it is. We mostly follow the practice of Caron et al.,"Training details We train our model on the training set of the ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet-1k dataset [18] without using class labels.

We use a batch size of 4096 and employ the LARS optimizer [52] with a weight decay of 10−6. We use linearly scaled learning rate of lr × batch size/256 [27] with a base learning rate of 0.3. 5 We adjust the learning rate with 10 epochs of a linear warmup followed by cosine scheduling.

Why is it adequate to say this problem is strictly convex? ,"The problem is strictly convex because the objective function s(x) = P Ni xi log xi is strictly convex.

How does the proposed method address the issue of cluster collapse?,MIRA avoids cluster collapse by penalizing assignments that exhibit low mutual information and instead finds MI-maximizing points around the model prediction,Mutual information regularizer unfavors collapsed representation.,"The MI term in Eq. 4 takes a minimum value when collapsing happens.MIRA naturally avoids collapsed solution via penalizing assignment that exhibits low MI.Specifically, unless starting from the collapsed state, MIRA finds MI-maximizing points around the model prediction; it will not choose collapsed pseudo-labels.Hence, the iterative training to predict such labels will not collapse whenever the prediction of pseudo-labels is achievable.Our empirical results verify that MIRA does not require extra training techniques or artificial constraints to address collapsing."
How does the cluster-based method learn meaningful representation from scratch?,"By avoiding collapsing, the cluster-based method can learn meaningful representations from scratch without relying on extra training techniques or artificial assumptions","Clustering methods encourage the representations to encode the semantic structures of the data. While this can be prone to collapse, they rely on extra techniques.","Meanwhile, a line of work uses clustering for un-/self-supervised representation learning.They explicitly assign pseudo-labels to embedded representation via clustering, and the model is thereby trained to predict such labels.These clustering-based methods can account for inter-data similarity; representations are encouraged to encode the semantic structure of data.Prior works Yang et al. (2016); Xie et al. (2016); Bautista et al. (2016); Hu et al. (2017) have shown encouraging results in small-scaled settings; Caron et al. (2018) show that it can also be applied to the large-scaled dataset or even to a non-curated dataset Caron et al. (2019).Recently, several works Asano et al. (2020); Caron et al. (2020); Li et al. (2021) have adopted the philosophy of augmentation invariance and achieved strong empirical results.They typically assign pseudo-labels using augmented views while predicting the labels by looking at other differently augmented views. Despite its conceptual simplicity, a naive application of clustering to representation learning is hard to achieve, especially when training with large-scale datasets.This is because clustering-based methods are prone to collapse, i.e., all samples are assigned to a single cluster; hence, recent methods heavily rely on extra training techniques or artificial constraints, such as pre-training Yan et al. (2020), sampling strategy Caron et al. (2018), equipartition constraints Asano et al. (2020); Caron et al. (2020), to avoid collapsing.However, it is unclear if these additions are appropriate or how such components will affect the representation quality. Many SSL approaches rely on extra training techniques and artificial assumptions to prevent collapsing.In clustering-based methods, DeepCluster Caron et al. (2018) adapts a sampling strategy to sample elements uniformly across pseudo-labels to deal with empty clusters; SeLa Asano et al. (2020) and SwAV Caron et al. (2020) impose equipartition constraints to balance the cluster distribution.Similarly, SelfClassifier Amrani et al. (2021) uses a uniform pseudo-label prior, and PCL Li et al. (2021) employs concentration scaling.DINO Caron et al. (2021) and ReSSL Zheng et al. (2021) address collapsing by specific combinations of implementation details, i.e., centering and scaling with an exponential moving average network; their mechanism for preventing collapse is unclear.In this work, we show our method can naturally avoid collapsing without any of these assumptions or training techniques.We achieve results better than baselines with a simple but novel information regularization algorithm.We take a more detailed comparison with SeLa and SwAV after explaining our method in Sec. 3.3."
"Can clustering-based self-supervised approaches learn a piece of local information? If not, task applicability would be limited.","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

No.

According to the context, MIRA, a clustering-based self-supervised approach, does not learn a piece of local information and is not as dominating as in the classification tasks. This suggests that clustering-based self-supervised approaches may have limited task applicability",MIRA does not perform well in the detection task.,"A.7 Experiments on the detection and segmentation task We test our method on detection segmentation of the COCO 2017 dataset with Masked R-CNN, R50-C4 on a 2x scheduled setting. We use the configuration from the MoCo official implementation. MIRA performs better than the supervised baseline and is comparable to MoCo; it is not as dominating as in the classification tasks."
How is MIRA similar or different compared to other clustering-based methods? (e.g. SwaV),"MIRA is similar to other clustering-based methods such as SwaV in that they both use clustering to learn representations, but MIRA differs in that it does not rely on artificial constraints such as equipartition, and instead uses mutual information regularization to maximize the mutual information between the pseudo-labels and the data","MIRA does not require any artificial constraints or techniques in training, unlike other self-supervised methods. However, MIRA uses some of the techniques used in the other paper.","The pseudo-code of MIRA for representation learning with Eq. 8 is provided in the Appendix.In the following experiments, we verify the effectiveness of MIRA for a representation learning purpose.We note that MIRA can integrate recently suggested self-supervised learning components, such as exponential moving average (EMA) or multi-crop (MC) augmentation strategy following the baselines Chen et al. (2021); Caron et al. (2020, 2021).For convenience, in the rest of this paper, we call the representation learning with MIRA also as MIRA.We discuss some further details as follows: Despite its conceptual simplicity, a naive application of clustering to representation learning is hard to achieve, especially when training with large-scale datasets.This is because clustering-based methods are prone to collapse, i.e., all samples are assigned to a single cluster; hence, recent methods heavily rely on extra training techniques or artificial constraints, such as pre-training Yan et al. (2020), sampling strategy Caron et al. (2018), equipartition constraints Asano et al. (2020); Caron et al. (2020), to avoid collapsing.However, it is unclear if these additions are appropriate or how such components will affect the representation quality. SeLa Asano et al. (2020) and SwAV Caron et al. (2020) formulate their pseudo-labeling process into optimization problems, i.e., optimal transport (OT) problem, and solve it iteratively with Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm Cuturi (2013).To avoid collapse and apply the SK algorithm, they assume the equipartition of data into clusters.Mathematically, the difference to MIRA is in how to deal with the marginal entropy.SeLa and SwAV constrain the marginal entropy to maximum value–equipartition while MIRA decides it by MI regularization333Adding the equipartition constraint into Eq. 4, our problem converts to the OT problem of SwAV Caron et al. (2020)..Asano et al. (2020) argue that their pseudo-labels with the OT problem maximize the MI between labels and data indices under the equipartition constraint.However, it more resembles assuming MI maximization and then finding the cluster assignments that are optimal transport to the model prediction.In contrast, MIRA directly maximizes the MI by regularization without artificial constraints.While SwAV performs better than SeLa in most self-supervised benchmarks, we verify that MIRA improves over SwAV in various downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose Mutual Information Regularized Assignment (MIRA), a pseudo-labeling algorithm that enables clustering-based SSL without any artificial constraints or extra training techniques.MIRA is designed to follow the infomax principle Linsker (1988) and the intuition that good labels are something that can reduce most of the uncertainty about the data.Our method assigns a pseudo-label in a principled way by constructing an optimization problem.For a given training model that predicts pseudo-labels, the optimization problem finds a solution that maximizes the mutual information (MI) between the pseudo-labels and data while considering the model probability.We formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem and derive the necessary and sufficient condition of solution with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition.This solution can be achieved by fixed-point iteration that we prove the convergence.We remark that MIRA does not require any form of extra training techniques or artificial constraints, e.g., equipartition constraints. Our contributions are summarized as follows:•We propose MIRA, a simple and principled pseudo-label assignment algorithm based on mutual information.Our method does not require extra training techniques or artificial constraints.•We apply MIRA to clustering-based representation learning, showing comparable performance against the state-of-the-art methods with half of the training epochs.Specifically, MIRA achieves 75.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet linear evaluation with only 400 epochs of training and the best performance in 9 out of 11 datasets in transfer learning.•Representation by MIRA also consistently improves over other information-based SSL methods.Especially our method without multi-crop augmentation achieves 74.1% top-1 accuracy and outperforms BarlowTwins Zbontar et al. (2021), a baseline information maximization-based self-supervised method."

What is mutual information means in the paper?,"Mutual information means the mutual dependence between two random variables, which is a measure of how much one variable tells us about the other. In the context of the paper, the mutual information is used to regularize the pseudo-labeling process, by maximizing the mutual information between the pseudo-labels and the data. This is done to ensure that the pseudo-labels are informative and capture the underlying structure of the data",Mutual information between pseudo-label and data without any artificial constraints.,"We argue that such pseudo-labels should maximize the mutual information (MI) between themselves and data while accounting for the model probabilities \bm{P}.Let \mathcal{B}\in\{1,...,B\} and \mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}}\in\{1,...,K\} be the random variables associated with the data index in mini-batch and labels by probability distributions \bm{W}=\{\bm{w}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{B}, respectively.Our online pseudo-label (cluster) assignment is determined by solving the following optimization problem:\displaystyle\bm{W^{*}}\displaystyle=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\bm{W}\subset\Delta_{K}}\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}D_{\text{KL}}(\bm{w}_{i},\bm{p}_{i})-\beta\hat{I}(\mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}};\mathcal{B}),(1)where \Delta_{K}\coloneqq\{\bm{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{K}_{+}\mid\bm{w}^{\intercal}\bm{1}_{K}=1\}, \hat{I} indicates an empirical (Monte Carlo) estimates of MI, and \beta is a trade-off parameter.The problem consists of the (1) KL divergence term that makes pseudo-labels to be based on the model probability \bm{p} and (2) MI term between the pseudo-labels and data to induce more information about data into the pseudo-labels.By combining these two terms, we provide a refined pseudo-label that take account of both the model probability and MI. To make the optimization problem tractable, we substitute the MI term \hat{I} with the mini-batch estimates of the entropy \hat{H}(\mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}}|\mathcal{B}) and marginal entropy \hat{H}(\mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}}) in Eq. 2. We get:\displaystyle\hat{I}(\mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}};\mathcal{B})=\hat{H}(\mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}})-\hat{H}(\mathcal{Y}_{\bm{W}}|\mathcal{B})=-\sum_{j=1}^{K}\bar{w}_{j}\log{\bar{w}_{j}}+\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}\sum_{j=1}^{K}w_{ij}\log{w_{ij}},(2)\displaystyle\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}D_{\text{KL}}(\bm{w}_{i},\bm{p}_{i})=-\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}\sum_{j=1}^{K}w_{ij}\log{p_{ij}}+\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}\sum_{j=1}^{K}w_{ij}\log{w_{ij}},(3)\displaystyle\bm{W^{*}}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\bm{W}\subset\Delta_{K}}-\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}\sum_{j=1}^{K}w_{ij}\log{p_{ij}}+\frac{1-\beta}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}\sum_{j=1}^{K}w_{ij}\log{w_{ij}}+\beta\sum_{j=1}^{K}\overline{w}_{j}\log{\overline{w}_{j}},(4)where \overline{w}_{j}=\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^{B}w_{ij} is the marginal probability of a cluster j with \bm{W}.In practice, we find the optimal point \bm{W}^{*} of the optimization problem Eq. 4 for pseudo-labeling. SeLa Asano et al. (2020) and SwAV Caron et al. (2020) formulate their pseudo-labeling process into optimization problems, i.e., optimal transport (OT) problem, and solve it iteratively with Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm Cuturi (2013).To avoid collapse and apply the SK algorithm, they assume the equipartition of data into clusters.Mathematically, the difference to MIRA is in how to deal with the marginal entropy.SeLa and SwAV constrain the marginal entropy to maximum value–equipartition while MIRA decides it by MI regularization333Adding the equipartition constraint into Eq. 4, our problem converts to the OT problem of SwAV Caron et al. (2020)..Asano et al. (2020) argue that their pseudo-labels with the OT problem maximize the MI between labels and data indices under the equipartition constraint.However, it more resembles assuming MI maximization and then finding the cluster assignments that are optimal transport to the model prediction.In contrast, MIRA directly maximizes the MI by regularization without artificial constraints.While SwAV performs better than SeLa in most self-supervised benchmarks, we verify that MIRA improves over SwAV in various downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose Mutual Information Regularized Assignment (MIRA), a pseudo-labeling algorithm that enables clustering-based SSL without any artificial constraints or extra training techniques.MIRA is designed to follow the infomax principle Linsker (1988) and the intuition that good labels are something that can reduce most of the uncertainty about the data.Our method assigns a pseudo-label in a principled way by constructing an optimization problem.For a given training model that predicts pseudo-labels, the optimization problem finds a solution that maximizes the mutual information (MI) between the pseudo-labels and data while considering the model probability.We formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem and derive the necessary and sufficient condition of solution with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition.This solution can be achieved by fixed-point iteration that we prove the convergence.We remark that MIRA does not require any form of extra training techniques or artificial constraints, e.g., equipartition constraints."

"Why localization, objection detection, and image segmentation downstream tasks are underwhelming?","The underwhelming performance of localization, object detection, and image segmentation downstream tasks is due to the limited representation quality of the clustering-based method, which fails to capture the complex relationships between data points and lacks the ability to handle large-scale datasets","Clustering-based methods relies on pseudo-labels on representation learning. Therefore, our testbed is focused on classification-based benchmark. Object detection is not our main interest.","Meanwhile, a line of work uses clustering for un-/self-supervised representation learning.They explicitly assign pseudo-labels to embedded representation via clustering, and the model is thereby trained to predict such labels.These clustering-based methods can account for inter-data similarity; representations are encouraged to encode the semantic structure of data.Prior works Yang et al.

QNLI and WNLI is a part of GLUE. Is this true? ,Yes,"Yes, both QNLI and WNLI are part of GLUE.","QNLI:Recent submissions on the GLUE leaderboard adopt a pairwise ranking formulation for the QNLI task, in which candidate answers are mined from the training set and compared to one another, and a single (question, candidate) pair is classified as positive Liu et al.

How NSP plays a role in BERT?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

NSP helps BERT learn document context and improve its ability to distinguish between contiguous and non-contiguous text",NSP helps to improve the ability of distinguishing  the observed document segments come from the same or distinct documents in BERT.,"In the original BERT pretraining procedure, the model observes two concatenated document segments, which are either sampled contiguously from the same document (with p=0.5) or from distinct documents.In addition to the masked language modeling objective, the model is trained to predict whether the observed document segments come from the same or distinct documents via an auxiliary Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) loss."

What is the difference between BERT paper and RoBERTa paper’s point of views? Give an answer in NSP loss and their performance perspective.,"Sure, here's the answer to your question:

The main difference between the BERT paper and the RoBERTa paper's point of views on NSP loss is that the RoBERTa paper questions the necessity of the NSP loss for downstream task performance, while the BERT paper hypothesizes that the NSP loss is important for training the original BERT model.

In terms of performance, the RoBERTa paper finds that removing the NSP loss and training with blocks of text from a single document (doc-sentences) outperforms the originally published BERT{}_{\textsc{base}} results, while the BERT paper observes significant performance degradation on QNLI, MNLI, and SQuAD 1.1 when removing the NSP loss","In BERT paper, author said that removing NSP can hurt the performance of the model. However, in RoBERTa paper, author said that removing NSP improves downstream task performance. Therefore, point of views in terms of NSP is different between BERT and RoBERTa.","The NSP loss was hypothesized to be an important factor in training the original BERT model. Devlin et al. (2019) observe that removing NSP hurts performance, with significant performance degradation on QNLI, MNLI, and SQuAD 1.1.However, some recent work has questioned the necessity of the NSP loss Lample and Conneau (2019); Yang et al. (2019); Joshi et al. (2019). We next compare training without the NSP loss and training with blocks of text from a single document (doc-sentences).We find that this setting outperforms the originally published BERT{}_{\textsc{base}} results and that removing the NSP loss matches or slightly improves downstream task performance, in contrast to Devlin et al. (2019).It is possible that the original BERT implementation may only have removed the loss term while still retaining the segment-pair input format."

How many tokens are changed to [MASK] in BERT training? Give a ratio.,"80% of the selected tokens are changed to [MASK], or 12% of all tokens in the input sequence (80% of 15% is 12%)",80% of tokens are replaced with [MASK] during training.,"A random sample of the tokens in the input sequence is selected and replaced with the special token [\mathit{MASK}].

Of the selected tokens, 80% are replaced with [\mathit{MASK}], 10% are left unchanged, and 10% are replaced by a randomly selected vocabulary token."
RoBERTa uses large batch size. How many times larger than BERT-large one?,RoBERTa uses a batch size that is approximately 8 times larger than BERT-large,"RoBERTa use 32 times larger batch size than BERT because batch size of BERT and RoBERTa are 256 and 8K, respectively.","Devlin et al. (2019) originally trained BERT{}_{\textsc{base}} for 1M steps with a batch size of 256 sequences.This is equivalent in computational cost, via gradient accumulation, to training for 125K steps with a batch size of 2K sequences, or for 31K steps with a batch size of 8K. In Table 3 we compare perplexity and end-task performance of BERT{}_{\textsc{base}} as we increase the batch size, controlling for the number of passes through the training data.We observe that training with large batches improves perplexity for the masked language modeling objective, as well as end-task accuracy.Large batches are also easier to parallelize via distributed data parallel training,888Large batch training can improve training efficiency even without large scale parallel hardware through gradient accumulation, whereby gradients from multiple mini-batches are accumulated locally before each optimization step. This functionality is supported natively in fairseq Ott et al. (2019). and in later experiments we train with batches of 8K sequences."
Why RoBERTa uses Dynamic masking rather than Static masking?,RoBERTa uses dynamic masking instead of static masking to improve the diversity of the masked tokens during training,They use dynamic masking to avoid using the same mask in iteration.,"As discussed in Section 2, BERT relies on randomly masking and predicting tokens.The original BERT implementation performed masking once during data preprocessing, resulting in a single static mask.To avoid using the same mask for each training instance in every epoch, training data was duplicated 10 times so that each sequence is masked in 10 different ways over the 40 epochs of training.Thus, each training sequence was seen with the same mask four times during training."
Why author said that “the data used for pretraining” have been under-emphesized?

Training is computationally expensive, limiting the amount of tuning that can be done, and is often done with private training data of varying sizes, limiting our ability to measure the effects of the modeling advances."
Explain the author’s motivation to make CC-News dataset.,"Sure! Here's the answer to the question at the end of the context:

The author's motivation to create the CC-News dataset is to gather as much data as possible for experimentation, in order to match the overall quality and quantity of data used in other studies that have trained on larger and more diverse datasets than the original BERT",The motivation of making CC-News dataset is most additional datasets in previous works are not available.,"BERT-style pretraining crucially relies on large quantities of text. Baevski et al. (2019) demonstrate that increasing data size can result in improved end-task performance. Several efforts have trained on datasets larger and more diverse than the original BERT Radford et al. (2019); Yang et al. (2019); Zellers et al. (2019).Unfortunately, not all of the additional datasets can be publicly released. For our study, we focus on gathering as much data as possible for experimentation, allowing us to match the overall quality and quantity of data as appropriate for each comparison."
"Does RoBERTa also takes as input a concatenation of two segments, as well as BERT did?",No,"RoBERTa takes concatenated four sequence ,candidate answer with the corresponding question and passage, input not like BERT.","We modify RoBERTa for this task by concatenating each candidate answer with the corresponding question and passage.We then encode each of these four sequences and pass the resulting [CLS] representations through a fully-connected layer, which is used to predict the correct answer.We truncate question-answer pairs that are longer than 128 tokens and, if needed, the passage so that the total length is at most 512 tokens."
BERT originally trained with a batch size of 256 sequences and RoBERTa simply followed that. Is this true? ,No,"No, they used bigger batch size than BERT.","We present a replication study of BERT pretraining Devlin et al. (2019), which includes a careful evaluation of the effects of hyperparmeter tuning and training set size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained and propose an improved recipe for training BERT models, which we call RoBERTa, that can match or exceed the performance of all of the post-BERT methods.Our modifications are simple, they include: (1) training the model longer, with bigger batches, over more data; (2) removing the next sentence prediction objective; (3) training on longer sequences; and (4) dynamically changing the masking pattern applied to the training data. We also collect a large new dataset (CC-News) of comparable size to other privately used datasets, to better control for training set size effects."
Why does zero-shot evaluation has been suggested as a genuine measure for reasoning capability?,"Zero-shot evaluation has been suggested as a genuine measure for reasoning capability because existing datasets only test individual aspects of commonsense reasoning, and large-scale neural systems have been criticized for solving these datasets rather than learning general semantic reasoning",It is hard to measure reasoning capability using individual datasets because the model cannot learn how to perform general semantic reasoning.,"The ability to understand natural language through commonsense reasoning is one of the core focuses in the field of natural language processing. To measure and study the different aspects of commonsense reasoning, several datasets are developed, such as SocialIQA (Sap et al., 2019b), CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018), and PhysicalIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), each requiring different type of commonsense knowledge (e.g., social, taxonomic, causal, declarative, etc) to select the correct answer. While large-scale neural systems (Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019b) have shown human-level accuracy on these benchmarks, recent studies (Mitra et al., 2019) also criticize that these models solve individual datasets, rather than learning how to perform general semantic reasoning. To this end, Ma et al. (2021) suggested zero-shot evaluation as a genuine measure for the reasoning capability of the machine."
What is AdapterFusion?,"AdapterFusion is a method for fusing task-specific parameters (adapters) trained independently for each task in a non-destructive manner, mitigating issues such as forgetting and interference between tasks",AdapterFusion is one of the multi-task learning method based on attention-like mechanism. It aggregates pre-trained adapters in a non-destructive manner mitigating catastrophic forgetting and interference between tasks.,"To address these limitations, we propose a novel, modularized framework that aims to learn multiple expert models for KGs, then conduct zero-shot fusion to allow collaboration among KGs. For this purpose, we leverage AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) where multiple tiny modules between Transformer blocks called adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019) can be combined after independent training, thus allowing a continual integration of the adapters without retraining the entire framework. Specifically, we treat the adapters as different KG-specific experts, and combine them using an attention-like fusion module. To improve the fusion of adapters, we suggest a KG-alignment adapter that guides to the apt expert adapters. Here, we use KGs in three different synthetic supervision training: (1) KG-specific QA datasets to train the KG-specific expert adapters, (2) a KG classification datasets to train the KG-alignment adapter, and (3) a balanced mixture of KG-specific QA datasets to train the fusion module. Our modularized method alleviates the interference between different KGs, which is the pitfall of MTL from our empirical observation, and thus combines multiple KGs into a synergetic zero-shot framework. To address this problem, AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) has been proposed to fuse task specific parameters called adapters for the given target task leveraging attention-like mechanism. AdapterFusion aggregates adapters, which is trained independently for each task, in a non-destructive manner mitigating aforementioned MTL problems such as forgetting and interference between tasks. Recently, it has been used for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer framework (Pfeiffer et al., 2020c; Wang et al., 2021b), which motivates our work to transfer multi-source knowledge with less interference for zero-shot commonsense reasoning."
How do the authors generate synthetic QA?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The authors generate synthetic QA by transforming entities and relations in a knowledge graph (KG) into natural language questions using templates, and then combining the correct answer with distractors from other triples sampled randomly","They generate syntheticQS by transforming a triplet of KG into question and answer pair. Specifically, they transform the head entity and relation into question and tail entity into an answer using templates.","In our setup, we repurpose synthetic QA generation (Ma et al., 2021) for the task of knowledge-driven zero-shot learning for commonsense reasoning, i.e., we transform a KG into multiple (Q_{i},A_{i}) pairs where Q_{i} is a natural language question and A_{i}=\{A_{i,1},...,A_{i,m}\} is the set of options with m answer candidates. Specifically, given a triple (e^{head},r,e^{tail}) in a KG, where e^{head}, e^{tail} and r denote head/tail entity and relation respectively, we transform e^{head} and r into a natural language question Q_{i} using templates. For the option set A_{i}, we use the combination of the correct answer e^{tail} and m-1 distractors which are tail entities from other triples sampled randomly (Ma et al., 2021). Details are described in Appendix B."
What is the main weak point of conventional Multi-task learning for zero-shot learning with multiple types of commonsense knowledge? ,interference among different knowledge graphs (KGs) leading to forgetting previously learned knowledge when training on new KGs,"Conventional Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is known to be prone to interference between various tasks, as well as a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting, wherein the model struggles to retain knowledge of different types acquired during MTL.","To consider different types of reasoning, this paper extends ideas from the aforementioned zero-shot learning to the multi-source case such that it benefits from different types of commonsense knowledge on individual KGs. For example, ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019a) focuses on social commonsense while ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) contains conceptual knowledge. A practical approach is multi-task learning (MTL; Caruana, 1997; Liu et al., 2019a), which learns a shared encoder for different synthetic QA datasets from multiple KGs. Despite its effectiveness, MTL scheme suffers from interference among different KGs, which results in forgetting previously learned knowledge when trained on new KG which has different kinds of knowledge (Pilault et al., 2021; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a; Wu et al., 2020). MTL (Liu et al., 2019a; Zhang and Yang, 2017; Caruana, 1997) learns a shared representation while aggregating knowledge across multiple learning tasks, often leading to better generalization ability of a model. However, parametric aggregation of knowledge with MTL has following limitations: (1) retraining the full model when adding new tasks (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2021, 2020b) (2) catastrophic forgetting and interference between tasks leading to difficulties of solving each task equally well (Pilault et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020) and (3) inconsistent effect (Lourie et al., 2021). To deal with these challenges, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a parameterized generalization of ensembling techniques, which has been adapted for MTL with gating network trained to optimize each task (Ma et al., 2018). However, simple linear gating networks are too shallow and thus may destruct task knowledge for commonsense reasoning."
Why is KG Modularization needed?,"To preserve the intrinsic knowledge of each Knowledge Graph (KG) and avoid interference between them, KG modularization is necessary","KG modularization is crucial for maintaining the intrinsic knowledge of each individual KG. As the selection and alignment of an appropriate KG has been shown to have a significant impact on downstream tasks, it is important that the model is able to learn the subtle differences between each KG without any interference from other KGs.","First, we modularize the KGs to preserve their intrinsic knowledge. Considering the importance of using a suitable and well-aligned KG (Ma et al., 2019, 2021) on a downstream task, the subtle difference between each KG should be learned by the model without any interference from each other. Accordingly, we adopt the adapter module (Houlsby et al., 2019) which repurposes a pre- trained language model (PLM) to incorporate each KG as tiny modules in between Transformer blocks. Specifically, as illustrated in Figure 2 (except for green area), the adapter training strategy involves injecting new layers (parameterized by Φ) into the original PLM (parameterized by θ). The weights of the original PLM are untouched, while the new adapter layers are initialized at random. Formally, we call each adapter trained with DkQA as an expert adapter for KG k, parameterized by ΦkQA."
What are the advantages of KG modularization using adapters?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Scalability and separate storage of knowledge",Adapter enables to store the corresponding knowledge separately without any interference. We can parallelize the training of the adapter for all KGs. The efficiency of adapter training allows our modularization to be more scalable.,"where KG-invariant parameters θ are fixed and only KG-dependent parameters Φk QA are learned, which enables to store the corresponding knowledge separately without any interference. Further, we can parallelize the training of the adapter for all KGs. The efficiency of adapter training allows our modularization to be more scalable."
How does the author show the mitigation of interference?,"By presenting the interference ratio of the models on five benchmark datasets, which shows that the author's method achieves a substantially better ratio, especially when the KG-C adapter is used, demonstrating the efficacy of the framework in mitigating interference between knowledge",Use interference ratio.,"Using the interference ratio, we can precisely compare the negative effects of multi-KG models on knowledge aggregation since the only reason to get the correct samples wrong is the interference caused by learning with additional KGs. We present the interference ratio of the models on five benchmark datasets in Figure 5. This figure shows that MTL has the higher interference ratio than the competing models across all benchmarks. Our method achieves a substantially better ratio, especially when KG-C adapter is used. This demonstrates the efficacy of our framework in mitigating interference between knowledge, which is one of the major problems of MTL."
What is the difference between zero-shot fusion and original AdapterFusion?,"Zero-shot fusion aims to generalize the transfer of knowledge to any arbitrary target task, whereas AdapterFusion focuses on learning to transfer knowledge to a specific target task","In contrast to AdapterFusion where the focus is learning to transfer knowledge to a specific target task, our zero-shot fusion aims to generalize this transfer to any arbitrary target task.","Once the expert adapters are learned, we combine the knowledge from each expert adapter using an attention-like mechanism. We present a novel fusion strategy as shown in Figure 2, which is referred to as the zero-shot fusion. In contrast to AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) where the focus islearning to transfer knowledge to a specific targettask, our zero-shot fusion aims to generalize this transfer to any arbitrary target task. Specifically, the zero-shot fusion parameters Ψ learn to combine fixed expert adapters which are parameterized by Φ_1 QA, ..., Φ K QA. In each Transformer layer l of PLM with the injected fusion layer, the zero-shot fusion parameters ΨQA consist of query, key, and value matrices, denoted by WQ_l, WK_l, and WV_l respectively. These parameters are used to learn the balancing between the representation of each expert adapters through attention-like mechanism. While fixing both the parameters θ and all expert adapters Φ_1 QA, ..., Φ_K QA, the only trainable weights ΨQA on the fusion layer learns to combine the knowledge from different K expert adapters by using the subset of {Dk QA} K k=1 by random sampling. Here, we balance the ratio between the K knowledge-driven datasets as N samples (details are in Appendix D)."
Which dataset is used for fusion layer training?,A balanced mixture of KG-specific QA datasets,a balanced mixture of KG-specific QA datasets to train the fusion module.,"To address these limitations, we propose a novel, modularized framework that aims to learn multiple expert models for KGs, then conduct zero-shot fusion to allow collaboration among KGs.

Specifically, we treat the adapters as different KG-specific experts, and combine them using an attention-like fusion module. To improve the fusion of adapters, we suggest a KG-alignment adapter that guides to the apt expert adapters. Here, we use KGs in three different synthetic supervision training: (1) KG-specific QA datasets to train the KG-specific expert adapters, (2) a KG classification datasets to train the KG-alignment adapter, and (3) a balanced mixture of KG-specific QA datasets to train the fusion module. Our modularized method alleviates the interference between different KGs, which is the pitfall of MTL from our empirical observation, and thus combines multiple KGs into a synergetic zero-shot framework."
Why is KG-Classifier adapter suggested?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

KG-Classifier adapter is suggested because it leverages the knowledge graph embeddings learned during pre-training to improve the performance of the downstream task, even in the zero-shot setting","To compensate that usage a mixture of synthetic QA for fusion training, which is not exactly a training task.","AdapterFusion uses the PLM hidden representation h^l_P LM as a query which is learned when training on a specific downstream task. In our zero-shot setting, however, we use a mixture of synthetic QA for fusion training, which is not exactly a training"
Which dataset is used for KG-Classifier adapter training?,DKGC (KG Classification dataset),"For KG-Classifier adapter training, KG classification dataset has been used. This dataset is generate by transforming a QA sample into a KG classification sample, using the concatenation of question and answer of synthetic QA as a question and the KG source as an answer.","To address these limitations, we propose a novel, modularized framework that aims to learn multiple expert models for KGs, then conduct zero-shot fusion to allow collaboration among KGs.

Paragraph10 : Specifically, we propose a novel training task for KG-Classifier adapter, which requires predicting the KG for the given sample of the task. For that, given {Dk_QA} K k=1, we first transform a QA sample (Qi, Ai) into a new KG classification sample [Qi; Ai,label] where [; ] is the concatenation. Then, we obtain a new label yi ∈ {0, 1} K indicating the corresponding KG source. The samples are in Appendix E. Formally, KG classification dataset DKGC is defined as: DKGC = {([Qi ; Ai,label], yi)} M_i=1 (9) where M is the total size of {Dk QA} K k=1."
Which benchmark has been used for evaluation?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Five question-answering benchmarks for commonsense","We evaluate our proposed framework on five question-answering benchmarks for commonsense reasoning: SocialIQA (SIQA) (Sap et al., 2019b), CommonsenseQA (CSQA) (Talmor et al., 2018), Abductive NLI (a-NLI) (Bhagavatula et al., 2020), PhysicalIQA (PIQA) (Bisk et al., 2020), and WinoGrande (WG) (Sakaguchi et al., 2020).",We evaluate our proposed framework on five question-answering benchmarks for commonsense
What does STL stand for?,STL stands for Single-Task Learning,Single-Task Learning (STL): The model is pre-trained on a synthetic QA dataset generated from a single KG.,"Single-Task Learning (STL): The model is pre-trained on a synthetic QA dataset generated from a single KG. Specifically, we experiment two architectural choices: PLM (STLPLM) and PLM with adapters (STL-Adapter). For each architecture, there are four STL models for each of synthetic QA datasets derived from ATOMIC, ConceptNet, WikiData, and WordNet. We note that the trained STLAdapter is an expert adapter from a specific KG in our framework. The performance of each STL baseline is shown in Appendix I Table 9 and Table 10."
What is the difference in test results according to the presence or absence of adapters?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The presence of the KG-C adapter improves the test results by 0.4% on average",KG-C adapter improves the average accuracy of zero-shot fusion by 0.4%,"Moreover, as an ablation, we compare the zeroshot fusion with and without KG-C adapter to explore the efficacy of the KG-C adapter. We can observe that zero-shot fusion with KG-C adapter improves the average accuracy by 0.4%, which implies that the use of KG-C adapter improves the overall performance and makes our method generalize better on most of the evaluation benchmarks."
How does KG-Classifier affect zero-shot fusion?,"KG-Classifier affects zero-shot fusion by enabling the delicate balancing between multiple knowledge sources based on KG-alignment awareness, leading to performance improvements in commonsense reasoning tasks",zero-shot fusion with KG-C adapter fuses the knowledge from different experts with a subtle difference rather than focusing on a single expert severely.,"Further, we explore how the KG-C adapter affects zero-shot fusion which is based on an attention-like mechanism (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) compared to zero-shot fusion without KG-C adapter. Here, while zero-shot fusion without KGC adapter simply uses the representation of PLM as a query, zero-shot fusion with KG-C adapter leverages the representation of KG-C adapter. To illustrate this strength, we visualize the attention probability of [CLS] token from each fusion layer as a representative in Figure 4. The column of the darker cell indicates the adapter that has the bigger influence on the fused representation. We can observe that zero-shot fusion with KG-C adapter fuses the knowledge from different experts with a subtle difference rather than focusing on a single expert severely. This implies that KG-C adapter enables the delicate balancing between multiple knowledge sources based on the KG-alignment awareness, which leads to performance improvements in commonsense reasoning tasks. Interestingly, both cases have the ability not to focus on the expert adapter based on WikiData, which can be seen as a redundant expert.4 This observation would benefit from the further study that explores the optimal combination of KGs by expert selection or rejection."
What is the correlation between the number of KGs and the performance when using zero-shot fusion?,"Sure! Here's the answer based on the given context:

POSITIVE CORRELATION",Zero-shot fusion obtains relative performance improvement across most of benchmark when more KGs are utilized for training.,"In Figure 6, while the MTL tends to show the decrease of the performance when more KGs are utilized for training, our method obtains relative performance improvement across most of benchmarks. In both framework, the slightly degraded performance of the combination of KGs without ATOMIC could be due to the strong alignment between ATOMIC and SIQA. Except for the above case, we can observe that as more KGs are leveraged, the color of the cell gets greener, which implies that our method gains more advantages for better performance. This demonstrates that our method enables knowledge aggregation for multiple KGs synergetically."
Why is neural integration of different KGs better than symbolic KG integration?,"Neural integration of different KGs is better than symbolic KG integration because it does not require additional processing and alignment information between KGs, allowing for the integration of a larger number of triples and relations without losing knowledge","Rather than such symbolic KG integration with the inevitable loss of knowledge, in this work, we explore the neural KG integration leveraging the multiple KGs without additional processing and alignment information between KG and task.","However, most of existing work are either assuming the existence of the alignment information between tasks and KGs (Banerjee and Baral, 2020) or an integrated KG (Ma et al., 2021). For example, \texttt{ATOMIC}^{20}_{20} (Hwang et al., 2021), a commonsense KG which incorporates tuples from ConceptNet and ATOMIC with new relations and further crowdsourcing, combines multiple KGs into a new integrated KG, but as widely known (Ilievski et al., 2020; Hwang et al., 2021), heterogeneous schema between different KGs may limit triplets that can be integrated.111Only 172K tuples of the 3.4M tuples and 5 relations of 36 relations in ConceptNet are integrated into \texttt{ATOMIC}^{20}_{20}. Rather than such symbolic KG integration with the inevitable loss of knowledge, in this work, we explore the neural KG integration leveraging the multiple KGs without additional processing and alignment information between KG and task."

How does the authors claim that the proposed method could improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff over existing SoTA CNN models?,"By directly incorporating the target latency into the loss function during the search process, the proposed NAS method can find a baseline network that is optimized for both accuracy and latency on a specific NPU. Additionally, the post-processing step that adds SE blocks and h-swish activation functions can further improve the accuracy of the model while maintaining the latency",They compared their network with state-of-the-art models in Table 6. Table 6 shows that the baseline model achieved higher accuracy than comparisons with similar latency.,"We apply the proposed NAS method with the supernet architecture described above. The depth of 5 stages is set to 3,4,7,4,11, respectively. The latency constraint is set to 2.5 ms that corresponds to the latency of EfficientNet-B1 on our target NPU, MIDAP. Table 6 compares our search results with the state-of-the-art models: EdgeTPU (Gupta and Akin, 2020), EfficientNet (Tan and Le, 2019a), Once-For-All (Cai et al., 2019). The latency of the other models is obtained by running the network on the MIDAP cycle-accurate simulator. We compare the accuracy without quantization, assuming that quantization effects will be similar to all models. As shown in Table 6, the baseline model, ours-M, found by the proposed NAS technique has higher accuracy than the other models on our target NPU; ours-M achieves more than 1.7% higher top-1 accuracy than EfficientNet-lite2 with similar latency. Moreover, it is 0.5% higher than EfficientNet-B1, even without using SE and h-swish activation function. Note that the number of parameters and the number of FLOPS in ours-M is larger than EfficientNet-B1. It implies that the complexity of the network is not a direct indicator of the end-to-end latency of the network. The end-to-end latency depends on the NPU architecture, and the proposed NAS technique could find a larger network with shorter latency by adding the latency factor to the loss function directly. The main benefit comes from different block assignment to stages. Finally, we selectively removed SE blocks from ours-XL+, resulting in ours-XL-rmSE+. We collected the activation values using randomly sampled 10K images from the training dataset and calculated the metric explained in Sec. 4.3.3.After removing SE blocks from ours-XL+ based on the metric, only about 60% of the blocks in the network have SE blocks. As a result, we could make the latency shorter, while the accuracy was slightly improved than ours-XL+. This model achieves 82.72% top-1 accuracy with only 11.66ms latency.It is much better than EfficientNet-EdgeTPU-L (Gupta and Akin, 2020) that achieves 80.62% FP32 top-1 accuracy with more than 20ms on EdgeTPU. Our architecture on MIDAP is about 2 times faster with 2.1% higher accuracy. In this work, we propose a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology extending the Single-Path NAS technique (Stamoulis et al., 2019). We modify the supernet architecture by varying the number of blocks in stages and adding mixed depthwise convolution (Tan and Le, 2019b) to the search space. By modifying the loss function to directly include the target latency estimated by a cycle-accurate simulator of the target NPU, we could find a better baseline architecture with a shorter latency than the latency constraint. Using a tight latency constraint, we can reduce the search space to find the baseline network fast. Afterward, we apply compound scaling to find a larger network than the baseline network, and add SE blocks and h-swish activation functions in the post-processing step.Through the proposed NAS methodology, we could obtain a network with 82.72% accuracy with 11.66ms latency on our target NPU, without special data augmentation in training. It dominates the existing network models on the target NPU. It confirms the importance of supernet architecture design for a given NPU and effectiveness of the three-step approach in the proposed NAS methodology: supernet design, SinglePath NAS with a tighter latency constraint, and compound scaling and post-processing. Experiments show that the proposed NAS technique could improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff over existing SoTA CNN models. Our best model achieves 82.72% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 11.66ms latency without any special data augmentation. Note that the latency is estimated by cycle-accurate simulation. For a fair comparison with the related work, the latency of each compared network is also estimated with the same simulator."
What is the contribution of this paper?,"The contribution of this paper is a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology that extends the Single-Path NAS technique with a tighter latency constraint and compound scaling, leading to a network with high accuracy and low latency on the target NPU","They modify the supernet architecture by varying the number of blocks in stages, and adds MixConv to the search space.

Since it enables us to make a fully static schedule of operations without resource contention in the data path, we can estimate the end-to-end latency of a CNN quite accurately analytically. Unexpected delay may incur from off-chip DRAM delay that is not fully hidden by double buffering. Figure 6 depicts our building block structure. This block starts and ends with 1×1 convolution, with N searchable superkernels in the middle. Each searchable superkernel is designed similarly to Eq. (3), while we may use different threshold values in each superkernel. The kernel sizes and expansion ratios are selected among predetermined values. If the j-th searchable superkernel chooses an expansion ratio e_{j}, the j-th kernel has e_{j} times more channels than the first 1×1 convolution. Compared with the original MixConv suggested in (Tan and Le, 2019b), the proposed building block supports more diverse combinations of kernel sizes and expansion ratios. It enhances the efficiency of search results on our target NPU (Table 5). We propose to modify the loss function to activate the latency-aware loss term only when the estimated latency is larger than the latency constraint as follows:(9)CE+\lambda_{1}\cdot log(1+\lambda_{2}\cdot ReLU((\sum L)-T))Although this is not a panacea, this modification significantly eases the search process, which will be discussed in section 5.2 with various experiments. Figure 11 depicts an example distribution of activation values produced by two different SE blocks for three different images. The authors of the original paper (Hu et al., 2018) conjectured that if such distribution from a SE block does not differ widely between image classes, the SE block is not important. Thus, after training, they obtained averaged activation values of a SE block over multiple images in the same class.They compared the distributions of the averaged values over different image classes. They observed that removing the SE blocks that have similar distributions over different image classes incurs only a marginal loss in accuracy.

Why focusing on latency-aware NAS is important?,"Focusing on latency-aware NAS is important because it can find a larger network with shorter latency by directly adding the latency factor to the loss function, and the number of MAC operations is not a proper measure of latency","Other criteria, such as complexity of the network or the number of MAC operations, is not a proper measure of latency.

The main benefit comes from different block assignment to stages. One of the most closely related work is the recently proposed NAS technique tailored for Google’s Edge-TPU [9]. While MBConv is widely used for GPU-aware NAS techniques, they prefer to use a single full convolution by fusing expansion layer and DWConv layer in some parts of the network, observing that the Edge-TPU runs the fused full convolution faster even though the required number of MAC (multiply-accumulate) operations is much larger. It confirms that the number of MAC operations is not a proper measure of latency, and platform-specific performance estimation is required."
"How ""superkernel"" is different from supernet?
","Superkernel and supernet are different in their purpose and composition.

A superkernel is a single, reusable component in a neural network architecture, consisting of a set of convolutional layers with a specific kernel size and expansion ratio.

On the other hand, a supernet is a pre-trained neural network that serves as a search space for a NAS technique, containing multiple possible network architectures with different topologies and parameters",A superkernel is a component for searching expansion ratio and kernel sizes. Supernet defines the largest network we can search.,"Figure 6 depicts our building block structure. This block starts and ends with 1×1 convolution, with N searchable superkernels in the middle. Each searchable superkernel is designed similarly to Eq. (3), while we may use different threshold values in each superkernel. The kernel sizes and expansion ratios are selected among predetermined values. If the j-th searchable superkernel chooses an expansion ratio e_{j}, the j-th kernel has e_{j} times more channels than the first 1×1 convolution. Compared with the original MixConv suggested in (Tan and Le, 2019b), the proposed building block supports more diverse combinations of kernel sizes and expansion ratios. It enhances the efficiency of search results on our target NPU (Table 5). A superkernel has two parameters to search: expansion ratio and kernel size. To limit the search space, we choose the expansion ratio among 0, 2, 4, and 6, and the kernel size between 3 and 5 when MBConv or full convolution is used as the building block. In the case of the MixConv-based building block, we use N=3 superkenels whose expansion ratio is 0 or 2; The sum of the expansion ratio of three superkernels has the same range as the expansion ratio of a single MBConv block. To allow three superkernels to have different kernel sizes, we let one of three superkernels be able to have 7 as the kernel size. A NAS technique explores a predefined search space and estimates the performance for each candidate architecture to find an optimal one with the highest accuracy under a given latency constraint. Thus there are three factors that affect the performance of NAS, as shown in Figure 1: search space, search strategy, and performance estimation. The search space of a NAS technique is usually restricted by a supernet that defines the topology of the largest network to explore. Since the performance of a network depends on the hardware platform, the NAS technique needs to be customized to a given hardware platform. While numerous NAS techniques have been proposed with various search strategies recently, their assumed hardware platforms are mostly GPUs. In this paper, we present a customized NAS technique for an NPU, which produces a CNN architecture with a better accuracy-latency tradeoff than existing models."
Why did the authors choose MIDAP as the target NPU to experiment on?,The authors chose MIDAP as the target NPU because it has a fully-pipelined micro-architecture that allows for accurate end-to-end latency estimation and supports a variety of operations that can lower MAC utilization,"The end-to-end latency can be estimated quite accurately, and MIDAP can efficiently support which which lower the MAC utilization in other NPUs.","Even though the proposed methodology can be applied to any type of NPU, the current implementation is made for an adder-tree type NPU, called MIDAP (Kanget al., 2019).It has a fully-pipelined micro-architecture that consists of separate hardware modules and memory modules for convolution, activation function, and various reduction operations.

How does the authors select SE blocks to remove?,The authors select SE blocks to remove based on the diverseness of the activation distribution over different images. They calculate the standard deviation of activation values over different channels and use it as a metric to determine which SE blocks to remove,"Removing SE blocks having similar distributions over different image classes are known to incur only a marginal loss in accuracy. Thus, for each channel c, authors calculated the standard deviation \sigma_{c} of activation values over different images. Small value of \sigma_{c} would mean that SE block is having similar distrubution over different images. Thus they defined the metric as the average of \sigma_{c} over all channels. Specifically, they sample from 10K images from the training dataset, and remove until only about 60% of blocks are remained.","Figure 11 depicts an example distribution of activation values produced by two different SE blocks for three different images. The authors of the original paper (Hu et al., 2018) conjectured that if such distribution from a SE block does not differ widely between image classes, the SE block is not important. Thus, after training, they obtained averaged activation values of a SE block over multiple images in the same class.They compared the distributions of the averaged values over different image classes. They observed that removing the SE blocks that have similar distributions over different image classes incurs only a marginal loss in accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose to remove SE blocks selectively to minimize the additional computation cost caused by SE blocks.We obtain activation values from a SE block for each input image and measure how the distribution of activation values varies over different input images.For each channel c, we calculate the standard deviation \sigma_{c} of activation values over different images. If \sigma_{c} is small in most channels, the activation values from the SE block does not differ much over images. Conceptually, it implies that the SE block does not help to discriminate further which channel is more influential. From the engineering perspective, it means that channel-wise multiplication of a SE block is similar to constant multiplication, which can be handled by the following convolutional layer. We define a metric as the average of standard deviation values \sigma_{c} over all channels that represent the diverseness of the activation distribution over different images. If the metric value is small, we remove the SE block. For example, in Figure 11, our metric of the SE block on the left side has a value of 0.021, while the right side has a value of 0.118, more than 5x larger than the left side; The left side is a better candidate for SE block removal. When we remove SE blocks according to this metric, the accuracy is found to be similar, while the latency got shorter (Table 6). Finally, we selectively removed SE blocks from ours-XL+, resulting in ours-XL-rmSE+. We collected the activation values using randomly sampled 10K images from the training dataset and calculated the metric explained in Sec. 4.3.3.After removing SE blocks from ours-XL+ based on the metric, only about 60% of the blocks in the network have SE blocks. As a result, we could make the latency shorter, while the accuracy was slightly improved than ours-XL+. This model achieves 82.72% top-1 accuracy with only 11.66ms latency.It is much better than EfficientNet-EdgeTPU-L (Gupta and Akin, 2020) that achieves 80.62% FP32 top-1 accuracy with more than 20ms on EdgeTPU.

"How does authors verify that searching in a small supernet then scaling is good tactic to search a big network?
","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The authors verify that searching in a small supernet and then scaling is a good tactic to search for a big network by comparing the performance of the scaled network with the direct search results","Searching in a small supernet then scaling was better than directly searching in a big supernet; The accuracy was similar, but the direct search needed much higher search cost.","There are two methods to find an architecture with a loose latency constraint. One is to use compound scaling that scales a small network with shorter latency, and the other is to search a network directly. To compare these two methods,we first scaled ours-M using the same scaling coefficients that we used to scale ours-M+ to ours-L+ and trained it. When conducting a direct search, we scaled the depth and width of the supernet and the input image size first and applied the proposed NAS technique for the scaled supernet. We used batch size 512 instead of 1024 during the architecture search due to the memory limitation of TPU. The comparison result is shown in Table 7 in terms of top-1 accuracy(%) and the latency on the target NPU(ms).Two results were similar while direct search needed 10 hours on TPUv3; It means that compound scaling is an effective method to find a large network fast."
Why does author experiment the quantized linear supernet design even though Radosavovic et al. already provided similar result?,To further enhance the efficiency of the search result,"The previous study shows the linear design is beneficial in terms of computational complexity, while the author shows the result in terms of latency.","Thus, we place more blocks to stages with larger width in the supernet, making the cumulative depth up to a specific stage is proportional to the width of the stage, which is similar to PyramidNet (Han et al., 2017). A recent study (Radosavovic et al., 2020) also claims that neural architectures with a linear relationship between the cumulative depth and the width tend to have higher accuracy with a similar amount of computation complexity. Our experiment shows that our modification to supernet enhances the efficiency of the search result in terms of accuracy as well as latency (Table 4)."
How does authors claim that squeeze-and-excitation block removal is beneficial?,"By observing that similar distribution of activation values from SE blocks across different image classes indicates that the blocks are not important, and removing them incurs only a marginal loss in accuracy","Previous work shows the potential of removing SE blocks, and authors confirms the benefit of removal with an experimental result.","Figure 11 depicts an example distribution of activation values produced by two different SE blocks for three different images.

Is the extended search strategy beneficial? Does the gain simply come from modified search space?,"No.

The extended search strategy does not appear to be beneficial in this case, as the random search and random selection methods, which have a simpler search strategy, are able to achieve similar performance to the proposed technique. The gain does not seem to come from the modified search space, but rather from the specific architecture of the supernet",The randomly searched network on the same supernet could not outperform the proposed result with Single-Path NAS. Thus the search strategy was beneficial.,"While most NAS techniques are not compared with a random search method, the authors (Li and Talwalkar, 2019) reported that a random search method is highly competitive. So we conducted an experiment to compare the proposed NAS technique with two random search methods, exploring the same search space defined by the supernet structure of ours-M.First, we designed a simple random search method that has the similar time complexity of the proposed technique. In this method, we randomly generate 15 models having a similar latency with ours-M, from the same search space. Then we train each of them for 1 epoch with cosine learning rate decay. After evaluating each of them, we choose the architecture with the topmost top-1 accuracy and fully train it. In the second method, called random selection, we randomly generate 20 models having a similar latency with ours-M and train them fully and take the architecture with the highest top-1 accuracy. Since the random selection method performs search and training simultaneously, it is slower than the proposed technique by the number of randomly generated models. Comparison results are reported in Table 6. It is confirmed that both random selection and random search are quite competitive, but noticeably inferior to ours-M in terms of accuracy.In detail, the worst case of random selection showed 0.8% lower accuracy than ours-M. The best performance obtained from 20 randomly generated models is 79.19%, still lower than the accuracy of ours-M.Note that random search and random selection show similar performance that is no smaller than the other networks. It means that the search space defined by the supernet architecture has a more significant effect on the accuracy than the search method."
"How the proposed loss function is different from that of original Single-Path NAS?
","The proposed loss function includes a target latency term, which is not present in the original Single-Path NAS loss function","Previous method needs additional search cost for hyperparameter, since they have no information for target latency. The author's method directly includes the target latency, resulting in ease of search process.","The existing hardware-aware differentiable NAS methods mostly define some hyperparameters to balance between accuracy and latency, including SinglePath NAS, whose loss function is defined as Eq. (6). Since there is no information on the target latency in the loss function, in case there is a strict latency constraint, they have to pay additional search costs for the hyperparameters to let the final architecture have no larger latency than the constraint. In addition, this process needs to be repeated whenever the target latency is changed. In this work, we propose a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology extending the Single-Path NAS technique (Stamoulis et al., 2019). We modify the supernet architecture by varying the number of blocks in stages and adding mixed depthwise convolution (Tan and Le, 2019b) to the search space. By modifying the loss function to directly include the target latency estimated by a cycle-accurate simulator of the target NPU, we could find a better baseline architecture with a shorter latency than the latency constraint. Using a tight latency constraint, we can reduce the search space to find the baseline network fast.

It dominates the existing network models on the target NPU.

"Why authors choose to extend Single-Path NAS as the search strategy, instead of famous NAS methods such as MNASNet?","The authors choose to extend Single-Path NAS as the search strategy instead of famous NAS methods like MNASNet because Single-Path NAS is more efficient in terms of search time and memory requirements, making it more suitable for NPU-aware NAS techniques",The author's aim is building a fast NAS methodology. Single-Path NAS could search a good architecture faster than existing NAS techniques. It builds a faster NAS technique by reducing the number of trainable parameters. Another reason is that Single-Path NAS can be efficiently extended to support MixConv.,"Among diverse techniques to decrease the search cost, Single-Path NAS (Stamoulis et al., 2019) was recently proposed to find a good architecture faster than the existing differentiable NAS techniques. This technique is extended to broaden the search space by including the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block in the search space (Stamoulis et al., 2020). Our work is grounded on the original Single-Path NAS technique. Differentiable NAS methods usually define architecture parameters to choose which convolution layer to use in the block, training each convolution layer independently. Single-Path NAS (Stamoulis et al., 2019) reduce the search cost by decreasing the number of trainable parameters by sharing the kernel weights between convolution layers.The key idea is designing an over-parameterized depthwise convolution kernel named superkernel, and letting each depthwise convolution kernel of candidate MBConvs directly inherit the weights of this superkernel. We finish this subsection by highlighting the merit of Single-Path NAS on building a MixConv-based differentiable NAS. Conventional multi-path NAS methods would have difficulties when adding inverted bottleneck convolution with MixConv to their search space. Since the number of possible choices of such blocks grows proportionally to the partition number, multi-path NAS methods would introduce a significant increase in memory requirements and the search time. On the contrary, MixConv can be efficiently supported in Single-Path NAS, as explained below. Since an NPU is much faster than a GPU, it enables us to explore the wider search space for NAS under a given latency constraint. Since there are many factors to define the search space, such as the number of layers, channels, kernel sizes, and so on, the search space grows exponentially as the allowed computation complexity grows. Hence, reducing the search space, as well as the search time, is very challenging for NPU-aware NAS techniques. While the aforementioned work for Google’s Edge TPU trains each architecture candidate from scratch to estimate the performance, it is not computationally efficient. In contrast, we adopt a fast differentiable hardware-aware One-Shot NAS, called Single-Path NAS (Stamoulis et al., 2019), in order to reduce the search time. In this work, we propose a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology extending the Single-Path NAS technique (Stamoulis et al., 2019). We modify the supernet architecture by varying the number of blocks in stages and adding mixed depthwise convolution (Tan and Le, 2019b) to the search space.

How does equation 2 let the supernet search kernel size?,"Equation 2 lets the supernet search kernel size by comparing the norm of the kernel weights with a threshold value t, and only keeping the weights with a norm above the threshold","They define a trainable threshold value t, and compare the norm of the kernel weights with the threshold, to determine the kernel size.","Let \mathbf{w}_{k,e} denote the depthwise convolution kernel of candidate MBConv with kernel size k and expansion ratio e (MBConv{}_{k,e}). First, they introduce a large \mathbf{w}_{5,6}, which is the DWConv kernel of MBConv{}_{5,6}. Then, the inner core of \mathbf{w}_{5,6} can be considered as \mathbf{w}_{3,6}, a DWConv kernel of MBConv{}_{3,6}.A superkernel containing these two kernel size options can be expressed as Figure 4:(1)\mathbf{w}_{*,6}=\mathbf{w}_{3,6}+\mathbbm{1}(\rm{use\leavevmode\nobreak\ kernel\leavevmode\nobreak\ size\leavevmode\nobreak\ 5})\cdot\mathbf{w}_{5\backslash 3,6}where \mathbf{w}_{5\backslash 3,e} means the outer part, \mathbf{w}_{5,e}-\mathbf{w}_{3,e}.Next, they formulate conditions to determine the kernel size. They define a certain threshold value t and compare the norm of the kernel weights with the threshold. If the norm of a subset weight is larger than the threshold, it remains in the supernet. To this end, Eq. (1) is changed as follows:(2)\mathbf{w}_{*,6}(t_{k=5})=\mathbf{w}_{3,6}+\mathbbm{1}(\lVert\mathbf{w}_{5\backslash 3,6}\rVert^{2}>t_{k=5})\cdot\mathbf{w}_{5\backslash 3,6} The threshold value is also trainable to be automatically chosen during training. To enable back-propagation, they relax 1(x > t) to σ(x − t) when computing gradients. In addition, they optimize kernel weights and threshold values simultaneously. For a given tight search time, this method is shown to be more effective than the other methods [29]."
What is 'cumulative depth up to a specific stage' ?,The cumulative depth up to a specific stage is the total number of blocks starting from the very first block in the network up to the last block in that specific stage,The total number of blocks starting from the very first bloci in the network up to the last block in a specific stage.,"In this section, we will briefly review the Single-Path NAS technique and our target NPU.Before going further, we define some terminologies used in this paper, as shown in Figure 3. A neural architecture consists of stages at the top level. A stage consists of a sequence of blocks whose output feature maps have the same dimension. In the proposed supernet, a block is defined as MBConv that typically starts with 1×1 conv (expansion layer) and ends with 1×1 conv. Adopting the MixConv approach, the depthwise convolution layer consists of parallel superkernels whose kernel size will be determined during the NAS process. The width of block denotes the number of channels in the final output feature map of the block, and the width of stage is the width of the final block in the stage. We will call the total number of blocks starting from the very first block in the network up to the last block in a specific stage S, as the cumulative depth up to stage S."
How does the authors verify adding h-swish and SE is beneficial?,"By comparing four combinations of using h-swish and SE activation functions, the authors verify that adding both SE and h-swish activation functions improves accuracy by around 1%","Previous works showed that using swish activation function instead of ReLU showed better accuracy, and h-swish shows similar impact on accuracy. The authors verify that replacing ReLU with h-swish and adding SE improves the accuracy by around 1%.","Extensive studies have been conducted to find a better activation function than ReLU, and the swish activation function (Ramachandranet al., 2017) was found. Several neural networks (Tan and Le, 2019b; Mei et al., 2019; Tan and Le, 2019a) use swish activation function instead of ReLU to improve accuracy. Howard et al. (Howard et al., 2019) proposed a quantization-friendly version of the swish activation function called h-swish that has a similar impact on accuracy. So, we replace ReLU with h-swish (Howard et al., 2019) activation function. We improve the baseline network by adding the h-swish activation function and squeeze-and-excitation(SE) block to get the ours-M+ model. Figure 12 shows the topology of ours-M+ architecture in which the height of each block is proportional to the expansion ratio of the block. Compared with the baseline network, ours-M, we achieve around 1% accuracy boost with ours-M+, paying the cost of 16% latency increase. This model outperforms the other models, 0.5% higher accuracy and 14% faster than EfficientNet-B2. Since EfficientNet-B2 is too large to run with the default configuration on MIDAP, we increase the memory size for filter weights.  To examine how SE and h-swish impact accuracy individually, we compare four combinations as displayed in Table 8. The baseline is ours-M that does not use SE and h-swish activation function. Replacing ReLU with h-swish gives a marginal improvement on accuracy while adding SE blocks improves the accuracy noticeably. Adding both SE and h-swish activation function improves the accuracy by around 1%. For accurate latency estimation, an analytical latency estimator is devised, based on a cycle-level NPU simulator that runs an entire CNN considering the memory access overhead accurately.Since the NPU assumed in this paper can execute depth-wise separable convolution (DWConv), squeeze-and-excitation (SE), and h-swish activation function efficiently, the proposed supernet prefers DWConv to regular convolution. Observing that the accuracy is improved by around 1% if SE and h-swish activation function are used, we add a post-processing phase after a CNN network is found by NAS to add SE layers and to replace ReLU to h-swish activation function."
What happens if author removes the linear supernet design and opt to use the covnentional supernet design?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The accuracy would likely decrease","Using the conventional, constant depth method would drop the accuracy.","As shown in Table 4, a supernet with linear depth outperforms a supernet with constant depth in terms of accuracy with similar latency. It confirms that this simple change of block assignment in supernet gives notable accuracy boost with the same latency constraint, without any additional optimization techniques. The number of blocks is one of the key parameters in this structure. Some recent studies [23, 24] report that the way of assigning the number of blocks in each stage has a noticeable impact on the accuracy, even with the same number of blocks in total. However, in conventional One-Shot NAS methods, each stage in the supernet has the same number of blocks [8, 17, 18, 22]."
How can rely on this latency prediction model?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

With high confidence, as the proposed latency prediction model has a MAPE of only 0.16%, indicating a high degree of accuracy",The latency of randomly generated models shows that the latency model is accurate.,"Figure 9 shows the estimated latency and simulated latency of randomly generated 100 models on our search space. It validates the accuracy of the proposed latency model, whose mean absolute percentage error(MAPE) is about 0.16%."
What is the difference between Siamese Network and our works?,"Siamese Networks use a non-trainable edge feature, while our works use a trainable distance metric (cosine or Euclidean) and a contextual mechanism (attention LSTM or prototype representation) to improve one-shot learning",Learned distance from Siamese network can be used to solve one-shot problems. This network can play a role as a single layer message-passing iteration of our model.,"Siamese Networks Koch et al. (2015) can be interpreted asa single layer message-passing iteration of our model, and using the same initialnode embedding (5) {\bf x}_{i}^{(0)}=(\phi(x_{i}),h_{i}) , using a non-trainableedge feature\varphi({\bf x}_{i},{\bf x}_{j})=\|\phi(x_{i})-\phi(x_{j})\|~{},~{}\tilde{A}^{(0)}=\text{softmax}(-\varphi)~{},and resulting label estimation\hat{Y}_{*}=\sum_{j}\tilde{A}_{*,j}^{(0)}\langle{\bf x}_{j}^{(0)},u\rangle~{},with u selecting the label field from {\bf x}. In this model,the learning is reduced to learning image embeddings \phi(x_{i}) whoseeuclidean metric is consistent with the label similarities. Since then, great progress has been done in one-shot learning. Koch et al. (2015) presented a deep-learning model based on computing the pair-wise distance between samples using Siamese Networks, then, this learned distance can be used to solve one-shot problems by k-nearest neighbors classification. Vinyals et al. (2016) Presented an end-to-end trainable k-nearest neighbors using the cosine distance, they also introduced a contextual mechanism using an attention LSTM model that takes into account all the samples of the subset \mathcal{T} when computing the pair-wise distance between samples. Snell et al. (2017) extended the work from Vinyals et al. (2016), by using euclidean distance instead of cosine which provided significant improvements, they also build a prototype representation of each class for the few-shot learning scenario. Mehrotra & Dukkipati (2017) trained a deep residual network together with a generative model to approximate the pair-wise distance between samples."
What does Active learning means?,Active learning refers to a machine learning paradigm in which the learner has the option to request those missing labels that will be most helpful for the prediction task,Active learning is training strategy which uses both labeld and unlabeld data in training as well as semi-supervised learning.,"Besides few-shot learning, a related task is the ability to learn from a mixture oflabeled and unlabeled examples — semi-supervised learning, as wellas active learning, in which the learner has the option to request those missing labelsthat will be most helpful for the prediction task.Our graph-based architecture is naturally extended to these setups withminimal changes in the training design.We validate experimentally the model on few-shot image classification, matchingstate-of-the-art performance with considerably fewer parameters,and demonstrate applications to semi-supervised and active learning setups."
"If there are few examples for learn, we called them few-shot learning. Guess the meaning of zero-shot learning.","Sure! Here's my answer:

Zero-shot learning refers to the ability of a machine learning model to make predictions on unseen examples or classes, without requiring any training data from those classes","Few-shot learning is learning from few examples. Therefore, zero-shot learning is learning from no real example.","One such instance is the ability to learn from few examples, in the so-called few-shot learning tasks.Rather than relying on regularization to compensate for the lack of data, researchers have exploredways to leverage a distribution of similar tasks, inspired by human learning Lake et al. (2015).This defines a new supervised learning setup (also called ‘meta-learning’) in which the input-outputpairs are no longer given by iid samples of images and their associated labels, but by iid samples ofcollections of images and their associated label similarity."
What is the demerit of using GNN?,Computational cost,Demerit of GNN is high computational complexity.

Explain the meaning of N-Way and M-shot. ,"Sure! Here's my answer:

N-Way and M-shot refer to the number of classes and the number of training examples used in few-shot learning experiments, respectively. In our experiments, we vary N (the number of classes) and M (the number of training examples) to evaluate the performance of our model on different few-shot tasks","N-way and M-shot means that we sample N random classes from the dataset, and we sample M random samples from each class.","We evaluate our model by performing different q-shot, K-way experiments on both datasets. For every few-shot task \mathcal{T}, we sample K random classes from the dataset, and from each class we sample q random samples. An extra sample to classify is chosen from one of that K classes."
Few-shot learning and semi-supervised learning is the same term. Is this true?,"No. While both few-shot learning and semi-supervised learning involve learning from limited labeled data, they are distinct concepts.

Matching network uses BERT. Is this true?,No,"It's not true. Matching network uses attention mechanism, not BERT.","Matching networks Vinyals et al. (2016) use a set representation for the ensemble of images in \mathcal{T},similarly as our proposed graph neural network model, but with two important differences.First, the attention mechanism considered in this set representationis akin to the edge feature learning, with the difference that the mechanism attends always to the same node embeddings, as opposed to our stacked adjacency learning, which is closer to Vaswani et al. (2017). In other words, instead of the attention kernel in (3),matching networks consider attention mechanisms of the form \tilde{A}_{*,j}^{(k)}=\varphi({\bf x}_{*}^{(k)},{\bf x}_{j}^{(T)}),where {\bf x}_{j}^{(T)} is the encoding function for the elements of the support set, obtained with bidirectional LSTMs. In that case, the support set encoding is thus computed independently of the target image.Second, the label and image fields are treated separately throughout the model, with a final step that aggregates linearly the labels using a trained kernel. This may prevent the model to leverage complex dependencies between labels and images at intermediate stages."
"Give two examples which fit in following case: “Despite these successes, this learning setup does not cover many aspects where learning is nonetheless possible and desirable.”","Sure! Here are two examples that fit the case:

1. Adversarial training: Despite the success of supervised end-to-end learning in computer vision, there is still a need for training models to be robust against adversarial attacks, which cannot be fully addressed by supervised learning.
2. Multi-modal learning: Supervised end-to-end learning primarily focuses on single-modal input data, but there are many applications where multiple modalities need to be combined, such as in natural language processing or multimodal sentiment analysis, which cannot be fully covered by supervised end-to-end learning","There were great succeed in computer vision and speech tasks. However, this learning setup does not cover many aspects where learning is nonetheless possible and desirable.","Supervised end-to-end learning has been extremely successful in computer vision, speech, or machine translation tasks,thanks to improvements in optimization technology, larger datasets and streamlined designs of deep convolutional or recurrent architectures.

What does Omniglot means?,Omniglot is a dataset of characters from 50 different alphabets,"Omniglot is a dataset consist of 1623 characters from 50 different alphabets. In this dataset, 20 different people drew each character.","Omniglot is a dataset of 1623 characters from 50 different alphabets, each character/class has been drawn by 20 different people. Following Vinyals et al. (2016) implementation we split the dataset into 1200 classes for training and the remaining 423 for testing. We augmented the dataset by multiples of 90 degrees as proposed by Santoro et al. (2016)."
What significance do the numbers like 51.3 and 30.0 have with respect to the One Billion Word benchmark? ,"Sure! Here's my answer:

These numbers represent the perplexity of the language model on the holdout data set, which is a common measure of progress in language modeling. In this case, a lower perplexity value indicates a better fit of the model to the data, and a value of 51.3 or 30.0 would indicate that the model is performing well on the given task","As the average per-word log-probability, perplexity is a measure of how confused the language model is in predicting the next word.","The typical measure used for reporting progress in language modeling is perplexity, which is the average per-word log-probability on the holdout data set: e^{-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}\ln{p_{w_{i}}}}. We follow the standard procedure and sum over all the words (including the end of sentence symbol)."
"What exactly is ""smoothing"" and how does it help count-based LMs account for unseen sequences?",Smoothing helps count-based language models account for unseen sequences by estimating the probability of rare or out-of-vocabulary sequences,The paper does not discuss what smoothing is or how it helps some LMs account for unseen sequences.,"Language Modeling (LM) has been a central task in NLP. The goal of LM is to learn a probability distribution over sequences of symbols pertaining to a language. Much work has been done on both parametric (e.g., log-linear models) and non-parametric approaches (e.g., count-based LMs). Count-based approaches (based on statistics of N-grams) typically add smoothing which account for unseen (yet possible) sequences, and have been quite successful. To this extent, Kneser-Ney smoothed 5-gram models (Kneser & Ney, 1995) are a fairly strong baseline which, for large amounts of training data, have challenged other parametric approaches based on Neural Networks (Bengio et al., 2006)."
"What is a ""recurrent state space""?","A recurrent state space refers to the set of internal states that an RNN or LSTM model uses to capture information from previous time steps, allowing it to process sequences of data",Paper does not discuss what a recurrent state space is.,"A crucial aspect which we discuss in detail in later sections is the size of our models. Despite the large number of parameters, we try to minimize computation as much as possible by adopting a strategy proposed in (Sak et al., 2014) of projecting a relatively big recurrent state space down so that the matrices involved remain relatively small, yet the model has large memory capacity. Unsurprisingly, size matters: when training on a very large and complex data set, fitting the training data with an LSTM is fairly challenging. Thus, the size of the LSTM layer is a very important factor that influences the results, as seen in Table 1. The best models are the largest we were able to fit into a GPU memory. Our largest model was a 2-layer LSTM with 8192+1024 dimensional recurrent state in each of the layers. Increasing the embedding and projection size also helps but causes a large increase in the number of parameters, which is less desirable. Lastly, training an RNN instead of an LSTM yields poorer results (about 5 perplexity worse) for a comparable model size."
What is the difference between a 1-d CNN and a 2-layer highway network?,"A 1-d CNN is a convolutional neural network that operates on one-dimensional data, such as text, while a 2-layer highway network is a type of recurrent neural network that allows the embedding to learn semantic representations",The paper does not discuss the difference between 1D CNN and highway networks.,"In (Kim et al., 2015), the words characters are processed by a 1-d CNN (Le Cun et al., 1990) with max-pooling across the sequence for each convolutional feature. The resulting features are fed to a 2-layer highway network (Srivastava et al., 2015b), which allows the embedding to learn semantic representations. The model was evaluated on small-scale language modeling experiments for various languages and matched the best results on the PTB data set despite having 60% fewer parameters."
What is a 128-dim correction?,a 128-dimensional bottleneck embedding,It is a means of improvement over words that have different meaning but are spelled similarly.,"z_{w}=h^{T}CNN(chars_{w})+h^{T}Mcorr_{w}where M is a matrix projecting a low-dimensional embedding vector corr_{w} back up to the dimensionality of the projected LSTM hidden state of h. This amounts to adding a bottleneck linear layer, and brings the CNN Softmax much closer to our best result, as can be seen in Table 1, where adding a 128-dim correction halves the gap between regular and the CNN Softmax. As described in Section 3.2, adding a “correction” word embedding term alleviates the gap between regular and CNN Softmax. Indeed, we can trade-off model size versus perplexity. For instance, by adding 100M weights (through a 128 dimensional bottleneck embedding) we achieve 35.8 perplexity (see Table 1)."
What is dropout and how does it alleviate overfitting?,"Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the activations of a neural network to zero during training, helping to alleviate overfitting by preventing the model from relying too heavily on any single feature",Dropout is a neural network component parametrized with a probability. The paper does not discuss how it alleviates overfitting.,"Following (Zaremba et al., 2014) we use dropout (Srivastava, 2013) before and after every LSTM layer. The biases of LSTM forget gate were initialized to 1.0 (Jozefowicz et al., 2015). The size of the models will be described in more detail in the following sections, and the choices of hyper-parameters will be released as open source upon publication. As shown in Table 1, using dropout improves the results. To our surprise, even relatively small models (e.g., single layer LSTM with 2048 units projected to 512 dimensional outputs) can over-fit the training set if trained long enough, eventually yielding holdout set degradation. Using dropout on non-recurrent connections largely mitigates these issues. While over-fitting still occurs, there is no more need for early stopping. For models that had 4096 or less units in the LSTM layer, we used 10% dropout probability. For larger models, 25% was significantly better. Even with such regularization, perplexities on the training set can be as much as 6 points below test."
How does IS and NCE compare in terms of model performance? ,IS outperforms NCE in terms of model performance,IS performs better.,"p(Y=k|W)\propto_{Y}\frac{p_{d}(w_{k})}{p_{n}(w_{k})}and, following a similar argument than for NCE, if we define p(Y=k|W)=softmax(s_{\theta}(w_{k})-\log p_{n}(w_{k})) then p^{\prime}(w)=softmax(s_{\theta}(w,h)) is a good approximation of p_{d}(word). Note that the only difference between NCE and IS is that, in NCE, we define a binary classification task between true or noise words with a logistic loss, whereas in IS we define a multiclass classification problem with a Softmax and cross entropy loss. We hope that our derivation helps clarify the similarities and differences between the two. In particular, we observe that IS, as it optimizes a multiclass classification task (in contrast to solving a binary task), may be a better choice. Indeed, the updates to the logits with IS are tied whereas in NCE they are independent. Table 3 shows the test perplexities of NCE vs IS loss after a few epochs of 2048 unit LSTM with 512 projection. The IS objective significantly improves the speed and the overall performance of the model when compared to NCE."
Why doesn't character-level embeddings degrade performance compared to word-level embeddings? ,Character-level embeddings do not degrade performance compared to word-level embeddings because the CNN architecture used to generate the Softmax word embeddings is able to capture the contextual information of the words without sharing parameters with the input word-embedding sub-network,The paper discusses one advantage of character-level embeddings over word-level embeddings. There is no comprehensive discussion on why the resulting performance does not degrade.,"The character-level features allow for a smoother and compact parametrization of the word embeddings. Recent efforts on small scale language modeling have used CNN character embeddings for the input embeddings (Kim et al., 2015). Although not as straightforward, we propose an extension to this idea to also reduce the number of parameters of the Softmax layer. Recall from Section 2.3 that the Softmax computes a logit as z_{w}=h^{T}e_{w} where h is a context vector and e_{w} the word embedding. Instead of building a matrix of |V|\times|h| (whose rows correspond to e_{w}), we produce e_{w} with a CNN over the characters of w as e_{w}=CNN(chars_{w}) – we call this a CNN Softmax. We used the same network architecture to dynamically generate the Softmax word embeddings without sharing the parameters with the input word-embedding sub-network. For inference, the vectors e_{w} can be precomputed, so there is no computational complexity increase w.r.t. the regular Softmax."
How does maximizing log-likelihood lead to optimizing cross-entropy between target probability distribution and the model prediction?,"Maximizing log-likelihood leads to optimizing cross-entropy between the target probability distribution and the model prediction because the log-likelihood is a measure of how well the model's predictions match the target distribution. The cross-entropy loss function is a common measure of the difference between two probability distributions, and maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the cross-entropy loss. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss, the model is able to learn a probability distribution that is close to the target distribution, which in turn allows it to make more accurate predictions",The paper does not discuss the detailed workings of the established relation.,"Assigning probability distributions over large vocabularies is computationally challenging. For modeling language, maximizing log-likelihood of a given word sequence leads to optimizing cross-entropy between the target probability distribution (e.g., the target word we should be predicting), and our model predictions p. Generally, predictions come from a linear layer followed by a Softmax non-linearity: p(w)=\frac{\exp(z_{w})}{\sum_{w^{\prime}\in V}\exp(z_{w^{\prime}})} where z_{w} is the logit corresponding to a word w. The logit is generally computed as an inner product z_{w}=h^{T}e_{w} where h is a context vector and e_{w} is a “word embedding” for w."
How does increasing the embedding and projection size help with respect to the model? ,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Increasing the embedding and projection size helps to improve the model's performance by providing more information to the model about the input data. This allows the model to learn more nuanced and complex patterns in the data, leading to better performance. However, increasing the embedding and projection size also increases the number of parameters in the model, which can be less desirable",The paper does not discuss how the positive effects are brought about.,"Unsurprisingly, size matters: when training on a very large and complex data set, fitting the training data with an LSTM is fairly challenging. Thus, the size of the LSTM layer is a very important factor that influences the results, as seen in Table 1. The best models are the largest we were able to fit into a GPU memory.

Previous RE task SOTA model was provided by Yamada et. al. at 2020. Is this true?,"True. According to the text, the SOTA F_{1} result for the RE task was achieved by LUKE (Yamada et al., 2020) with a score of 72.7\%, indicating that the previous SOTA model was provided by Yamada et al. in 2020",It is true. LUKE Yamada et al. (2020) is one of SOTA model in RE task. This model extends the pretraining objective of masked language modeling to entities and proposes an entity-aware self-attention mechanism.,"Recent work on sentence-level RE can be divided into two lines.One focuses on injecting external knowledge into PLMs.Methods of such, including ERNIE Zhang et al.

Give one example Relation Extraction question and its answer.,"Sure! Here's an example Relation Extraction question and its answer:

Question: What is the relationship between ""Elon Musk"" and ""Tesla""?

ORG:FOUNDED_BY","Relation Extraction(RE) task is task of finding relationship between two entities. For instance, with given text “Bill Gates founded Microsoft together with his friend Paul Allen in 1975” and an entity pair (“Bill Gates”, “Microsoft”), the RE model should find the relation ORG:FOUNDED_BY","As one of the fundamental information extraction (IE) tasks,relation extraction (RE) aims at identifying the relationship(s) between two entities in a given piece of text from a pre-defined set of relationships of interest.For example, given the sentence “Bill Gates founded Microsoft together with his friend Paul Allen in 1975” and an entity pair (“Bill Gates”, “Microsoft”), the RE model is expected to predict the relation ORG:FOUNDED_BY.On this task, SOTA models based on PLMs Devlin et al. (2019); Joshi et al. (2020) have gained significant success."
What are the obstacles of RE? Does this paper solved them?,The obstacles of RE are (1) limited representation of entity information in the text and (2) noisy or ill-defined labels in human-labeled datasets. This paper proposes an improved RE baseline that addresses these obstacles by introducing a typed entity marker and improving the annotation strategy,"There are two obstacles of RE. First, existing method has limit of characterization of the entities. Second, there are many noises in human labeled data. They improve the model performance by addressing these problems.","In this work, we discuss two obstacles that have hindered the performance of existing RE models.First, the RE task provides a structured input of both the raw texts and side information of the entities, such as entity names, spans, and types (typically provided by NER models), which are shown important to the performance of RE models Peng et al. (2020).However, existing methods fall short of representing the entity information comprehensively in the text, leading to limited characterization of the entities.Second, human-labeled RE datasets (e.g., TACRED), may contain a large portion of noisy or ill-defined labels, causing the model performance to be misestimated.Alt et al. (2020) relabeled the development and test set of TACRED and found that 6.62\% of labels are incorrect.Stoica et al. (2021) refined many ill-defined relation types and further re-annotated the TACRED dataset using an improved annotation strategy to ensure high-quality labels.To this end, we propose an improved RE baseline, where we introduce the typed entity marker to sentence-level RE, which leads to promising improvement of performance over existing RE models."
Is there any different way to construct RE model instead of using PLM strategy previously?,"Yes.

Instead of relying solely on pre-trained language models (PLMs), there are alternative approaches to constructing RE models that have shown promise. One such approach is to use knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) to represent entities and relations, as proposed in the paper ""Knowledge-Enhanced Neural Machine Translation with Multi-Source Training"" by Zhang et al. (2019). This approach has been shown to improve the performance of RE models on certain benchmarks. Additionally, other research has explored the use of multimodal features, such as images and text, to improve the accuracy of RE models","Yes, there are several works of constructing RE model. ERNIE Zhang et al. (2019) and KnowBERT Peters et al. (2019) construct RE model by injecting external knowledge into PLMs. BERT-MTB Baldini Soares et al. (2019) continually pretrain PLMs on text with linked entities using relation-oriented objectives.","Recent work on sentence-level RE can be divided into two lines.One focuses on injecting external knowledge into PLMs.Methods of such, including ERNIE Zhang et al. (2019) and KnowBERT Peters et al. (2019), take entity embedding pretrained from knowledge graphs as inputs to the Transformer.Similarly, K-Adapter Wang et al. (2020) introduces a plug-in neural adaptor that injects factual and linguistic knowledge into the language model.LUKE Yamada et al.

What datasets did this paper used for?,"TACRED, TACREV, and Re-TACRED","They used three datasets, the original TACRED Zhang et al. (2017), TACREV Alt et al. (2020), and Re-TACRED Stoica et al. (2021).","Datasets. The datasets we have used in the experiments include three versions of TACRED: the original TACRED Zhang et al. (2017), TACREV Alt et al. (2020), and Re-TACRED Stoica et al.

(2021) further refined the label definitions in TACRED and relabeled the whole dataset.We provide the statistics of the datasets in Appendix A. In this paper, we present a simple yet strong RE baseline that offers new SOTA performance, along with a comprehensive study to understand its prediction generalizability and robustness.Specifically, we revisit two technical problems in sentence-level RE, namely entity representation and noisy or ill-defined labels.We propose an improved entity representation technique, which significantly outperforms existing sentence-level RE models.Especially, our improved RE baseline achieves an F_{1} score of 91.1\% on the Re-TACRED dataset, showing that PLMs already achieve satisfactory performance on this task.We hope the proposed techniques and analyses can benefit future research on RE."
Can improvement of NER technology improves RE technology?,Yes,"Entity names, spans and types are important to the performance of RE models Peng et al. (2020). Since types are typically provided by NER models, improvement of NER technology can improve RE technology.","In this work, we discuss two obstacles that have hindered the performance of existing RE models.First, the RE task provides a structured input of both the raw texts and side information of the entities, such as entity names, spans, and types (typically provided by NER models), which are shown important to the performance of RE models Peng et al.

Should RE model use spanBERT instead of BERT?,"Yes.

SpanBERT has been shown to achieve improved performance on RE tasks compared to BERT, due to its specific training objective of span prediction and its ability to attend to entity embeddings pretrained on knowledge bases","SpanBERT Joshi et al. (2020) achieved improved performance on RE than BERT. Therefore, RE model should use spanBERT to improve model performance.","Compared methods.We compare with the following methods.PA-LSTM Zhang et al. (2017) adopts bi-directional LSTM Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) and positional-aware attention Bahdanau et al. (2015) to encode the text into an embedding, which is then fed into a softmax layer to predict the relation.C-GCN Zhang et al. (2018) is a graph-based model, which feeds the pruned dependency tree of the sentence into the graph convolutional network Kipf and Welling (2017) to obtain the representation of entities.SpanBERT Joshi et al. (2020) is a PLM based on the Transformer Vaswani et al. (2017). It extends BERT Devlin et al. (2019) by incorporating a training objective of span prediction and achieves improved performance on RE.KnowBERT Peters et al. (2019) jointly trains a language model and an entity linker, which allows the subtokens to attend to entity embedding that is pretrained on knowledge bases.LUKE Yamada et al. (2020) pretrains the language model on both large text corpora and knowledge graphs. It adds frequent entities into the vocabulary and proposes an entity-aware self-attention mechanism."
Author said that they achieved to make SOTA RE models. Give an evidences for this statement.,The authors achieved SOTA RE models by achieving an F1 score of 91.1% on the Re-TACRED dataset with their improved entity representation technique,"Their improved RE baseline achieved SOTA performance on the RE-TACRED dataset with f1 score of 91.1%. Moreover, Using RoBERTa Liu et al. (2019) as the backbone, they improved baseline model on TACRED and TACREV with f1 score 74.6% and 83.2%, respectively. The RoBERTa model achieves 1.9% higher f1 score than the SOTA model LUKE Yamada et al.","We first provide an analysis on different entity representation techniques. In this analysis, we use the base and large versions of BERT Devlin et al. (2019) and the large version of RoBERTa Liu et al. (2019) as the encoder.Table 1 shows the performance of the PLMs incorporated with different entity representation techniques.For each technique, we also provide an example of the processed text.We have several observations from the results.First, the typed entity marker and its variants outperform untyped entity representation techniques by a notable margin.Especially, the RoBERTa model achieves an F_{1} score of 74.6\% using the typed entity marker (punct), which is significantly higher than the SOTA result of 72.7\% by LUKE Yamada et al. (2020).This shows that representing all categories of entity information is helpful to the RE task.It also shows that keeping entity names in the input improves the performance of RE models.Second, symbols used in entity markers have an obvious impact on the performance of RE models.Although the original and punct versions of entity representation techniques represent the same categories of entity information, they do lead to a difference in model performance.Particularly, introducing new special tokens hinders the model performance drastically on RoBERTa.On RoBERTa{}_{\text{LARGE}}, the entity marker underperforms the entity marker (punct) by 0.7\%, the typed entity marker underperforms the typed entity marker (punct) by 3.6\%, while the entity mask gets a much worse result of 60.9\%. In this paper, we present a simple yet strong RE baseline that offers new SOTA performance, along with a comprehensive study to understand its prediction generalizability and robustness.Specifically, we revisit two technical problems in sentence-level RE, namely entity representation and noisy or ill-defined labels.We propose an improved entity representation technique, which significantly outperforms existing sentence-level RE models.Especially, our improved RE baseline achieves an F_{1} score of 91.1\% on the Re-TACRED dataset, showing that PLMs already achieve satisfactory performance on this task.We hope the proposed techniques and analyses can benefit future research on RE. We evaluate our model on TACRED Zhang et al. (2017), TACREV Alt et al. (2020), and Re-TACRED Stoica et al. (2021).Using RoBERTa Liu et al. (2019) as the backbone, our improved baseline model achieves an F_{1} of 74.6\% and 83.2\% on TACRED and TACREV, respectively, significantly outperforming various SOTA RE models.Particularly, our baseline model achieves an F_{1} of 91.1\% on Re-TACRED, demonstrating that PLMs can achieve much better results on RE than shown in previous work.222This work first appeared as a technical report on arXiv in Feb 2021 Zhou and Chen (2021).Since then, the proposed techniques have been incorporated into several follow-up works Chen et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2022b, a); Lu et al. (2022); Han et al. (2021); Kulkarni et al. (2022) that are published before this version of the paper."
Entity marker and entity mask are same terms. Is this true?,"NO.

Entity marker and entity mask are not the same terms, although they are related techniques used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for entity recognition and masking. Entity marker is a technique that introduces special tokens to enclose entity spans in the input text, while entity mask is a technique that replaces specific entity names with special tokens to prevent overfitting in the Recall-based Entity Recognition (RE) model","It's not true. Two term has different meaning. Entity marker is the teqnique introduces special tokens pairs to enclose the object and subject entities, whereas entity mask is the teqnique introduces new special tokens to mask the object or object entities.","•Entity mask Zhang et al. (2017). This technique introduces new special tokens [SUBJ-TYPE] or [OBJ-TYPE] to mask the subject or object entities in the original text, where TYPE is substituted with the respective entity type.This technique was originally proposed in the PA-LSTM model Zhang et al. (2017), and was later adopted by PLMs such as SpanBERT Joshi et al. (2020).Zhang et al. (2017) claim that this technique prevents the RE model from over-fitting specific entity names, leading to more generalizable inference.•Entity marker Zhang et al. (2019); Baldini Soares et al. (2019). This technique introduces special tokens pairs [E1], [/E1] and [E2], [/E2] to enclose the subject and object entities, therefore modifying the input text to the format of “[E1] subj [/E1] … [E2] obj [/E2]”333subj and obj are respectively the original token spans of subject and object entities..•Entity marker (punct) Wang et al. (2020); Zhou et al. (2021). This technique is a variant of the previous technique that encloses entity spans using punctuation.It modifies the input text to “@ subj @ … # obj #”. The main difference from the previous technique is that this one does not introduce new special tokens into the model’s reserved vocabulary.•Typed entity marker Zhong and Chen (2021). This technique further incorporates the NER types into entity markers.It introduces new special tokens \langleS:TYPE\rangle, \langle/S:TYPE\rangle, \langleO:TYPE\rangle, \langle/O:TYPE\rangle, where TYPE is the corresponding NER type given by a named entity tagger. The input text is accordingly modified to “\langleS:TYPE\rangle subj \langle/S:TYPE\rangle … \langleO:TYPE\rangle obj \langle/O:TYPE\rangle”.•Typed entity marker (punct). We propose a variant of the typed entity marker technique that marks the entity span and entity types without introducing new special tokens.This is to enclose the subject and object entities with “@” and “#”, respectively.We also represent the subject and object entity types using their label text, which is prepended to the entity spans and is enclosed by “*” for subjects or “\wedge” for objects.The modified text is “@ * subj-type * subj @ … # \wedge obj-type \wedge obj # ”, where subj-type and obj-type is the label text of NER types."
BLINK is Scalable. Is this true?,Yes,"The paper shows the scalability of the proposed simple two-stage method with the experiments conducted on the zero-shot entity-linking dataset where external entity knowledge is not available, which enables the model to be used on various entity linking tasks that contain millions of possible entities to consider. The state-of-the-art result and the extensive evaluation of the accuracy-speed trade-off support that the proposed method is efficient and scalable.","Scale is a key challenge for entity linking; there are millions of possible entities to consider for each mention. To efficiently filter or rank the candidates, existing methods use different sources of external information, including manually curated mention tables Ganea and Hofmann (2017), incoming Wikipedia link popularity Yamada et al. (2016), and gold Wikipedia entity categories Gillick et al. (2019). In this paper, we show that BERT-based models set new state-of-the-art performance levels for large scale entity linking when used in a zero shot setup, where there is no external knowledge and a short text description provides the only information we have for each entity. We also present an extensive evaluation of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent to large pre-trained models, and show is possible to achieve very efficient linking with modest loss of accuracy. More specifically, we introduce a two stage approach for zero-shot linking (see Figure 1 for an overview), based on fine-tuned BERT architectures Devlin et al. (2019). In the first stage, we do retrieval in a dense space defined by a bi-encoder that independently embeds the mention context and the entity descriptions Humeau et al. (2019); Gillick et al. (2019).Each retrieved candidate is then examined more carefully with a cross-encoder that concatenates the mention and entity text, following Logeswaran et al. (2019). This overall approach is conceptually simple but highly effective, as we show through detailed experiments. We proposed a conceptually simple, scalable, and highly effective two stage approach for entity linking. We show that our BERT-based model outperforms IR methods for entity retrieval, and achieved new state-of-the-art results on recently introduced zero-shot entity linking dataset, WikilinksNED Unseen-Mentions dataset, and the more established TACKBP-2010 benchmark, without any task-specific heuristics or external entity knowledge. We present evaluations of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent to large pre-trained models, and show that it is possible to achieve efficient linking with modest loss of accuracy.Finally, we show that knowledge distillation can further improve bi-encoder model performance.Future work includes:•Enriching entity representations by adding entity type and entity graph information;•Modeling coherence by jointly resolving mentions in a document;•Extending our work to other languages and other domains;•Joint models for mention detection and entity linking."
"BLINK have two different versions, bi-encoding version and cross-encoding version. Is this true?",Yes,"BLINK model is a two-stage method using two encoders: bi-encoder and cross-encoder. With the qualitative analysis, the authors compared the BLINK with its bi-encoding version which uses a bi-encoder for candidate ranking instead of a cross-encoder, and showed that the cross-encoding version utilizing context information better than the bi-encoding version. Therefore we can say that BLINK has two different versions.","As expected, the cross-encoder performs better than the bi-encoder on ranking. However, both models exceed state-of-the-art performance levels, demonstrating that the overall approach is highly effective. We observe that our model also performs well when we change the underlying Knowledgebase to full Wikipedia, and even without fine-tuning on the dataset. In Table 5 we show that our bi-encoder model is highly effective at retrieving relevant entities, where the underlying Knowledgebase is full Wikipedia. In the first example, we see that the bi-encoder mistakenly links “Ronaldo” to the Brazilian football player, while the cross-encoder is able to use context word “Juventus” to disambiguate. In the second example, the cross-encoder is able to identify from context that the sentence is describing art instead of fiction, where the bi-encoder failed. In the third example, the bi-encoder is able to find the correct entity “Ancient Greek,”; where the cross-encoder mistakenly links it to the entity “Ancient Greek philosophy,” likely because that the word “philosophers” is in context. We observe that cross-encoder is often better at utilizing context information than bi-encoder, but can sometimes make mistakes because of misleading context cues. Figure 1 shows our overall approach. The bi-encoder uses two independent BERT transformers to encode model context/mention and entity into dense vectors, and each entity candidate is scored as the dot product of these vectors. The candidates retrieved by the bi-encoder are then passed to the cross-encoder for ranking. The cross-encoder encodes context/mention and entity in one transformer, and applies an additional linear layer to compute the final score for each pair. After training our model on Wikipedia, we fine-tune the model on the TACKBP-2010 training dataset. We use the top 100 candidates retrieved by the bi-encoder as training examples for the cross-encoder, and chose hyper-parameters based on cross validation. We report accuracy results in Table 4. For ablation studies, we also report the following versions of our model:"
Using cross-encoder is time-consuming but accurate. Is this true?,Yes,"Since the cross-encoder has large memory consumption and compute footprint, it is time-consuming and not suitable for tasks that require fast inference. However, it is relatively accurate compared to the bi-encoder, which is the reason the author utilized knowledge distillation so that they can obtain some accuracy gain from the cross-encoder. Therefore, we can say that using a cross-encoder is time-consuming but accurate.","Due to its larger memory and compute footprint, we use the cross-encoder in a re-ranking stage, over a small set (≤100)\leq 100)≤ 100 ) of candidates retrieved with the bi-encoder. The cross-encoder is not suitable for retrieval or tasks that require fast inference. Finally, we do an extensive evaluation of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent in our bi- and cross-encoder models.We show that the two stage methods scales well in a full Wikipedia setting, by linking against all the 5.9M Wikipedia entities for TACKBP-2010, while still outperforming existing model with much smaller candidate sets.We also show that bi-encoder linking is very fast with approximate nearest neighbor search (e.g. linking over 5.9 million candidates in 2 milliseconds), and that much of the accuracy gain from the more expensive cross-encoder can be transferred to the bi-encoder via knowledge distillation.We release our code and models, as well as a system to link entity mentions to all of Wikipedia (similar to TagME Ferragina and Scaiella (2011)).111Our code and models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/BLINK"
When does cross-encoder powerful? Give an example.,"When the context provides misleading cues.

In the third example, the cross-encoder is able to correctly identify the entity ""Ancient Greek"" despite the word ""philosophers"" being in the context, which could have misled the bi-encoder into linking the entity to ""Ancient Greek philosophy"" instead","Cross-encoder exerts its power for the cases requiring disambiguation with the given context. Table 8 shows some examples where the cross-encoder can accurately identify and linked entities through the context while the bi-encoder failed.
For example, the cross-encoder links ""Ronaldo"" to a corret person with the context of ""Juventus"", while the bi-encoder links to another football player that are Brazilian. Another example shows that the cross-encoder can identify that the sentence is describing gothic art instead of gothic fiction.","Table 8 presents some examples from our bi-encoder and cross-encoder model predictions, to provide intuition for how these two models consider context and mention for entity linking. In the first example, we see that the bi-encoder mistakenly links “Ronaldo” to the Brazilian football player, while the cross-encoder is able to use context word “Juventus” to disambiguate. In the second example, the cross-encoder is able to identify from context that the sentence is describing art instead of fiction, where the bi-encoder failed.

What TACKBP-2010 means?,TACKBP-2010 is a dataset used for evaluating entity linking systems,"TACKBP-2010 is the dataset for evaluating entity linking systems that are widely used in research in this field like ""Khalife and Vazirgiannis (2018)"" and ""Raiman and Raiman (2018)"". This dataset is made in 2010 and contains the entities in the TAC Reference Knowledge Base which contains 818,741 entities with titles, descriptions, and other meta information. This paper also used the TACKBP-2010 for fine-tuning the model. While it is likely that TACKB and 2010 are from the name of the knowledge base and when the dataset was made, it is not clear what P stands for in TACKBP-2010.","is widely used for evaluating entity linking systems Ji et al. (2010).444https://tac.nist.gov Following prior work, we measure in-KB accuracy (P@1). There are 1,074 and 1,020 annotated mention/entity pairs derived from 1,453 and 2,231 original news and web documents on training and evaluation dataset, respectively. All the entities are from the TAC Reference Knowledgebase which contains 818,741 entities with titles, descriptions and other meta info. After training our model on Wikipedia, we fine-tune the model on the TACKBP-2010 training dataset. We use the top 100 candidates retrieved by the bi-encoder as training examples for the cross-encoder, and chose hyper-parameters based on cross validation. We report accuracy results in Table 4.

There are however many other cues that could potentially be added in future work. For example, Khalife and Vazirgiannis (2018) report 94.57\% precision on the TACKBP-2010 dataset. However, their method is based on the strong assumption that a gold fine-grained entity type is given for each mention (and they do not attempt to do entity type prediction). Indeed, if fine-grained entity type information is given by an oracle at test time, then Raiman and Raiman (2018) reports 98.6\% accuracy on TACKBP-2010, indicating that improving fine-grained entity type prediction would likely improve entity linking. Our results is achieved without gold fine-grained entity type information. Instead, our model learns representations of context, mention and entities based on text only."
Why author emphasized their model as “Zero-shot”?,"The author emphasizes their model as ""zero-shot"" because it does not rely on any external knowledge or pre-training, instead using only a short text description to link entities, achieving state-of-the-art performance levels for large-scale entity linking","In the zero-shot settings, the set of documents/mentions/entities from training data is not visible in test data, which means the information of the entity that should be linked at test time is not learned directly from the training set. This setting is related to scalability, which is important for the entity linking tasks since there can be lots of possible entity candidates for each mention. The proposed BERT-based models can deal with these settings and show their accuracy and efficiency in scale.","Scale is a key challenge for entity linking; there are millions of possible entities to consider for each mention.

(2019) show that dense embeddings work well for candidate generation, but they did not do pre-training and included external category labels in their bi-encoder architectures, limiting their linking to entities in Wikipedia. Our approach can be seen as generalizing both of these lines of work, and showing for the first time that pre-trained zero-shot architectures are both highly accurate and computationally efficient at scale. We also study zero-shot entity linking Logeswaran et al. (2019). Here the document setup is the same, but the knowledge base is separated in training and test time.

How BLINK can achieved zero-shot linking?,"BLINK achieved zero-shot linking by using a two-stage approach with fine-tuned BERT architectures, which first retrieves candidates in a dense space and then examines them more carefully with a cross-encoder. This approach allows BLINK to outperform IR methods for entity retrieval and achieve new state-of-the-art results on large-scale benchmarks without any task-specific heuristics or external entity knowledge",The BLINK model used a two-stage approach for entity linking based on fine-tuned BERT architectures that first encode the mention context and entity text with the bi-encoder for the candidate retrieval and utilize the cross-encoder to score and rank them. These pre-trained architectures are simple yet scalable and effective for entity link tasks without the help of task-specific heuristics or external knowledge. The authors showed that BLINK can achieve state-of-the-art performance for the large-scale entity linking on the dataset with a zero-shot setup. (WikilinksNED Unseen-Mentions and TACKBP-201),"Scale is a key challenge for entity linking; there are millions of possible entities to consider for each mention. To efficiently filter or rank the candidates, existing methods use different sources of external information, including manually curated mention tables Ganea and Hofmann (2017), incoming Wikipedia link popularity Yamada et al. (2016), and gold Wikipedia entity categories Gillick et al. (2019). In this paper, we show that BERT-based models set new state-of-the-art performance levels for large scale entity linking when used in a zero shot setup, where there is no external knowledge and a short text description provides the only information we have for each entity. We also present an extensive evaluation of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent to large pre-trained models, and show is possible to achieve very efficient linking with modest loss of accuracy. More specifically, we introduce a two stage approach for zero-shot linking (see Figure 1 for an overview), based on fine-tuned BERT architectures Devlin et al. (2019). In the first stage, we do retrieval in a dense space defined by a bi-encoder that independently embeds the mention context and the entity descriptions Humeau et al. (2019); Gillick et al. (2019).Each retrieved candidate is then examined more carefully with a cross-encoder that concatenates the mention and entity text, following Logeswaran et al. (2019). This overall approach is conceptually simple but highly effective, as we show through detailed experiments. We proposed a conceptually simple, scalable, and highly effective two stage approach for entity linking. We show that our BERT-based model outperforms IR methods for entity retrieval, and achieved new state-of-the-art results on recently introduced zero-shot entity linking dataset, WikilinksNED Unseen-Mentions dataset, and the more established TACKBP-2010 benchmark, without any task-specific heuristics or external entity knowledge. We present evaluations of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent to large pre-trained models, and show that it is possible to achieve efficient linking with modest loss of accuracy.Finally, we show that knowledge distillation can further improve bi-encoder model performance.Future work includes:•Enriching entity representations by adding entity type and entity graph information;•Modeling coherence by jointly resolving mentions in a document;•Extending our work to other languages and other domains;•Joint models for mention detection and entity linking. Two recent results are most closely related to our work. Logeswaran et al. (2019) proposed the zero-shot entity linking task. They use cross-encoders for entity ranking, but rely on traditional IR-techniques for candidate generation and did not evaluate on large scale benchmarks such as TACKBP.Gillick et al. (2019) show that dense embeddings work well for candidate generation, but they did not do pre-training and included external category labels in their bi-encoder architectures, limiting their linking to entities in Wikipedia. Our approach can be seen as generalizing both of these lines of work, and showing for the first time that pre-trained zero-shot architectures are both highly accurate and computationally efficient at scale."
Why BLINK valuable?,"BLINK is valuable because it sets new state-of-the-art performance levels for large-scale entity linking, achieves efficient linking with modest loss of accuracy, and shows that pre-trained zero-shot architectures are both highly accurate and computationally efficient at scale","The BLINK model can be said to be valuable since the model is simple yet scalable and effective compared to existing works.

What is maximum spanning tree problem?,Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) problem,"They lead to a maximum spanning tree problem in their global approach by proposing bidirectional connections between mentions. However, we cannot know maximum spanning tree only with this information.","To solve EL in the general case, evenwhen the first mention does not have the correct entity, we propose bidirectional connections between mentions, thus leading to a maximum spanning tree problem in our Global approach.Here we define a score for a (sub)tree t, noted as \Phi_{\mathrm{tr}}(t):\Phi_{\mathrm{tr}}(t)=\sum_{(i,j)\in t}\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(u_{i},u_{j}),(7)where u_{i} and u_{j} are two connected nodes (i.e., root, candidate entities or spans) in t.For a ground truth cluster c\in C (with C being the set of all such clusters), with its set444For a single cluster annotation, indeed it is possible that multiple correct trees can be drawn. of correct subtree representations \mathcal{T}_{c}, we model the cluster’s likelihood with its subtree scores. We minimize the negative log-likelihood \mathcal{L} of all clusters:\displaystyle\mathcal{L}\displaystyle=-\log\frac{\prod_{c\in C}\sum_{t\in\mathcal{T}_{c}}\exp\big{(}\Phi_{\mathrm{tr}}(t)\big{)}}{\sum_{t\in\mathcal{T}_{\textit{all}}}\exp\big{(}\Phi_{\mathrm{tr}}(t)\big{)}}.(8)Naively enumerating all possible spanning trees (\mathcal{T}_{\textit{all}} or \mathcal{T}_{c}) implied by this equation is infeasible, since their number is exponentially large.We use the adapted Kirchhoff’s Matrix Tree Theorem(MTT; Koo et al. (2007); Tutte (1984))to solve this:the sum of the weights of the spanning trees in a directed graph rooted in r is equal to the determinant of the Laplacian matrix of the graph with the row and column corresponding to r removed (i.e., the minor of the Laplacian with respect to r). This way, eq. (8) can be rewritten as\displaystyle\mathcal{L}\displaystyle=-\log\frac{\prod_{c\in C}{\det\Big{(}\mathbf{\hat{L}}_{c}\big{(}\mathbf{\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}}\big{)}\Big{)}}}{\det\Big{(}\mathbf{L}_{r}\big{(}\mathbf{\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}}\big{)}\Big{)}},(9)where \mathbf{\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}} is the weighted adjacency matrix of the graph, and \mathbf{L}_{r} is the minor of the Laplacian with respect to the root node r. An entry in the Laplacian matrix iscalculatedas\displaystyle\medmath{L_{i,j}=\begin{cases}\sum\limits_{k}\exp(\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(u_{k},u_{j}))&\text{if $i=j$}\\-\exp(\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(u_{i},u_{j}))&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}},(10)Similarly, \mathbf{\hat{L}}_{c} is a modified Laplacian matrix where the first row is replaced with the root r selection scores \Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(r,u_{j}).For clarity, Appendix A presents a toy example with detailed steps to calculate the loss in eq. (9)."
What is the difference between the local model and the global model?,"The local model only considers entity links as potential antecedents for a mention span, while the global model uses bidirectional connections between mentions to overcome the limitation of the local model",Local model optimize the marginalized probability of the correct antecedents for each given span whereas global model overcomes inherent limitation by using bidirectional connections between mentions.,"Our first approach (Local in Fig. 1(a)) is motivated by current state-of-the-artcoreference resolution models(Joshi et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020)that predict a single antecedent for each span to resolve.We extend this architecture by also considering entity links as potential antecendents:in the example of Fig. 1, the mention “Alliance” can be either connected to its antecedent mention “NATO” or to any of its candidate links (Alliance or Alliance,_Ohio).While straightforward,this approach cannot solvecases where the first coreferenced mention does not include the correct entity in its candidate list(e.g., if the order of “NATO” and “Alliance” mentions in Fig. 1 would be reversed).We therefor propose a second approach, Global, which by construction overcomes this inherent limitation by using bidirectional connections between mentions.Because that implies cycles could be formed, we resort to solving a maximum spanning tree problem.Mentions that refer to the same entity form a cluster, represented as a subtree rooted by the single entity they link to.To encode the overall document’s clusters in a single spanning tree, we introduce a virtual root node(see Fig. 1(b)).222Coreference clusters without a linked entity, i.e., a NIL cluster, have a link of a mention directly to the root. We propose twomethods for joint coreference and EL.The first, Local, is motivated by end-to-end span-based coreference resolution models(Lee et al., 2017, 2018)that optimize the marginalized probability of the correct antecedents for each given span.We extend this local marginalization to include the span’s candidate entity links. Formally, themodeledprobability ofy(text span or candidate entity)being the antecedent of span s_{i} is:P_{\mathrm{cl}}(y|s_{i})=\dfrac{\exp\big{(}\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(s_{i},y)\big{)}}{\sum_{y^{\prime}\in\mathcal{Y}(s_{i})}\exp\big{(}\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(s_{i},y^{\prime})\big{)}},(2)where \mathcal{Y}(s_{i}) is the set of antecedent spans unified with the candidate entities for s_{i}. For antecedent spans \{s_{j}:j<i\} the score \Phi_{\mathrm{cl}} is defined as:\displaystyle\medmath{\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(s_{i},s_{j})=\Phi_{\mathrm{p}}(s_{i})+\Phi_{\mathrm{p}}(s_{j})+\Phi_{\mathrm{c}}(s_{i},s_{j})},(3)\displaystyle\medmath{\Phi_{\mathrm{c}}(s_{i},s_{j})=\mathrm{FFNN}_{C}([\textbf{g}_{i};\textbf{g}_{j};\textbf{g}_{i}\odot\textbf{g}_{j};\boldsymbol{\varphi}_{i,j}])},(4)where \boldsymbol{\varphi}_{i,j} is an embedding encoding the distance333Measured in number of spans, after pruning. between spans s_{i} and s_{j}.Similarly, for a particular candidate entity e_{j}, the score \Phi_{\mathrm{cl}} is:\displaystyle\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(s_{i},e_{j})=\Phi_{\mathrm{p}}(s_{i})+\Phi_{{\ell}}(s_{i},e_{j}),(5)\displaystyle\Phi_{\ell}(s_{i},e_{j})=\mathrm{FFNN}_{L}([\textbf{g}_{i};\textbf{e}_{j}]).(6)An example graph of mentions and entities with edges for which aforementioned scores \Phi_{\mathrm{cl}} would be calculated is sketched in Fig. 1(a).While simple, this approach failsto correctly solve EL when the correct entity is only present in the candidate lists of mention spans occurring later in the text (sinceearliermentions have no access to it)."

"For a given benchmarking algorithm, did the authors try different hyper-parameters?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

No.

According to the context, the authors did not try different hyperparameters for the benchmarking algorithm. Instead, they report the average accuracy on the test set after repeating each algorithm 5 times with shuffled training data",Yes the author used hyper-parameter tuning.,We provide some classification results in Table 3 to form a benchmark on this data set. All algorithms are repeated 5 times by shuffling the training data and the average accuracy on the test set is reported.

Why did the author choose to use the standard COCO metrics for the comparison of Mask R-CNN to the state of the art on the COCO dataset ?,To provide a fair and widely accepted basis for comparing the performance of Mask R-CNN with other state-of-the-art models on the COCO dataset,"The standard COCO metrics were used for the comparison of Mask R-CNN to the state of the art on the COCO dataset, but the reason is not strongly discussed int paragraphs.","We perform a thorough comparison of Mask R-CNN to the state of the art along with comprehensive ablations on the COCO dataset [28].

Unless noted, AP is evaluating using mask IoU. As in previous work [5, 27], we train using the union of 80k train images and a 35k subset of val images (trainval35k), and report ablations on the remaining 5k val images (minival). We also report results on test-dev [28]."
What is instance segmentation ?,"Instance segmentation is a computer vision task that involves correctly detecting and precisely segmenting each individual object instance in an image, combining elements of object detection and semantic segmentation","Instance segmentation is a new type of computer vision task that aims to solve the problem of how to represent all objects in an image. It combines elements from the classical computer vision tasks of object detection and localizing each object using a bounding box, and semantic segmentation.","Instance segmentation is challenging because it requires the correct detection of all objects in an image while also precisely segmenting each instance. It therefore combines elements from the classical computer vision tasks of object detection, where the goal is to classify individual objects and localize each using a bounding box, and semantic segmentation, where the goal is to classify each pixel into a fixed set of categories without differentiating object instances.111Following common terminology, we use object detection to denote detection via bounding boxes, not masks, and semantic segmentation to denote per-pixel classification without differentiating instances. Yet we note that instance segmentation is both semantic and a form of detection. Given this, one might expect a complex method is required to achieve good results. However, we show that a surprisingly simple, flexible, and fast system can surpass prior state-of-the-art instance segmentation results."
What is the loss used during training of Faster R-CNN ?,L=L_{cls}+L_{box}+L_{mask},"For an RoI associated with ground-truth class k, L_{mask} is only defined on the k-th mask, where L is the average binary cross-entropy loss. The classification loss L Cls and bounding-box loss L_Box .","Formally, during training, we define a multi-task loss on each sampled RoI as L=L_{cls}+L_{box}+L_{mask}. The classification loss L_{cls} and bounding-box loss L_{box} are identical as those defined in [12]. The mask branch has a Km^{2}-dimensional output for each RoI, which encodes K binary masks of resolution m\times m, one for each of the K classes. To this we apply a per-pixel sigmoid, and define L_{mask} as the average binary cross-entropy loss. For an RoI associated with ground-truth class k, L_{mask} is only defined on the k-th mask (other mask outputs do not contribute to the loss)."
What are the consequences of using class labels and box layouts ?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Using class labels and box layouts can lead to the loss of spatial information during feature extraction, as fully-connected (fc) layers tend to collapse the output vectors into a single dimension",Using class labels and box layouts make collapsing into short output vector by fully connected layers inevitable.,"A mask encodes an input object’s spatial layout. Thus, unlike class labels or box offsets that are inevitably collapsed into short output vectors by fully-connected (fc) layers, extracting the spatial structure of masks can be addressed naturally by the pixel-to-pixel correspondence provided by convolutions."
What are the hyperparameters used for inference ?,"Sure! Based on the context you provided, the answer to the question ""What are the hyperparameters used for inference?"" is:

* Proposal number: 300 for C4 backbone, 1000 for FPN
* Learning rate: 0.02 (reduced by 10 at 60k and 80k iterations)
* Image scale: 800 pixels
* Non-maximum suppression threshold: 0.5","various hyperparameter are:
learning rate of 0.02 ,bounding-box NMS with a threshold of 0.5 , floating-number mask output is  resized to the RoI size, and binarized at a threshold of 0.5.","At test time, the proposal number is 300 for the C4 backbone (as in [36]) and 1000 for FPN (as in [27]). We run the box prediction branch on these proposals, followed by non-maximum suppression [14]. The mask branch is then applied to the highest scoring 100 detection boxes. Although this differs from the parallel computation used in training, it speeds up inference and improves accuracy (due to the use of fewer, more accurate RoIs). The mask branch can predict K masks per RoI, but we only use the k-th mask, where k is the predicted class by the classification branch. The m\timesm floating-number mask output is then resized to the RoI size, and binarized at a threshold of 0.5. Models are trained on all COCO trainval35k images that contain annotated keypoints. To reduce overfitting, as this training set is smaller, we train using image scales randomly sampled from [640, 800] pixels; inference is on a single scale of 800 pixels. We train for 90k iterations, starting from a learning rate of 0.02 and reducing it by 10 at 60k and 80k iterations. We use bounding-box NMS with a threshold of 0.5. Other details are identical as in §3.1."
Does adding the third branch result in better results for the Mask R-CNN over the faster R-CNN ?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

YES.

Adding the third branch for object masking in Mask R-CNN results in better results compared to faster R-CNN, as shown in the table and discussed in the text",Yes it does.,"Mask R-CNN is conceptually simple: Faster R-CNN has two outputs for each candidate object, a class label and a bounding-box offset; to this we add a third branch that outputs the object mask. Mask R-CNN is thus a natural and intuitive idea. But the additional mask output is distinct from the class and box outputs, requiring extraction of much finer spatial layout of an object. Next, we introduce the key elements of Mask R-CNN, including pixel-to-pixel alignment, which is the main missing piece of Fast/Faster R-CNN. More importantly, we have a unified model that can simultaneously predict boxes, segments, and keypoints while running at 5 fps. Adding a segment branch (for the person category) improves the AP{}^{\text{kp}} to 63.1 (Table 4) on test-dev. More ablations of multi-task learning on minival are in Table 5. Adding the mask branch to the box-only (i.e., Faster R-CNN) or keypoint-only versions consistently improves these tasks. However, adding the keypoint branch reduces the box/mask AP slightly, suggesting that while keypoint detection benefits from multitask training, it does not in turn help the other tasks. Nevertheless, learning all three tasks jointly enables a unified system to efficiently predict all outputs simultaneously (Figure 7)."
What metrics should be used for comparison of Mask R-CNN to the state of the art on the COCO dataset ?,"AP, AP{}_{50}, AP{}_{75}, and AP{}_{S}, AP{}_{M}, AP{}_{L}","Metrics used for comparison are AP , multi-scale train/test, horizontal flip test, and online hard example mining (OHEM).","We perform a thorough comparison of Mask R-CNN to the state of the art along with comprehensive ablations on the COCO dataset [28].

We also report results on test-dev [28]. We compare Mask R-CNN to the state-of-the-art methods in instance segmentation in Table 1. All instantiations of our model outperform baseline variants of previous state-of-the-art models. This includes MNC [10] and FCIS [26], the winners of the COCO 2015 and 2016 segmentation challenges, respectively. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN with ResNet-101-FPN backbone outperforms FCIS+++ [26], which includes multi-scale train/test, horizontal flip test, and online hard example mining (OHEM) [38]. While outside the scope of this work, we expect many such improvements to be applicable to ours."
What is the reason behind the Mask R-CNN outperforming all the winner of COCO 2015 - 2016 ??,"The key reasons behind Mask R-CNN outperforming all the winners of COCO 2015-2016 are the introduction of a third branch for object mask prediction, which requires pixel-to-pixel alignment, and the decoupling of mask and class prediction","The reason is that Faster R-CNN. has two outputs for each candidate object, a class label, and a bounding-box offset; to this, we add a third branch that outputs the object mask. But the additional mask output is distinct from the class and box outputs, requiring extraction of a much finer spatial layout of an object. This model performs better than the model presented due to RoIAlign but is 0.9 points box AP lower than Mask R- CNN.","Mask R-CNN is conceptually simple: Faster R-CNN has two outputs for each candidate object, a class label and a bounding-box offset; to this we add a third branch that outputs the object mask. Mask R-CNN is thus a natural and intuitive idea. But the additional mask output is distinct from the class and box outputs, requiring extraction of much finer spatial layout of an object. Next, we introduce the key elements of Mask R-CNN, including pixel-to-pixel alignment, which is the main missing piece of Fast/Faster R-CNN. In principle Mask R-CNN is an intuitive extension of Faster R-CNN, yet constructing the mask branch properly is critical for good results. Most importantly, Faster R-CNN was not designed for pixel-to-pixel alignment between network inputs and outputs. This is most evident in how RoIPool [18, 12], the de facto core operation for attending to instances, performs coarse spatial quantization for feature extraction. To fix the misalignment, we propose a simple, quantization-free layer, called RoIAlign, that faithfully preserves exact spatial locations. Despite being a seemingly minor change, RoIAlign has a large impact: it improves mask accuracy by relative 10% to 50%, showing bigger gains under stricter localization metrics. Second, we found it essential to decouple mask and class prediction: we predict a binary mask for each class independently, without competition among classes, and rely on the network’s RoI classification branch to predict the category. In contrast, FCNs usually perform per-pixel multi-class categorization, which couples segmentation and classification, and based on our experiments works poorly for instance segmentation."
Why it is sufficient to predict a binary mask without concern for the categories once the instance has been classified as a whole ?,"Once the instance has been classified as a whole, it is sufficient to predict a binary mask without concern for the categories because the box branch has already accurately classified the instance, and the mask prediction can focus solely on the instance's boundaries without being influenced by the categories","it is sufficient to predict a binary mask without concern for the categories once the instance has been classified as a whole because Mask R-CNN decouples mask and class prediction: as the existing box branch predicts the class label,a mask is generated  for each class without competition among classes (by a per-pixel sigmoid and a binary loss)","Mask R-CNN decouples mask and class prediction: as the existing box branch predicts the class label, we generate a mask for each class without competition among classes (by a per-pixel sigmoid and a binary loss). In Table 2b, we compare this to using a per-pixel softmax and a multinomial loss (as commonly used in FCN [30]). This alternative couples the tasks of mask and class prediction, and results in a severe loss in mask AP (5.5 points). This suggests that once the instance has been classified as a whole (by the box branch), it is sufficient to predict a binary mask without concern for the categories, which makes the model easier to train."
Is it better to use class specific or class agnostic masks in general ?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

It is not better to use class-specific masks in general. In fact, using class-agnostic masks can be nearly as effective, as seen in the comparison between Mask R-CNN with class-specific and class-agnostic masks on ResNet-50-C4",Both  class specific or class agnostic masks in general is nearly as effective.,"Our default instantiation predicts class-specific masks, i.e., one m\timesm mask per class. Interestingly, Mask R-CNN with class-agnostic masks (i.e., predicting a single m\timesm output regardless of class) is nearly as effective: it has 29.7 mask AP vs. 30.3 for the class-specific counterpart on ResNet-50-C4. This further highlights the division of labor in our approach which largely decouples classification and segmentation."
Can we use Faster R-CNN for human pose estimation ?,"No, we cannot use Faster R-CNN for human pose estimation. Instead, we need to use Mask R-CNN to predict K masks, one for each of K keypoint types",Yes we can use Faster R-CNN for human pose estimation.,"Our framework can easily be extended to human pose estimation.

This task helps demonstrate the flexibility of Mask R-CNN. Finally, we showcase the generality of our framework via the task of human pose estimation on the COCO keypoint dataset [28]. By viewing each keypoint as a one-hot binary mask, with minimal modification Mask R-CNN can be applied to detect instance-specific poses. Mask R-CNN surpasses the winner of the 2016 COCO keypoint competition, and at the same time runs at 5 fps.

What is the difference between Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN ?,"Mask R-CNN adds a segmentation mask output, requiring pixel-to-pixel alignment, whereas Faster R-CNN only has class and bounding box outputs","Mask R-CNN has pixel-to-pixel alignment whereas Faster R-CNN doesn't.Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting segmentation masks on each Region of Interest (RoI), in parallel with the existing branch for classification and bounding box regression","Mask R-CNN is conceptually simple: Faster R-CNN has two outputs for each candidate object, a class label and a bounding-box offset; to this we add a third branch that outputs the object mask.

Our method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN [36] by adding a branch for predicting segmentation masks on each Region of Interest (RoI), in parallel with the existing branch for classification and bounding box regression (Figure 1). The mask branch is a small FCN applied to each RoI, predicting a segmentation mask in a pixel-to-pixel manner. Mask R-CNN is simple to implement and train given the Faster R-CNN framework, which facilitates a wide range of flexible architecture designs. Additionally, the mask branch only adds a small computational overhead, enabling a fast system and rapid experimentation.

How can we solve the chllenges of image segmentation ?,"Use a Mask R-CNN baseline, as it surpasses prior state-of-the-art instance segmentation results and does not exhibit systematic artifacts on overlapping instances like FCIS+++","In this paper, It is shown that a surprisingly simple, flexible, and fast system can surpass prior state-of-the-art instance segmentation results. We use object detection to denote detection via bounding boxes, not masks, and semantic segmentation to denote per-pixel classification without differentiating instances. Given this, one might expect a complex method to be required to achieve good results.","Instance segmentation is challenging because it requires the correct detection of all objects in an image while also precisely segmenting each instance. It therefore combines elements from the classical computer vision tasks of object detection, where the goal is to classify individual objects and localize each using a bounding box, and semantic segmentation, where the goal is to classify each pixel into a fixed set of categories without differentiating object instances.111Following common terminology, we use object detection to denote detection via bounding boxes, not masks, and semantic segmentation to denote per-pixel classification without differentiating instances. Yet we note that instance segmentation is both semantic and a form of detection. Given this, one might expect a complex method is required to achieve good results. However, we show that a surprisingly simple, flexible, and fast system can surpass prior state-of-the-art instance segmentation results. Most recently, Li et al. [26] combined the segment proposal system in [8] and object detection system in [11] for “fully convolutional instance segmentation” (FCIS). The common idea in [8, 11, 26] is to predict a set of position-sensitive output channels fully convolutionally. These channels simultaneously address object classes, boxes, and masks, making the system fast. But FCIS exhibits systematic errors on overlapping instances and creates spurious edges (Figure 6), showing that it is challenged by the fundamental difficulties of segmenting instances. Mask R-CNN outputs are visualized in Figures 2 and 5. Mask R-CNN achieves good results even under challenging conditions. In Figure 6 we compare our Mask R-CNN baseline and FCIS+++ [26]. FCIS+++ exhibits systematic artifacts on overlapping instances, suggesting that it is challenged by the fundamental difficulty of instance segmentation. Mask R-CNN shows no such artifacts."
Was the GPT3 model finetuned on Self-Instruct also finetuned only on 50k instances?,No,"Based on the introduction, it appears as though the authors may have finetuned their GPT3-Self Instruct model with 82k samples.","To evaluate SELF-INSTRUCT empirically, we run this framework on GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), which is a vanilla LM (§4). The iterative SELF-INSTRUCT process on this model leads to about 52k instructions, paired with about 82K instance inputs and target outputs. We observe that the resulting data provides a diverse range of creative tasks and over 50% of them have less than 0.3 ROUGE-L overlaps with the seed instructions (§4.2). On this resulting data, we build GPT3SELF-INST by fine-tuning GPT3 (i.e., the same model used for generating the instructional data). We evaluate GPT3SELF-INST in comparison to various other models on both typical NLP tasks included in SUPER-NATURALINSTRUCTIONS (Wang et al., 2022), and a set of new instructions that are created for novel usage of instruction-following models (§5). The SUPERNI results indicate that GPT3SELF-INST outperforms GPT3 (the original model) by a large margin (+33.1%) and nearly matches the performance of InstructGPT001. Moreover, our human evaluation on the newly-created instruction set shows that GPT3SELF-INST demonstrates a broad range of instruction-following ability, outperforming models trained on other publicly available instruction datasets and leaving only a 5% gap behind InstructGPT001."
Why is it crucial for the pipeline to identify whether the instruction represents a classification task? How are classification tasks particularly distinct or special?,"The pipeline needs to identify classification tasks because they require a specific approach to generate inputs that are not biased towards one label. Classification tasks are distinct because they have limited and small output label spaces, and the model needs to generate inputs that are representative of all classes","The main reason why this is a crucial step is because the authors’ pipeline uses a different approach for classification tasks. For non-classification tasks, the authors first prompt a language model to come up with the input fields require, then provide sample inputs, for which the language model generates outputs. However, for classification tasks, the authors first generate the list of classes, and then require the model to provide an example for that instruction for each class. They do this because the first approach, used for non-classification instructions, does not work well for unbalanced classes. This step, of identifying classification tasks, is important since it is not possible to use the same generation technique for both classification and non-classification tasks effectively with the same generation method.","Our pipeline for generating the instruction data consists of four steps: 1) instruction generation, 2) identifying whether the instruction represents a classification task or not, 3) instance generation with the input-first or the output-first approach, and 4) filtering low-quality data. Because we need two different approaches for classification and non-classification tasks, we next identify whether the generated instruction represents a classification task or not.333More concretely, we regard tasks that have a limited and small output label space as classification tasks.We prompt vanilla GPT3 few-shot to determine this, using 12 classification instructions and 19 non-classification instructions from the seed tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 7. Given the instructions and their task type, we generate instances for each instruction independently. This is challenging because it requires the model to understand what the target task is, based on the instruction, figure out what additional input fields are needed and generate them, and finally complete the task by producing the output. We found that pretrained language models can achieve this to a large extent when prompted with instruction-input-output in-context examples from other tasks.A natural way to do this is the Input-first Approach, where we can ask a language model to come up with the input fields first based on the instruction, and then produce the corresponding output. This generation order is similar to how models are used to respond to instruction and input, but here with in-context examples from other tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 8. However, we found that this approach can generate inputs biased toward one label, especially for classification tasks (e.g., for grammar error detection, it usually generates grammatical input). Therefore, we additionally propose an Output-first Approach for classification tasks, where we first gener-ate the possible class labels, and then condition the input generation on each class label. The prompting template is shown in Table 9.4 We apply the output-first approach to the classification tasks identified in the former step, and the input-first approach to the remaining non-classification tasks."

These datasets provide annotated instructional data for training large language models, and have been used in recent research to improve the quality of instruction-tuned models","PromptSource and Super-NaturalInstructions (also called ""super-NI"" in short) are two existing public datasets that contain instructions for tuning large language models.","The recent NLP literature has witnessed a tremendous amount of activity in building models that can follow natural language instructions (Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022, i.a.).These developments are powered by two key components: large pre-trained language models (LM) and human-written instruction data.PromptSource (Bach et al., 2022) and Super-NaturalInstructions (Wang et al., 2022) are two notable recent datasets that use extensive manual annotation for collecting instructions to construct T0 Bach et al. (2022); Sanh et al. (2022) and Tk-Instruct Wang et al. (2022).However, this process is costly and often suffers limited diversity given that most human generations tend to be popular NLP tasks, falling short of covering a true variety of tasks and different ways to describe them.Given these limitations, continuing to improve the quality of instruction-tuned modelsnecessitates the development of alternative approaches for supervising instruction-tuned models. A series of works have found evidence that vanilla language models can be effective at following general language instructions if tuned with annotated “instructional” data – datasets containing language instructional commands and their desired outcome based on human judgement Weller et al.

What is the similarities and differences between the NaturalInstructions dataset and the SuperNaturalInstructions dataset?,"The NaturalInstructions dataset and the SuperNaturalInstructions dataset share similarities in their focus on instruction-following tasks, but they differ in their scope and diversity.

The NaturalInstructions dataset is a comprehensive collection of existing NLP tasks, while the SuperNaturalInstructions dataset is a curated set of instructions specifically designed for user-oriented applications and diversified in style and format.

The SuperNaturalInstructions dataset aims to tackle the bottleneck of human annotation dependence and provide a testbed for evaluating instruction-based models' generalizability to unseen tasks, while the NaturalInstructions dataset is more focused on research purposes and skewed towards classification tasks","This paper only mentions and discusses the SuperNaturalInstructions (or SuperNI) dataset, and does not explicitly discuss the NaturalInstructions dataset. However, based on the naming, it is possible that both the Supe- NaturalInstructiuons and NaturalInstructions datasets are datasets that contain annotated instructional data to help large language models (LLMs) perform a wider range of specialized tasks.","Despite the comprehensiveness of SuperNI in collecting existing NLP tasks, most of these NLP tasks were proposed for research purposes and skewed toward classification. To better access the practical value of instruction-following models, a subset of the authors curate a new set of instructions motivated by user-oriented applications.We first brainstorm different domains where large LMs may be useful (e.g., email writing, social media, productivity tools, entertainment, programming), then craft instructions related to each domain along with an input-output instance (again, input is optional). We aim to diversify the styles and formats of these tasks (e.g., instructions may be long or short; input/output may take the form of bullet points, tables, codes, equations, etc.). In total, we create 252 instructions with 1 instance per instruction. We believe it can serve as a testbed for evaluating how instruction-based models handle diverse and unfamiliar instructions. Table 4 presents a small portion of the 252 tasks. The whole test set will be available upon request. A series of works have found evidence that vanilla language models can be effective at following general language instructions if tuned with annotated “instructional” data – datasets containing language instructional commands and their desired outcome based on human judgement Weller et al.

"If LMs have been found to be biased and limited in creativity, how would LMs be able to create instructions that cover a greater diversity of tasks compared to humans who might be able to imagine possible tasks?","LMs may not be able to create instructions that cover a greater diversity of tasks compared to humans. Despite their ability to generate novel tasks, LMs may be limited by their biases and lack of creativity, particularly when it comes to uncommon and creative instructions","LMs might be able to create instructions covering a greater diversity of tasks since they are trained on a large corpus of material that encompasses the work of many humans. Additionally, the authors' proposed approach, Self-Instruct, uses a bootstrapping phase where humans provide the first set of instructions, and a LM uses those as examples to generate more instructions. Approaches such as these, combining the efforts of a human and a language model, might be one way to ensure LMs create a wider array of tasks. However, the authors do acknowledge that LMs are prone to be biased towards commonly occurring sequences, at the cost of rarer sequences, meaning that this is an open research question.","Annotating large-scale instruction data can be challenging for humans because it requires 1) creativity to come up with novel tasks and 2) expertise for writing the labeled instances for each task.In this section, we detail our process for Self-Instruct, which refers to the pipeline of generating tasks with a vanilla pretrained language model itself and then conducting instruction tuning with this generated data in order to align the language model to follow instructions better. This pipeline is depicted in Figure 1. Self-Instruct is based on a finding that large pretrained language models can be prompted to generate new and novel instructions when presented with some existing instructions in the context. This provides us with a way to grow the instruction data from a small set of seed human-written instructions.We propose to generate a diverse set of instructions in a bootstrapping fashion. We initiate the task pool with 175 tasks (1 instruction and 1 instance for each task) written by our authors. For every step, we sample 8 task instructions from this pool as in-context examples.Of the 8 instructions, 6 are from the human-written tasks,and 2 are from the model-generated tasks in previous steps to promote diversity.The prompting template is shown in Table 6. To encourage diversity, a new instruction is added to the task pool only when its ROUGE-L overlap with any existing instruction is less than 0.7.We also exclude instructions that contain some specific keywords (e.g., images, pictures, graphs) that usually can not be processed by language models. When generating new instances for each instruction, we filter out instances that are exactly the same or those with the same input but different outputs. Despite the comprehensiveness of SuperNI in collecting existing NLP tasks, most of these NLP tasks were proposed for research purposes and skewed toward classification. To better access the practical value of instruction-following models, a subset of the authors curate a new set of instructions motivated by user-oriented applications.We first brainstorm different domains where large LMs may be useful (e.g., email writing, social media, productivity tools, entertainment, programming), then craft instructions related to each domain along with an input-output instance (again, input is optional). We aim to diversify the styles and formats of these tasks (e.g., instructions may be long or short; input/output may take the form of bullet points, tables, codes, equations, etc.). In total, we create 252 instructions with 1 instance per instruction. We believe it can serve as a testbed for evaluating how instruction-based models handle diverse and unfamiliar instructions. Table 4 presents a small portion of the 252 tasks. The whole test set will be available upon request. Self-Instruct depends on LMs, and it will inherit all the limitations that carry over with LMs.As recent studies have shown Razeghi et al. (2022); Kandpal et al. (2022), tail phenomena pose a serious challenge to the success of LMs. In other words, LMs’ largest gains correspond to the frequent uses of languages (head of the language use distribution), and there are minimal gains in the low-frequency contexts.Similarly, in the context of this work, it would not be surprising if the majority of the gains by Self-Instruct are skewed towardtasks or instructions that present more frequently in the pre-training corpus.As a consequence, the approach might show brittleness with respect to uncommon and creative instructions."
What type of new tasks was Self-Instruct able to generate which were not seen in previous human-created instruction datasets?,Novel tasks with less than 0.3 ROUGE-L overlaps with the seed instructions,"The paper mentions that their model is used to generate 52,000 instructions and 82,000 input-output pairs, for a wide range of tasks, which the authors have made publicly available. It might be possible to find more information on the specific tasks that were created by looking at this synthetic dataset, but the paper itself does not contain concrete examples.","A series of recent works Zhou et al. (2022b); Ye et al. (2022); Singh et al. (2022); Honovich et al. (2022) generate instructions of a task given a few examples. While Self-Instruct also involves instruction generation, a major difference in our case is it is task-agnostic; we generate new tasks (instructions along with instances) from scratch. Annotating large-scale instruction data can be challenging for humans because it requires 1) creativity to come up with novel tasks and 2) expertise for writing the labeled instances for each task.In this section, we detail our process for Self-Instruct, which refers to the pipeline of generating tasks with a vanilla pretrained language model itself and then conducting instruction tuning with this generated data in order to align the language model to follow instructions better. This pipeline is depicted in Figure 1. To evaluate Self-Instruct empirically, we run this framework on GPT3 Brown et al. (2020), which is a vanilla LM (§4).The iterative Self-Instruct process on this model leads to about 52k instructions, paired with about 82K instance inputs and target outputs.We observe that the resulting data provides a diverse range of creative tasks and over 50% of them have less than 0.3 ROUGE-L overlaps with the seed instructions (§4.2).On this resulting data, we build GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} by fine-tuning GPT3 (i.e., the same model used for generating the instructional data).We evaluate GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} in comparison to various other models on both typical NLP tasks included in Super-NaturalInstructions Wang et al. (2022), and a set of new instructions that are created for novel usage of instruction-following models (§5).The SuperNI results indicate thatGPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} outperforms GPT3 (the original model) by a large margin (+33.1%) and nearly matches the performance of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. Moreover, our human evaluation on the newly-created instruction set shows that GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} demonstrates a broad range of instruction following ability, outperforming models trained on other publicly available instruction datasets and leaving only a 5% gap behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. In summary, our contributions are: (1) Self-Instruct, a method for inducing instruction-following capabilitywith minimal human-labeled data;(2) We demonstrate its effectiveness via extensive instruction-tuning experiments;(3) We release a large synthetic dataset of 52K instructions and a set of manually-written novel tasks for building and evaluating future instruction-following models."
"Beyond correctness, why did the authors not evaluate the actual quality, meaning, or usefulness of the generated instructions?","The authors did not evaluate the actual quality, meaning, or usefulness of the generated instructions because they were focused on evaluating the models' ability to follow instructions, rather than the quality of the instructions themselves","One reason to explain why the authors did not perform more comprehensive quality evaluation of the generated outputs is the difficulty in judging the output of the model. Some tasks cannot be quickly verified by the average human (one example the authors provide for this is converting first-order logic into natural language - a task that only experts with the appropriate domain knowledge can perform). However, despite this challenge, the authors do perform some analysis to gauge the overall quality of the generated samples. They randomly select 200 instructions, and for each sample they examine the quality of one instance within each instruction. Doing this evaluation reveals that their approach performs much better than a vanilla GPT3 (i.e. a bare-bones GPT3 with nothing else).","So far, we have shown the quantity and diversity of the generated data, but its quality remains uncertain. To investigate this, we randomly sample 200 instructions and randomly select 1 instance per instruction. We asked an expert annotator (co-author of this work) to label whether each instance is correct or not, in terms of the instruction, the instance input, and the instance output.Evaluation results in Table 2 show that most of the generated instructions are meaningful, while the generated instances may contain more noise (to a reasonable extent). However, we found that even though the generations may contain errors, most of them are still in the correct format or even partially correct, which can provide useful guidance for training models to follow instructions. We listed a number of good generations and bad generations in Table 10 and Table 11 respectively. Evaluating models’ performance on this evaluation set of diverse tasks is extremely challenging because different tasks require different expertise. Indeed, many of these tasks cannot be measured by automatic metrics or even be judged by normal crowdworkers (e.g., writing a program, or converting first-order logic into natural language). To get a more faithful evaluation, we asked the authors of the instructions to judge model predictions. The evaluators were asked to rate the output based on whether it accurately and effectively completes the task. We implemented a four-level rating system for categorizing the quality of the models’ outputs, defined as follows: Figure 5 provides the performance of GPT3 model and its instruction-tuned counterparts on this newly written instruction set. As anticipated, the vanilla GPT3 language model is largely unable to respond to instructions, and all instruction-tuned models demonstrate comparatively higher performance,Nonetheless, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} (i.e., GPT3 model fine-tuned with Self-Instruct) outperforms those counterparts trained on T0 or SuperNI by a large margin, demonstrating the value of the generated data despite the noise.Compared with \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}} (c.f. footnote 1), GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is quite close in the performance—if we count acceptable response with minor imperfections (Rating-3) as valid, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is only 5% behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. Lastly, our evaluation confirms the impressive instruction-following ability of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{002}} & \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{003}} models. Although there are many factors behind this success, we conjecture that future work can largely benefit from improving the quality of our generated data by using human annotators or training a reward model to select better generations, similar to the algorithm used in Ouyang et al. (2022)."
How are T0 and Tk-INSTRUCT different?,"T0 and Tk-INSTRUCT are different in their instruction data and training objectives. T0 is trained on extensive manual annotation of instructions, while Tk-INSTRUCT is trained on a diverse set of instructions from the web","T0 and Tk-Instruct are two related models, proposed in papers published in 2022. T0 was proposed by Bach et al. and Sanh et al, while Tk-Instruct was proposed by Wang et al. Both these approaches used a large T5-model, with billions of parameters in their proposed approach, and both approaches were also trained using instructional datasets (PromptSource, Super-NaturalInstructions) that were annotated manually by humans. The fact that they were published in the same year, use the same datasets, and probably try to achieve similar goals indicates that, either: (1) the work for both of these approaches was done concurrently (perhaps by different groups of authors) or (2) one work was inspired from the other and might have been an extension of that. More details about either of these, including the differences are not discussed in detail in this paper, but can probably be found by referring the the respective papers mentioned for each of these.","The recent NLP literature has witnessed a tremendous amount of activity in building models that can follow natural language instructions (Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022, i.a.).These developments are powered by two key components: large pre-trained language models (LM) and human-written instruction data.PromptSource (Bach et al., 2022) and Super-NaturalInstructions (Wang et al., 2022) are two notable recent datasets that use extensive manual annotation for collecting instructions to construct T0 Bach et al.

T0 and Tk-Instruct are two instruction-tuned models proposed in Sanh et al. (2022) and Wang et al.

For both of these models, we use their largest version with 11B parameters."
Was the performance difference between Self-Instruct training and SuperNI training significant?,"Yes, the performance difference between Self-Instruct training and SuperNI training was significant. According to the results in Table 3, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} outperformed the models trained on SuperNI training set by a large margin, demonstrating the value of the generated data despite the noise. Additionally, compared to the GPT3 model fine-tuned with SuperNI training set, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} achieved better performance on the newly created instruction set, leaving only a 5% gap behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}","While it does appear as though there is a measurable performance improvement from SuperNI to Self-Instruct, quantifying the impact and magnitude of that improvement is not straightforward. Evaluations with ROGUE-L scores find that the absolute difference between both these methods is not very high, though additional information and context may be needed to judge the meaning of the absolute difference between these numbers. The authors do claim that they outperform T0 or SuperNI by a large margin, which is strong evidence to suggest that the difference was indeed significant, but such claims must be taken with some grains of salt since authors are usually incentivized to show their models are the best.","To evaluate Self-Instruct empirically, we run this framework on GPT3 Brown et al.

Additionally, to compare Self-Instruct training with other publicly available instruction tuning data, we further finetune GPT3 model with data from PromptSource and SuperNI, which are used to train the T0 and Tk-Instruct models. We call them T0 training and SuperNI training for short, respectively.To save the training budget, we sampled 50K instances (but covering all their instructions) for each dataset, which has a comparable size to the instruction data we generated. Based on the findings from Wang et al. (2022) and our early experiments, reducing the number of instances per task does not degrade the model’s generalization performance to unseen tasks. We make the following observations from the results in Table 3.Self-Instructboosts the instruction-following ability of GPT3 by a large margin. The vanilla GPT3 model basically cannot follow human instructions at all. Upon manual analysis, we find that it usually generates irrelevant and repetitive text, and does not know when to stop generation.Compared with other models that are not specifically trained for SuperNI, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} achieves better performance than T0 or the GPT3 finetuned on the T0 training set, which takes tremendous human labeling efforts. Notably, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} also nearly matches the performance of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}, which is trained with private user data and human-annotated labels. Models trained on SuperNI training set still achieve better performance on its evaluation set, which we attribute to the similar instruction style and formatting. However, we show that Self-Instruct still brings in additional gains when combined with the SuperNI training set, proving its value as complementary data. Figure 5 provides the performance of GPT3 model and its instruction-tuned counterparts on this newly written instruction set. As anticipated, the vanilla GPT3 language model is largely unable to respond to instructions, and all instruction-tuned models demonstrate comparatively higher performance,Nonetheless, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} (i.e., GPT3 model fine-tuned with Self-Instruct) outperforms those counterparts trained on T0 or SuperNI by a large margin, demonstrating the value of the generated data despite the noise.Compared with \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}} (c.f. footnote 1), GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is quite close in the performance—if we count acceptable response with minor imperfections (Rating-3) as valid, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is only 5% behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}.

Although there are many factors behind this success, we conjecture that future work can largely benefit from improving the quality of our generated data by using human annotators or training a reward model to select better generations, similar to the algorithm used in Ouyang et al. (2022). We introduce Self-Instruct, a task-agnostic method to improve the instruction-following capabilities of language models via its own generation of instruction data (instruction, input, and output samples) and bootstrapping with it. Our method conducts instruction-tuning of the original model on the pruned subset of generated samples. On experimenting with vanilla GPT3, we observe a 33% absolute improvement over the original model on Super-NaturalInstructions. This performance is on par with \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}, which is trained with private user data and expensive human annotations. Furthermore, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks. Human evaluation on this set shows that tuning GPT3 with Self-Instruct outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5% absolute gap behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. We hope Self-Instruct can serve as the first step to align pretrained language models to follow human instructions, and future work can build on top of this data to improve instruction-following models."
"If performance can be attributed to instruction style and formatting, why did the authors not test baselines that were not fine-tuned but had few-shot examples?","Sure! Here's the answer to the question based on the provided context:

The authors did not test baselines that were not fine-tuned but had few-shot examples because the instruction style and formatting differences between the training and evaluation sets were already providing a significant performance boost, making it unlikely that additional gains would be achieved through few-shot examples alone","It is unclear why the authors did not test their baselines with few shot examples. They acknowledge this as a problem, but they justify their position by pointing out that using both SuperNI and their approach together leads to increased performance gains - indicating that their approach (Self-Instruct) and SuperNI are complementary and can be used jointly to achieve higher performance than any one method being used on its' own.","Models trained on SuperNI training set still achieve better performance on its evaluation set, which we attribute to the similar instruction style and formatting. However, we show that Self-Instruct still brings in additional gains when combined with the SuperNI training set, proving its value as complementary data."
What is the PromptSource dataset and what kind of data does it include?,PromptSource is a dataset that includes extensive manual annotation for collecting instructions to construct T0 models. It includes human-written instruction data,"The PromptSource dataset is a dataset of human-written instructions for various tasks. It probably includes instructions (and examples) for various sorts of tasks. The current paper, which focuses on attempting to automate this dataset-generation process, does not discuss details on the kind of tasks the PromptSource dataset includes, but details on the dataset could probably be found in the paper Bach et al., 2022.","The recent NLP literature has witnessed a tremendous amount of activity in building models that can follow natural language instructions (Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022, i.a.).These developments are powered by two key components: large pre-trained language models (LM) and human-written instruction data.PromptSource (Bach et al., 2022) and Super-NaturalInstructions (Wang et al., 2022) are two notable recent datasets that use extensive manual annotation for collecting instructions to construct T0 Bach et al.
