For basic reading skills, there was a significant indirect effect of WM on reading through the mediation of PA (but not through RAN). By contrast, for reading fluency, there was a significant indirect effect of WM on reading through the mediation of RAN (but not through PA).

For example, a picture of a cat and the word \\\"cat\\\" both engage similar conceptual representations. While existing research has found evidence for modality-independent representations, their content remains unknown. Modality-independent representations could be semantic, or they might also contain perceptual features. We developed a novel approach combining word/picture cross-condition decoding with neural network classifiers that learned latent modality-independent representations from MEG data (25 human participants: 15 female, 10 male). We then compared these representations to models representing semantic, sensory, and orthographic features. Results show that modality-independent representations correlate both with semantic and visual representations. There was no evidence that these results were due to picture-specific visual features or orthographic features automatically activated by the stimuli presented in the experiment. These findings support the notion that modality-independent concepts contain both perceptual and semantic representations.\",\n",
    "lm_3= \"When comprehending speech, listeners can use information encoded in visual cues from a face to enhance auditory speech comprehension. For example, prior work has shown that the mouth movements reflect articulatory features of speech segments and durational information, while pitch and speech amplitude are primarily cued by eyebrow and head movements. Little is known about how the visual perception of segmental and prosodic speech information is influenced by linguistic experience. Using eye-tracking, we studied how perceivers' visual scanning of different regions on a talking face predicts accuracy in a task targeting both segmental versus prosodic information, and also asked how this was influenced by language familiarity. Twenty-four native English perceivers heard two audio sentences in either English or Mandarin (an unfamiliar, non-native language), which sometimes differed in segmental or prosodic information (or both). Perceivers then saw a silent video of a talking face, and judged whether that video matched either the first or second audio sentence (or whether both sentences were the same). First, increased looking to the mouth predicted correct responses only for non-native language trials. Second, the start of a successful search for speech information in the mouth area was significantly delayed in non-native versus native trials, but just when there were only prosodic differences in the auditory sentences, and not when there were segmental differences. Third, (in correct trials) the saccade amplitude in native language trials was significantly greater than in non-native trials, indicating more intensely focused fixations in the latter. Taken together, these results suggest that mouth-looking was generally more evident when processing a non-native versus native language in all analyses, but fascinatingly, when measuring perceivers' latency to fixate the mouth, this language effect was largest in trials where only prosodic information was useful for the task.\",\n",

In 2022, a comprehensive multi-media breast cancer (BC) awareness campaign was implemented, featuring local cancer experts and survivors, with community-based screening events in the towns of Adama and Mojo. The RE-AIM framework was used to evaluate and describe its reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Educational pamphlets, videos, social media posts, and interviews were distributed in person and through local and national media networks, reaching tens of millions of people and resulting in 525 individuals screened, with one diagnosis of early-stage cancer. During the free screening events, an interview-administered survey of BC knowledge, attitudes, and screening practices was conducted to inform future cancer education for this population. Among 287 survey respondents, about half correctly identified swelling (46%) or changing nipples/discharge (48.4%) as signs of BC. Maintenance challenges include the lack of a national screening program. Educational resources and a mobile app, translated into the local language, encourage continued patient empowerment to perform breast self-exams. In the absence of established BC prevention programs, \\\"pop-up\\\" mobile screening events can be effective for mobilizing communities to get screened.

Our study shows that weather can affect emotional cognition, but intrinsic emotional word properties are resilient to environmental influences. This highlights the complex interplay between environmental factors and linguistic processing and reaffirms the importance of environmental contexts in cognitive and emotional evaluations, especially in the face of climate change. By integrating VR technology with environmental psychology and linguistics, our research offers novel insights into the subtle yet significant ways in which virtual and real-world environments converge to shape human emotional and cognitive responses.\",\n",

The craniofacial relationship in patients with dentofacial deformities is still not understood, and transformations between facial and skeletal shapes remain a challenging task due to intricate anatomical structures and nonlinear relationships between the facial soft tissue and bones. In this study, a novel bidirectional 3-dimensional (3D) deep learning framework, named P2P-ConvGC, was developed and validated based on a large-scale data set for accurate subject-specific transformations between facial and skeletal shapes. Specifically, the 2-stage point-sampling strategy was used to generate multiple nonoverlapping point subsets to represent high-resolution facial and skeletal shapes. Facial and skeletal point subsets were separately input into the prediction system to predict the corresponding skeletal and facial point subsets via the skeletal prediction subnetwork and facial prediction subnetwork. For quantitative evaluation, the accuracy was calculated with shape errors and landmark errors between the predicted skeleton or face with corresponding ground truths. The shape error was calculated by comparing the predicted point sets with the ground truths, with P2P-ConvGC outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms including P2P-Net, P2P-ASNL, and P2P-Conv. The total landmark errors (Euclidean distances of craniomaxillofacial landmarks) of P2P-ConvGC in the upper skull, mandible, and facial soft tissues were 1.964 \\u00b1 0.904 mm, 2.398 \\u00b1 1.174 mm, and 2.226 \\u00b1 0.774 mm, respectively.

Type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) family is involved in many coronavirus infections and has trypsin-like catalytic activity. Here we examine all 18 members of the TTSPs family through CRISPR-based activation of endogenous protein expression in cells, and find that, in addition to TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, TMPRSS13 significantly facilitates SADS-CoV infection. This is confirmed by ectopic expression of TMPRSS13, and specific to trypsin-dependent SADS-CoV. Infection with pseudovirus bearing SADS-CoV spike protein indicates that TMPRSS13 acts at the entry step and is sensitive to serine protease inhibitor Camostat. Moreover, both human and pig TMPRSS13 are able to enhance the cell-cell membrane fusion and cleavage of spike protein.

The proposed DNA aptamers with a G-quadruplex spatial structure could be recognized by SYBR Green I (SG-I), resulting in strong green fluorescence emitted by SG-I. The DNA aptamers exhibit a higher specific binding ability to target OP molecules through aromatic ring stacking, disrupting the interaction between SG-I and DNA aptamers to induce green fluorescence quenching.

    "ce_8= \"The role of phenotypic plasticity during colonization remains unclear due to the shifting importance of plasticity across timescales. In the early stages of colonization, plasticity can facilitate persistence in a novel environment; but over evolutionary time, processes such as genetic assimilation may reduce variation in plastic traits such that species with a longer evolutionary history in an environment can show lower levels of plasticity than recent invaders. Therefore, comparing species in the early stages of colonization to long-established species provides a powerful approach for uncovering the role of phenotypic plasticity during different stages of colonization. We compared gene expression between low-dissolved oxygen (DO) and high-DO populations of two cyprinid fish: Enteromius apleurogramma, a species that has undergone a recent range expansion, and E.\\u2009neumayeri, a long-established native species in the same region. We sampled tissue either immediately after capture from the field or after a 2-week acclimation under high-DO conditions, allowing us to test for both evolved and plastic differences in low-DO vs high-DO populations of each species. We found that most genes showing candidate-evolved differences in gene expression did not overlap with those showing plastic differences in gene expression. However, in the genes that did overlap, there was counter-gradient variation such that plastic and evolved gene expression responses were in opposite directions in both species. Additionally, E.\\u2009apleurogramma had higher levels of plasticity and evolved divergence in gene expression between field populations. We suggest that the higher level of plasticity and counter-gradient variation may have allowed rapid genetic adaptation in E.\\u2009apleurogramma and facilitated colonization. This study shows how counter-gradient variation may impact the colonization of divergent oxygen environments.\",\n",

Surprisingly, these intestinal microorganisms have been found to influence tissues that are not directly in contact with the gut, such as adipose tissue, the liver, skeletal muscle, and the brain. This interaction takes place even when intestinal barrier function is uncompromised. An increasing body of evidence suggests that bacterial membrane vesicles (bMVs), in addition to bacterial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, are able to mediate effects of the microbiota on these host tissues. The ability of bMVs to dissipate from the intestinal lumen into systemic circulation hereby facilitates the transport and presentation of bacterial components and metabolites to host organs. Importantly, there are indications that the interaction between bMVs and tissues or immune cells may play a role in the etiology of (chronic metabolic) disease. For example, the gut-derived bMV-mediated induction of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells and pro-inflammatory signaling by adipocytes possibly underlies diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Here, we review the current knowledge on bMVs in the microbiota's effects on host energy/substrate metabolism with a focus on etiological roles in the onset and progression of metabolic disease.

Diethyl phthalate, 1-hexadecanol, dibutyl phthalate, n-tetracosanol-1, 1-nonadecene, pyrrol[1,2-a] pyrazine-1,4-dione, hexahydro-3-(2-methyl) and tetratetracontane were found to be common compounds among one or the other endolichenic fungi, which possibly were responsible for antibacterial activity. GC-MS data were further analysed through Principal Component Analysis which showed D. eschscholtzii to be with unique pattern of expression of metabolites. Compound confirmation test revealed coumaric acid to be responsible for antibacterial activity in D. eschscholtzii. So, the study proves that endolichenic fungi that inhabit lichenized fungal thalli could be a source of potential antibacterial compounds.\",\n",
    "sp_14= \"Cow's milk is one of the most hydrating beverages, but many individuals choose not to consume dairy in their diet due to intolerance, allergy, or dietary preference. Milk is commonly replaced with plant-based beverages, including soya which has the most comparable protein content, but little is known about their hydration potential. This study compared fluid and electrolyte balance responses between a soya beverage and skimmed cow's milk.\",\n",
    "sp_15= \"Pollen tube growth is an essential step leading to reproductive success in flowering plants, in which vesicular trafficking plays a key role. Vesicular trafficking from endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus is mediated by the coat protein complex II (COPII). A key component of COPII is small GTPase Sar1. Five Sar1 isoforms are encoded in the Arabidopsis genome and they show distinct while redundant roles in various cellular and developmental processes, especially in reproduction. Arabidopsis Sar1b is essential for sporophytic control of pollen development while Sar1b and Sar1c are critical for gametophytic control of pollen development. Because functional loss of Sar1b and Sar1c resulted in pollen abortion, whether they influence pollen tube growth was unclear. Here we demonstrate that Sar1b mediates pollen tube growth, in addition to its role in pollen development. Although functional loss of Sar1b does not affect pollen germination, it causes a significant reduction in male transmission and of pollen tube penetration of style. We further show that membrane dynamics at the apex of pollen tubes are compromised by Sar1b loss-of-function. Results presented provide further support of functional complexity of the Sar1 isoforms.\",\n",
    "sp_16= \"Recently, there has been a notable rise in the prevalence of persistent pollutants in the environment, posing a significant hazard due to their toxicity and enduring nature. Conventional wastewater treatment methods employed in treatment plants rarely address these persistent pollutants adequately. Meanwhile, the concept of green synthesis has garnered considerable attention, owing to its environmentally friendly approach that utilizes fewer toxic chemicals and solvents. The utilization of materials derived from sustainable sources presents a promising avenue for solving pressing environmental concerns. Among the various sources of biological agents, plants stand out for their accessibility, eco-friendliness, and rich reserves of phytochemicals suitable for material synthesis. The plant extract-mediated synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) has emerged as a promising solution for applications in wastewater treatment. Thorough investigations into the factors influencing the properties of these green ZnONPs are essential to establish a detailed and reliable synthesis process. Major weaknesses inherent in ZnONPs can be addressed by changing the optical, magnetic, and interface properties through doping with various semiconductor materials. Consequently, research efforts to mitigate water pollution are being driven by both the future prospects and limitations of ZnO-based composites. This review underscores the recent advancements of plant extract-mediated ZnONP composites for water treatment.\",\n",
    "sp_17= \"Bladder cancer stands as a prevailing neoplasm among men globally, distinguished for its pronounced malignancy attributed to invasiveness and metastatic proclivity. Tannic acid (TA), an organic compound in many plants, has garnered recent attention for its discernible anti-mutagenic attributes. This investigation endeavored to scrutinize the repercussions of TA on grade II bladder cancer, with a concerted focus on unraveling its anti-cancer mechanisms. The cytotoxic effects of TA on grade II bladder cancer cells were investigated using multiple techniques, including MTT assay, flow cytometry, TUNEL assay, and western blot. Our findings revealed that elevated concentrations of TA induced cytotoxic effects in grade II bladder cancer cells. Both flow cytometry and the TUNEL assay substantiated the dose-dependent capacity of TA to prompt apoptosis. Western blot analysis corroborated that TA treatment in bladder cancer cells resulted in the upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 expression and PARP. Furthermore, heightened TA dosage elicited an augmentation in the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, namely Bax and Bak, alongside a reduction in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 within bladder cancer cells. This study confirms TA as a potential anticancer agent, demonstrably diminishing the viability of bladder cancer cells. TA exerts cytotoxicity through the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. Specifically, TA initiates the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, concurrently augmenting the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins to facilitate apoptosis. Collectively, the present study indicates that TA effectively impedes the proliferation of bladder cancer cells by instigating apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.\",\n",
    "sp_18= \"Integrated omics analyses outline the cellular and metabolic events of hemp plants in response to salt stress and highlight several photosynthesis and energy metabolism related pathways as key regulatory points. Soil salinity affects many physiological processes of plants and leads to crop yield losses worldwide. For hemp, a crop that is valued for multiple aspects, such as its medical compounds, fibre, and seed, a comprehensive understanding of its salt stress responses is a prerequisite for resistance breeding and tailoring its agronomic performance to suit certain industrial applications. Here, we first observed the phenotype of salt-stressed hemp plants and found that under NaCl treatment, hemp plants displayed pronounced growth defects, as indicated by the significantly reduced average height, number of leaves, and chlorophyll content. Next, we conducted comparative proteomics and metabolomics to dissect the complex salt-stress response mechanisms. A total of 314 proteins and 649 metabolites were identified to be differentially behaving upon NaCl treatment. Functional classification and enrichment analysis unravelled that many differential proteins were proteases associated with photosynthesis. Through metabolic pathway enrichment, several energy-related pathways were found to be altered, such as the biosynthesis and degradation of branched-chain amino acids, and our network analysis showed that many ribosomal proteins were involved in these metabolic adaptations. Taken together, for hemp plants, influences on chloroplast function probably represent a major toxic effect of salinity, and modulating several energy-producing pathways possibly through translational regulation is presumably a key protective mechanism against the negative impacts. Our data and analyses provide insights into our understanding of hemp's stress biology and may lay a foundation for future functional genomics studies.\"\n"
