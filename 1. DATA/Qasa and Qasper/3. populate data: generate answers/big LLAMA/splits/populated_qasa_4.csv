How are the results of the input-first and output-first approach different?,"The results of the input-first and output-first approaches are different in terms of the bias towards one label in the generated inputs. The input-first approach can generate inputs biased towards one label, especially for classification tasks, while the output-first approach generates possible class labels and conditions the input generation on each class label, reducing this bias","If by results, you are referring to the outputs of these approaches, then the final output will look very similar - the output for each instance will consist of a tuple of an (input, output) where input and output follow the instructions for a certain task. However, the order in which this output is generated will differ -- for example, in ""input first"" approach, the input is generated first, while in the output first case, the language model is conditioned to provide the required output. On the other hand, if, by results, you are referring to ""performance"" of both of these approaches, the authors mention that the input first approach performs very poorly on classification instances, which is why they proposed the alternative approach of output-first generation for classification tasks.","Because we need two different approaches for classification and non-classification tasks, we next identify whether the generated instruction represents a classification task or not.333More concretely, we regard tasks that have a limited and small output label space as classification tasks.We prompt vanilla GPT3 few-shot to determine this, using 12 classification instructions and 19 non-classification instructions from the seed tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 7. Given the instructions and their task type, we generate instances for each instruction independently. This is challenging because it requires the model to understand what the target task is, based on the instruction, figure out what additional input fields are needed and generate them, and finally complete the task by producing the output. We found that pretrained language models can achieve this to a large extent when prompted with instruction-input-output in-context examples from other tasks.A natural way to do this is the Input-first Approach, where we can ask a language model to come up with the input fields first based on the instruction, and then produce the corresponding output. This generation order is similar to how models are used to respond to instruction and input, but here with in-context examples from other tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 8. However, we found that this approach can generate inputs biased toward one label, especially for classification tasks (e.g., for grammar error detection, it usually generates grammatical input). Therefore, we additionally propose anOutput-first Approach for classification tasks, where we first generate the possible class labels, and then condition the input generation on each class label. The prompting template is shown in Table 9.444In this work, we use a fixed set of seed tasks for prompting the instance generation, and thus only generate a small number of instances per task in one round. Future work can use randomly sampled tasks to prompt the model to generate a larger number of instances in multiple rounds. We apply the output-first approach to the classification tasks identified in the former step, and the input-first approach to the remaining non-classification tasks."
Who were the authors of the instructions?,The authors of the instructions were the authors of the paper,"The authors of the paper created the first set of 175 instructions themselves. After that, they used an iterative bootstrapping process in which they used GPT3 to create more tasks (and instructions). In the end, they ended up with a dataset of 52k instructions.","The instruction data we want to generate contains a set of instructions \{I_{t}\}, each of which defines a task t in natural language. Each task has one or more input-output instances (X_{t},Y_{t}).A model M is expected to produce the output y, given the task instruction I_{t} and the instance input x: M(I_{t},x)=y,\;\mbox{for}\ (x,y)\in(X_{t},Y_{t}).Note that the instruction and instance input does not have a strict boundary in many cases. For example, “write an essay about school safety” can be a valid instruction that we expect models to respond to directly, while it can also be formulated as “write an essay about the following topic” as the instruction, and “school safety” as an instance input. To encourage the diversity of the data format, we allow such instructions that do not require additional input (i.e., x is empty). Self-Instruct is based on a finding that large pretrained language models can be prompted to generate new and novel instructions when presented with some existing instructions in the context. This provides us with a way to grow the instruction data from a small set of seed human-written instructions.We propose to generate a diverse set of instructions in a bootstrapping fashion. We initiate the task pool with 175 tasks (1 instruction and 1 instance for each task) written by our authors. For every step, we sample 8 task instructions from this pool as in-context examples.Of the 8 instructions, 6 are from the human-written tasks,and 2 are from the model-generated tasks in previous steps to promote diversity.The prompting template is shown in Table 6. So far, we have shown the quantity and diversity of the generated data, but its quality remains uncertain. To investigate this, we randomly sample 200 instructions and randomly select 1 instance per instruction. We asked an expert annotator (co-author of this work) to label whether each instance is correct or not, in terms of the instruction, the instance input, and the instance output.Evaluation results in Table 2 show that most of the generated instructions are meaningful, while the generated instances may contain more noise (to a reasonable extent). However, we found that even though the generations may contain errors, most of them are still in the correct format or even partially correct, which can provide useful guidance for training models to follow instructions. We listed a number of good generations and bad generations in Table 10 and Table 11 respectively. In summary, our contributions are: (1) Self-Instruct, a method for inducing instruction-following capabilitywith minimal human-labeled data;(2) We demonstrate its effectiveness via extensive instruction-tuning experiments;(3) We release a large synthetic dataset of 52K instructions and a set of manually-written novel tasks for building and evaluating future instruction-following models."
"How did the authors judge that the generated instructions were ""meaningful""?","The authors judged the generated instructions as ""meaningful"" based on expert annotation, where an expert annotator labeled each instance as correct or not in terms of the instruction, input, and output","The authors judged a generated instruction as meaningful by seeing if it described a valid task. Out of the 200 randomly sampled instructions, they found 92% of them described a valid task.","So far, we have shown the quantity and diversity of the generated data, but its quality remains uncertain. To investigate this, we randomly sample 200 instructions and randomly select 1 instance per instruction.

Why are the gains of instruction-tuning higher for larger models?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Because larger models have more capacity to learn from human annotations, resulting in greater improvements in performance through instruction-tuning","The authors theorize that their approach probably works better for larger models due to it's dependence on language models' inductive biases, but they offer no extra explanation or detail to clarify or explain their stance.","Because of Self-Instruct’s dependence on the inductive biases extracted from LMs, it might work best for larger models.If true, this may create barriers to access for those who may not have large computing resources.We hope future studies will carefully study the gains as a function of model size or various other parameters.It is worthwhile to note that instruction-tuning with human annotation also suffers from a similar limitation: gains of instruction-tuning are higher for larger model Wei et al. (2022)."
How did they finetune GPT3?,"They finetuned GPT3 using the OpenAI finetuning API with default hyperparameters, except for setting the prompt loss weight to 0, and training for 2 epochs","The authors fine-tuned the GPT3 model via an OpenAI API. The model, which is also called ""da vinci"", was dine-tuned by the authors for 2 epochs with a prompt loss weight set to zero.","In this section, we apply our method for inducing instruction data to GPT3 as a case study. We use the largest GPT3 language model (“davinci” engine) accessed through the OpenAI API555https://openai.com/api/. The parameters for making queries are described in Appendix A.1. Here we present an overview of the generated data. With the instruction-generated instruction data, we conduct instruction tuning for the GPT3 model itself (the “davinci” engine). As we described in §3.3, we use various templates to concatenate the instruction and input, and train the model to generate the output. This finetuning is done through the OpenAI finetuning API777https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning. We use the default hyper-parameters, except that we set the prompt loss weight to 0, and we train the model for 2 epochs. We refer the readers to Appendix A.2 for additional finetuning details. The resulting model is denoted as GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}}."
What if one of the generated questions was poor in quality? Wouldn't this result in errors being propagated through the dataset to generate a high number of low quality instructions?,"Yes, it is possible that poor-quality generated questions could result in errors being propagated through the dataset and generating a high number of low-quality instructions","Yes, if one of the generated examples is of poor quality, it is possible that this error could propogate through the dataset leading to a high number of erroneous or low-quality instructions. However, the authors do evaluate and compare the quality of generated samples and find that most samples are of high quality. Even out of those samples that are not fully correct, most of them are atleast partly correct. However, this is a concern with iterative algorithms such as this, a problem probably noted by the authors as an open research question.","Self-Instruct is based on a finding that large pretrained language models can be prompted to generate new and novel instructions when presented with some existing instructions in the context. This provides us with a way to grow the instruction data from a small set of seed human-written instructions.We propose to generate a diverse set of instructions in a bootstrapping fashion.

We listed a number of good generations and bad generations in Table 10 and Table 11 respectively. A point of concern for the authors is the unintended consequences of this iterative algorithm, such as the amplification of problematic social biases (stereotypes or slurs about genders, races, etc.).Relatedly, one observed challenge in this process is the algorithm’s difficulty in producing balanced labels, which reflected models’ prior biases.We hope future work will hash out such details to better understand the pros and cons of the approach."
"Why do the authors claim that human feedback may be less important when their experiments showed that InstructGPT, which had human-generated data, outperformed their model without human-generated data?","The authors claim that human feedback may be less important because their model, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}}, outperformed the original GPT3 model without human-generated data, despite the fact that InstructGPT, which had human-generated data, outperformed GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} on some tasks. The authors suggest that this suggests that the LMs are already familiar with language instructions from their pre-training and that human feedback may not be as crucial for instruction-tuning as previously thought","The authors claim that human feedback might not be essential since their model is able to almost meet the performance of InstructGPT despite not having access to private human-generated training data or manual annotations. They claim that their model's success, of almost reaching InstructGPT performance with only a 5% gap is a strong indication that human data, while useful is not necessarily essential for teaching models how to follow instructions. Additionally, they point out that their work is merely a beginning step in research in this field - while numerous studies have successfully used human annotations to improve performance, studies that attempt to remove the human requirement have not been as explored. Also, the authors do acknowledge that the truth is somewhere in between the two extremes of (1) human instructional data is essential, or (2) such data is largely optional, and similar results can be achieved without it.","To evaluate Self-Instruct empirically, we run this framework on GPT3 Brown et al. (2020), which is a vanilla LM (§4).The iterative Self-Instruct process on this model leads to about 52k instructions, paired with about 82K instance inputs and target outputs.We observe that the resulting data provides a diverse range of creative tasks and over 50% of them have less than 0.3 ROUGE-L overlaps with the seed instructions (§4.2).On this resulting data, we build GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} by fine-tuning GPT3 (i.e., the same model used for generating the instructional data).We evaluate GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} in comparison to various other models on both typical NLP tasks included in Super-NaturalInstructions Wang et al. (2022), and a set of new instructions that are created for novel usage of instruction-following models (§5).The SuperNI results indicate thatGPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} outperforms GPT3 (the original model) by a large margin (+33.1%) and nearly matches the performance of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. Moreover, our human evaluation on the newly-created instruction set shows that GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} demonstrates a broad range of instruction following ability, outperforming models trained on other publicly available instruction datasets and leaving only a 5% gap behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. We evaluate \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{}} Ouyang et al. (2022),which is developed by OpenAI based on GPT3 to follow human instructions better and has been found by the community to have impressive zero-shot abilities.There are various generations of these models,where newer ones use more expansive data or algorithmic novelties101010https://beta.openai.com/docs/model-index-for-researchers.For our SuperNI experiments in §5.3, we only compare with their text-davinci-001 engine, because their newer engines are trained with the latest user data and are likely to already see the SuperNI evaluation set. For our human evaluation of these models on newly written instructions, we include their 001, 002 and 003 engines for completeness. We make the following observations from the results in Table 3.Self-Instructboosts the instruction-following ability of GPT3 by a large margin. The vanilla GPT3 model basically cannot follow human instructions at all. Upon manual analysis, we find that it usually generates irrelevant and repetitive text, and does not know when to stop generation.Compared with other models that are not specifically trained for SuperNI, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} achieves better performance than T0 or the GPT3 finetuned on the T0 training set, which takes tremendous human labeling efforts. Notably, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} also nearly matches the performance of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}, which is trained with private user data and human-annotated labels. Figure 5 provides the performance of GPT3 model and its instruction-tuned counterparts on this newly written instruction set. As anticipated, the vanilla GPT3 language model is largely unable to respond to instructions, and all instruction-tuned models demonstrate comparatively higher performance,Nonetheless, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} (i.e., GPT3 model fine-tuned with Self-Instruct) outperforms those counterparts trained on T0 or SuperNI by a large margin, demonstrating the value of the generated data despite the noise.Compared with \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}} (c.f. footnote 1), GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is quite close in the performance—if we count acceptable response with minor imperfections (Rating-3) as valid, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is only 5% behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. Lastly, our evaluation confirms the impressive instruction-following ability of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{002}} & \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{003}} models. Although there are many factors behind this success, we conjecture that future work can largely benefit from improving the quality of our generated data by using human annotators or training a reward model to select better generations, similar to the algorithm used in Ouyang et al. (2022). A series of works have found evidence that vanilla language models can be effective at following general language instructions if tuned with annotated “instructional” data – datasets containing language instructional commands and their desired outcome based on human judgement Weller et al. (2020); Mishra et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2022); Wei et al. (2022); Sanh et al. (2022); Ouyang et al. (2022); Parmar et al. (2022); Scialom et al. (2022); Chung et al. (2022); Luo et al. (2022); Puri et al. (2022); Yin et al. (2022); Chakrabarty et al. (2022); Lin et al. (2022); Gupta et al. (2022); Muennighoff et al. (2022).Additionally, they show a direct correlation between the size and diversity of the “instructional” data and the generalizability of resulting models to unseen tasks.Since these developments depend on human annotated “instructional” data, this poses a bottleneck for progress toward more generalizable models(for example see Fig. 5a in Wang et al., 2022).Our work aims to tackle this bottleneck by reducing the dependence on human annotators. (H_{1})Human feedback is a necessary and indispensable aspect of instruction-tuning as LMs need to learn about issues that were not quite learned during pre-training.(H_{2})Human feedback is an optional aspect of instruction-tuning as LMs are already quite familiar with instructions from their pre-training. Observing the human feedback is merely a lightweight process for aligning their pre-training distribution/objective which might be replaceable with a different process.While the reality probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes, we conjecturethat it is closer to H_{2}, particularly for larger models.This intuition, that LMs already know much about language instructions, is a key motivation for Self-Instruct and is also supported by its empirical success. We introduce Self-Instruct, a task-agnostic method to improve the instruction-following capabilities of language models via its own generation of instruction data (instruction, input, and output samples) and bootstrapping with it. Our method conducts instruction-tuning of the original model on the pruned subset of generated samples. On experimenting with vanilla GPT3, we observe a 33% absolute improvement over the original model on Super-NaturalInstructions. This performance is on par with \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}, which is trained with private user data and expensive human annotations. Furthermore, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks. Human evaluation on this set shows that tuning GPT3 with Self-Instruct outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5% absolute gap behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. We hope Self-Instruct can serve as the first step to align pretrained language models to follow human instructions, and future work can build on top of this data to improve instruction-following models. Additionally, despite the remarkable performance of models like \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{}} Ouyang et al. (2022), their construction process remains quite opaque.In particular, the role of data has remained understudied due to limited transparency and data released by major corporate entities behind these key models.Addressing such challenges necessitates the creation of a large-scale, public dataset covering a broad range of tasks."
"What is the ""verb-noun structure"" and what does it show?","The ""verb-noun structure"" refers to the combination of a verb and its direct noun object in a sentence, and the analysis of this structure in the generated instructions shows the diversity of intents and textual formats in the dataset","The ""verb-noun structure"" of a sentence is created by identifying the primary verb (action word) in a sentence and identify the corresponding noun that action is being performed on. The authors use this structure to identify what kinds of tasks (i.e. verbs/action words) are used along with specific kinds of nouns.","To study what types of instructions are generated and how diverse they are, we identify the verb-noun structure in the generated instructions. We use the Berkeley Neural Parser666https://parser.kitaev.io/ (Kitaev and Klein, 2018; Kitaev et al., 2019) to parse the instructions, and then extract the verb that is closest to the root of the parse tree as well as its first direct noun object. 26,559 out of the 52,445 instructions contain such structure; other instructions usually contain more complex clauses (e.g., “Classify whether this tweet contains political content or not.”) or are framed as questions (e.g., “Which of these statements are true?”).We plot the top 20 most common root verbs and their top 4direct noun objects in Figure 4, which accounts for 14% of the entire set. Overall, we see quite diverse intents and textual formats in these instructions."
What is the motivation behind learning disentangled representations of data ?,"To achieve interpretability, particularly decomposability of latent representations, allowing for intuitive explanations",The motivation behind learning disentangled representations of data is a desire to achieve interpretability particularly the decomposability of latent representations to admit intuitive explanations. Another motivation of learning disentangled representations is to generalize framework of decomposition.,"An oft-stated motivation for learning disentangled representations of data with deep generative models is a desire to achieve interpretability [5, 10]—particularly the decomposability [see §3.2.1 in 33] of latent representations to admit intuitive explanations.Most work has focused on capturing purely independent factors of variation [10, 7, 16, 25, 4, 57, 3, 8, 17, 15, 59], typically evaluating this using purpose-built, synthetic data [15, 17, 25], whose generative factors are independent by construction. In this work, we explored and analysed the fundamental characteristics of learning disentangled representations, and showed how these can be generalised to a more general framework of decomposition [33].We characterised the learning of decomposed latent representation with vaes in terms of the control of two factors:i) overlap in the latent space between encodings of different datapoints, andii) regularisation of the aggregate encoding distribution to the given prior, which encodes the structure one would wish for the latent space to have."
What is the aim of using VAEs ?,"To achieve disentanglement in the latent representations of data, by fulfilling two factors: appropriate level of overlap in the latent space and conformity to a desired structure represented through the prior",The aim to use VAEs is to explore their decomposition capability to fulfill latent encoding of overlapping data and aggregate encoding of this data conforming to desired structure. The approaches that explore disentanglement in the context of  VAEs aims to achieve independence between the dimensions of the aggregate encoding.,"Of particular relevance to this work are approaches that explore disentanglement in the context of vaes [17, 3, 51, 25, 8, 16].Here one aims to achieve independence between the dimensions of the aggregate encoding, typically defined asq_{\phi}(\bm{z})\triangleq\operatorname{{}\mathbb{E}}_{p_{\mathcal{D}}(\bm{x})}\left[q(\bm{z}|\bm{x})\right]\approx\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n}q(\bm{z}|\bm{x}_{i}).The significance of q_{\phi}(\bm{z}) is that it is the marginal distribution induced on the latents by sampling a datapoint and then using the encoder to sample an encoding given that datapoint. It can thus informally be thought of as the pushforward distribution for “sampling” representations in the latent space. We characterise the decomposition of latent spaces in vaes to be the fulfilment of two factors (as shown in Figure 1):a.An “appropriate” level of overlap in the latent space—ensuring that the range of latent values capable of encoding a particular datapoint is neither too small, nor too large.This is, in general, dictated by the level of stochasticity in the encoder: the noisier the encoding process is, the higher the number of datapoints which can plausibly give rise to a particular encoding.b.The aggregate encoding q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) matching the prior p\left(\bm{z}\right), where the latter expresses the desired dependency structure between latents. We posit a generalisation of disentanglement in vaes—decomposing their latent representations—that can help avoid such pitfalls.We characterise decomposition in vaes as the fulfilment of two factors:a) the latent encodings of data having an appropriate level of overlap, andb) the aggregate encoding of data conforming to a desired structure, represented through the prior.We emphasize that neither of these factors is sufficient in isolation: withoutan appropriate level of overlap, encodings can degrade to a lookup tablewhere the latents convey little information about data, and without the aggregate encoding of data following a desired structure, the encodings do not decompose as desired."
How is a VAE different from an autoencoder ?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

A VAE is different from an autoencoder in that it has a probabilistic generative model, allowing it to learn a continuous and structured representation of the data, whereas an autoencoder only learns a reconstruction of the input data",[ Disentanglement is independence of feature and it is used in traditional auto encoders whereas it is not used in VAEs],"[“ Disentanglement, as typically employed in literature, refers"
What is Disentanglement ?,"A more general framework for capturing alternate notions of decomposition in learned representations, beyond the traditional independence-based definition typically employed in VAEs and other deep learning approaches","Disentanglement refers to independence among features in a representation. The idea stems back to traditional methods such as ICA and conventional autoencoders. Disentanglement implicitly makes a choice of decomposition: that the latent features are independent of one another. Much of the prior work in the field has either implicitly or explicitly presumed a slightly more ambitious definition of disentanglement than considered above: that it is a measure of how well one captures true factors of variation (which happen to be independent by construction for synthetic data), rather than just independent factors. The commonly assumed notion of disentanglement is quite restrictive for complex models where the true generative factors are not independent, very large in number, or where it cannot be reasonably assumed that there is a well-defined set of “true” generative factors.","Much of the prior work in the field has either implicitly or explicitly presumed a slightly more ambitious definition of disentanglement than considered above: that it is a measure of how well one captures true factors of variation (which happen to be independent by construction for synthetic data), rather than just independent factors.After all, if we wish for our learned representations to be interpretable, it is necessary for the latent variables to take on clear-cut meaning. The commonly assumed notion of disentanglement is quite restrictive for complex models where the true generative factors are not independent, very large in number, or where it cannot be reasonably assumed that there is a well-defined set of “true” generative factors (as will be the case for many, if not most, real datasets).To this end, we introduce a generalization of disentanglement, decomposition, which at a high-level can be thought of as imposing a desired structure on the learned representations.This permits disentanglement as a special case, for which the desired structure is that q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) factors along its dimensions. Disentanglement implicitly makes a choice of decomposition: that the latent features are independent of one another.We make this explicit and exploit it to both provide improvement to disentanglement through judicious choices of structure in the prior, and to introduce a more general framework flexible enough to capture alternate, more complex, notions of decomposition such as sparsity, clustering, hierarchical structuring, or independent subspaces. Disentanglement, as typically employed in literature, refers to independence among features in a representation [5, 15, 18].Conceptually, however, it has a long history, far longer than we could reasonably do justice here, and is far from specific to vaes.The idea stems back to traditional methods such as ICA [58, 23] and conventional autoencoders [50], through to a range of modern approaches employing deep learning [47, 36, 9, 37, 1, 19, 11]."
Why was decomposition introduced ?,"To generalize disentanglement and avoid pitfalls in VAEs, such as degenerate latent representations","Decomposition can be thought of as imposing a desired structure on the learned representations at a high level.

What are the factors of fullfilement for the decomposition of latent spaces in VAEs ?,"The two factors of fulfillment for the decomposition of latent spaces in VAEs are:

What is the effect of having larger values of β ?,"Larger values of β can lead to an increase in the level of overlap between the latent dimensions, but can also cause the encodings to collapse to a mode and result in a mismatch between the approximate posterior and the prior","Large \beta is not universally beneficial for disentanglement, as the level of overlap can be increased too far. Increasing \beta can reinforce existing inductive biases, wherein mean-field assumptions encourage representations which reduce dependence between the latent dimensions.

When \beta is too large, the encoding of a datapoint loses meaning. overly large values of \beta actually cause a mismatch between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right) (see top right of Figure 3).","Taken together, this implies that the \beta-vae’s ability to encourage disentanglement is predominantly through direct control over the level of overlap.It places no other direct constraint on the latents to disentangle (although in some cases, the annealed prior may inadvertently encourage better disentanglement), but instead helps avoid the pitfalls of inappropriate overlap.Amongst other things, this explains why large \beta is not universally beneficial for disentanglement, as the level of overlap can be increased too far. It should be noted, however, that the value of \beta can indirectly influence the level of disentanglement when using a mean-field assumption for the encoder distribution (i.e. restricting S_{\phi}(x) to be diagonal).As noted by Stühmer et al. [52], Rolinek et al. [49], increasing \beta can reinforce existing inductive biases, wherein mean-field assumptions encourage representations which reduce dependence between the latent dimensions [55]. We see in Figure 3 that increasing \beta increases the level of overlap in q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right), as a consequence of increasing the encoder variance for individual datapoints.When \beta is too large, the encoding of a datapoint loses meaning.Also, as a single datapoint encodes to a Gaussian distribution, q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) is unable to match p\left(\bm{z}\right) exactly.Because q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right)\rightarrow q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) when \beta\rightarrow\infty, this in turn means thatoverly large values of \beta actually cause a mismatch between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right) (see top right of Figure 3).Increasing \alpha, instead always improved the match between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right).Here, the finiteness of the dataset and the choice of divergence results in an increase in overlap with increasing \alpha, but only up to the level required for a non-negligible overlap between the nearby datapoints: large values of \alpha did not cause the encodings to collapse to a mode."
Does β-VAE's objective control overlap ?,"Yes, the β-VAE's objective controls overlap","The \beta-vae objective to show that its contribution to disentangling is primarily through direct control of the level of overlap between encodings of the data, expressed by maximising the entropy of the encoding distribution. \beta-vae’s ability to encourage disentanglement is predominantly through direct control over the level of overlap. Hence, β-VAE's objective control overlap.","Taken together, this implies that the \beta-vae’s ability to encourage disentanglement is predominantly through direct control over the level of overlap.It places no other direct constraint on the latents to disentangle (although in some cases, the annealed prior may inadvertently encourage better disentanglement), but instead helps avoid the pitfalls of inappropriate overlap.Amongst other things, this explains why large \beta is not universally beneficial for disentanglement, as the level of overlap can be increased too far. This shows that the \beta-vae objective does not directly encourage latent variables to take on meaningful representations when using the standard choice of an isotropic Gaussian prior.In fact, on its own, it encourages latent representations which match the true generative factors no more than it encourages any arbitrary rotation of these factors, with such rotations capable of exhibiting strong correlations between latents.This view is further supported by our empirical results (see Figure 2), where we did not observe any gains in disentanglement (using the metric from Kim and Mnih [25]) from increasing \beta>0 with an isotropic Gaussian prior trained on the 2D Shapes dataset [38].It may also go some way to explaining the extremely high levels of variation we found in the disentanglement-metric scores between different random seeds at train time. Given the characterisation set out above, we now develop an objective that incorporates the effect of both factors (a) and (b).Our analysis of the \beta-vae tells us that its objective allows direct control over the level of overlap, i.e. factor Item a.To incorporate direct control over the regularisation Item b between the marginal posterior and the prior, we add a divergence term \mathbb{D}(q_{{\phi}}\left(z\right),p(\bm{z})), yielding\displaystyle\begin{split}\mathcal{L}_{\alpha,\beta}&(\bm{x})=\operatorname{{}\mathbb{E}}_{q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\mid\bm{x}\right)}\left[\log p_{{\theta}}\left(\bm{x}\mid\bm{z}\right)\right]\\&-\beta~{}\operatorname{\scalebox{0.95}{\text{KL}}}\left(q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\mid\bm{x}\right)\,\|\;p(\bm{z})\right)-\alpha~{}\mathbb{D}(q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right),p(\bm{z}))\end{split}(7)allowing control over how much factors (a) and (b) are enforced, through appropriate setting of \beta and \alpha respectively. Connecting prior work on disentanglement to this framework, we analysed the \beta-vae objective to show that its contribution to disentangling is primarily through direct control of the level of overlap between encodings of the data, expressed by maximising the entropy of the encoding distribution.In the commonly encountered case of assuming an isotropic Gaussian prior and an independent Gaussian posterior, we showed that control of overlap is the only effect of the \beta-vae.Motivated by this observation, we developed an alternate objective for the elbo that allows control of the two factors of decomposability through an additional regularisation term.We then conducted empirical evaluations using this objective, targeting alternate forms of decompositions such as clustering and sparsity, and observed the effect of varying the extent of regularisation to the prior on the quality of the resulting clustering and sparseness of the learnt embeddings.The results indicate that we were successful in attaining those decompositions. To connect our framework with existing approaches for encouraging disentanglement, we provide a theoretical analysis of the \beta-vae [17, 3, 2], and show that it typically only allows control of latent overlap, the first decomposition factor.We show that it can be interpreted, up to a constant offset, as the standard vae objective with its prior annealed as p_{{\theta}}\left(\bm{z}\right)^{\beta} and an additional maximum entropy regularization of the encoder that increases the stochasticity of the encodings.Specialising this result for the typical choice of a Gaussian encoder and isotropic Gaussian prior indicates that the \beta-vae, up to a scaling of the latent space, is equivalent to the vae plus a regulariser encouraging higher encoder variance.Moreover, this objective is invariant to rotations of the learned latent representation, meaning that it does not, on its own, encourage the latent variables to take on meaningful representations any more than an arbitrary rotation of them."
What is the purpose of using a non-isotropic Gaussian prior in the VAE model?,To improve disentanglement scores by incorporating more structured information into the prior distribution,"the purpose of using a non-isotropic Gaussian prior in the VAE model is to get better disentanglement scores, with further improvement achieved when the prior variance is learnt","Figure 2 demonstrates that notable improvements in disentanglement can be achieved by using non-isotropic priors:for a given reconstruction loss, implicitly fixed by \beta, non-isotropic Gaussian priors got better disentanglement scores, with further improvement achieved when the prior variance is learnt.With a product of Student-t priors p_{\nu}(\bm{z}) (noting p_{\nu}(\bm{z})\rightarrow\mathcal{N}(\bm{z};\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}) as \nu\rightarrow\infty), reducing \nu only incurred a minor reconstruction penalty, for improved disentanglement.Interestingly,very low values of \nu caused the disentanglement score to drop again (though still giving higher values than the Gaussian).We speculate that this may be related to the effect of heavy tails on the disentanglement metric itself, rather than being an objectively worse disentanglement.Another interesting result was that for an isotropic Gaussian prior, as per the original \beta-vae setup, no gains at all were achieved in disentanglement by increasing \beta."
How controlling the variance specifically affects the level of overlap?,"Controlling the variance of the encoder distribution q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) allows for a more precise control over the level of overlap between the encoded datapoints, as increasing the variance increases the range of possible encodings and can lead to a better match between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right)",Controlling the variance is effective means of achieving the desired overlap behaviour. Increasing variance increases level of overlap.,"We see in Figure 3 that increasing \beta increases the level of overlap in q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right), as a consequence of increasing the encoder variance for individual datapoints.When \beta is too large, the encoding of a datapoint loses meaning.Also, as a single datapoint encodes to a Gaussian distribution, q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) is unable to match p\left(\bm{z}\right) exactly.Because q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right)\rightarrow q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) when \beta\rightarrow\infty, this in turn means thatoverly large values of \beta actually cause a mismatch between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right) (see top right of Figure 3).Increasing \alpha, instead always improved the match between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right).Here, the finiteness of the dataset and the choice of divergence results in an increase in overlap with increasing \alpha, but only up to the level required for a non-negligible overlap between the nearby datapoints: large values of \alpha did not cause the encodings to collapse to a mode. However, when the encoder is unimodal with fixed form (in particularly the tail behaviour is fixed) and the prior is well-characterised by Euclidean distances, then these factors have a substantially reduced ability to vary for a given I(\bm{x};\bm{z}), which subsequently becomes a good characterisation of the level of overlap.When q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) is Gaussian, controlling the variance of q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) (with a fixed q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right)) should similarly provide an effective means of achieving the desired overlap behaviour.As this is the most common use case, we leave the development of more a general definition of overlap to future work, simply noting that this is an important consideration when using flexible encoder distributions."
How does the form of the encoding distribution affect the ability to uncover true generative factors in VAEs?,"The form of the encoding distribution can affect the ability to uncover true generative factors in VAEs by allowing the model to prioritize certain dimensions with higher variance, which may correspond to more important factors in the generative process","The exact form of the encoding distribution affect the ability to uncover true generative factors in VAEs. If we restrict the encoder variance to be isotropic and then use a two dimensional prior where one latent dimension has a much larger variance than the other.It will be possible to store more information in the prior dimension with higher variance. Consequently, that dimension is more likely to correspond to an important factor of the generative process than the other. However it cannot be concluded that form of encoding is a true factor of variation in generative process and choosing encoding distribution arbitrarily is a good choice.","The exact form of the encoding distribution is also important here.For example, imagine we restrict the encoder variance to be isotropic and then use a two dimensional prior where one latent dimension has a much larger variance than the other.It will be possible to store more information in the prior dimension with higher variance (as we can spread points out more relative to the encoder variance).Consequently, that dimension is more likely to correspond to an important factor of the generative process than the other.Of course, this does not imply that this is a true factor of variation in the generative process, but neither is the meaning that can be attributed to each dimension completely arbitrary."
What is the role of encoding noise and the likelihood distribution in VAE representations?,"Encoding noise and the likelihood distribution play a crucial role in shaping the representations learned by VAEs. The stochastic nature of the encodings during training forces nearby encodings to relate to similar data points, while the likelihood distribution ensures that information is stored in the encodings, not just in the generative network. This leads to the preference for smooth representations and the ability to learn meaningful features despite the limitations of the generative model","In VAE representation, the encoding noise forces nearby encodings to relate to similar datapoints, while standard choices for the likelihood distribution ensure that information is stored in the encodings, not just in the generative network","In concurrently published work, Locatello et al. [34] question the plausibility of learning unsupervised disentangled representations with meaningful features, based on theoretical analyses showing an equivalence class of generative models, many members of which could be entangled.Though their analysis is sound, we posit a counterargument to their conclusions, based on the stochastic nature of the encodings used during training.Namely, that this stochasticity means that they need not give rise to the same elbo scores (an important exception is the rotational invariance for isotropic Gaussian priors).Essentially, the encoding noise forces nearby encodings to relate to similar datapoints, while standard choices for the likelihood distribution (e.g. assuming conditional independence) ensure that information is stored in the encodings, not just in the generative network.These restrictions mean that the elbo prefers smooth representations and, provided the prior is not rotationally invariant, means that there no longer need be a class of different representations with the same elbo; simpler representations are preferred to more complex ones."

"What are identity shortcuts and projection shortcuts, and how are they used in the experiments?","Identity shortcuts are shortcuts that use the original input dimensions without any transformation or projection, while projection shortcuts are shortcuts that use a projection operation to reduce the dimensionality of the input. In the experiments, identity shortcuts are used to preserve the original input dimensions and prevent residual learning, while projection shortcuts are used to reduce the dimensionality of the input and introduce extra parameters to improve performance","The identity and projection shortcut are not defined in this section. Identity shortcuts help in training, do not increase the complexity of the bottleneck architectures and solve degradation problem. projection shortcuts are not essential for addressing the degradation problem so these are not considered. Projection shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions","Identity vs. Projection Shortcuts.We have shown that parameter-free, identity shortcuts help with training. Next we investigate projection shortcuts (Eqn.(2)).In Table 3 we compare three options: (A) zero-padding shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions, and all shortcuts are parameter-free (the same as Table 2 and Fig. 4 right); (B) projection shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions, and other shortcuts are identity; and (C) all shortcuts are projections. Table 3 shows that all three options are considerably better than the plain counterpart.B is slightly better than A. We argue that this is because the zero-padded dimensions in A indeed have no residual learning. C is marginally better than B, and we attribute this to the extra parameters introduced by many (thirteen) projection shortcuts. But the small differences among A/B/C indicate that projection shortcuts are not essential for addressing the degradation problem. So we do not use option C in the rest of this paper, to reduce memory/time complexity and model sizes. Identity shortcuts are particularly important for not increasing the complexity of the bottleneck architectures that are introduced below."

The original mapping is recast into \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x})+\mathbf{x}.We hypothesize that it is easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the original, unreferenced mapping.

"How does the use of shortcut connections in this paper compare to previous practices and theories, such as those used in MLPs and highway networks?","The use of shortcut connections in this paper differs from previous practices and theories in several ways. Unlike MLPs, which add a linear layer connected from the network input to the output, or highway networks with gating functions, our identity shortcuts are parameter-free and always pass information through.

All information is always passed through additional residual functions to be learned. It also demonstrate the accuracy gain with increased depths unlike highway network. The highway network uses shortcut connections with gating functions which are data dependent and have parameters. It uses non-residual functions when identity shortcut is closed. MLP uses shortcut connections with an additional linear layer from input to output for training. It does not uses residual functions,"Shortcut Connections.Practices and theories that lead to shortcut connections [2, 34, 49] have been studied for a long time.An early practice of training multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) is to add a linear layer connected from the network input to the output [34, 49]. In [44, 24], a few intermediate layers are directly connected to auxiliary classifiers for addressing vanishing/exploding gradients. The papers of [39, 38, 31, 47] propose methods for centering layer responses, gradients, and propagated errors, implemented by shortcut connections. In [44], an “inception” layer is composed of a shortcut branch and a few deeper branches. Concurrent with our work, “highway networks” [42, 43] present shortcut connections with gating functions [15]. These gates are data-dependent and have parameters, in contrast to our identity shortcuts that are parameter-free. When a gated shortcut is “closed” (approaching zero), the layers in highway networks represent non-residual functions. On the contrary, our formulation always learns residual functions; our identity shortcuts are never closed, and all information is always passed through, with additional residual functions to be learned. In addition, highway networks have not demonstrated accuracy gains with extremely increased depth (e.g., over 100 layers)."

What are the different approaches that have been used in face recognition technology over the years?,"Over the years, various approaches have been used in face recognition technology, including:

1. Holistic approaches, which derive a low-dimensional representation of the face through certain distribution assumptions, such as linear subspace, manifold, and sparse representation.
2. Local-feature-based approaches, which use local filters to extract invariant features and achieve robust performance.
3. Learning-based local descriptors, which learn local filters and encoding codes to improve distinctiveness and compactness.
4. Deep learning-based approaches, which have dramatically boosted accuracy in recent years, using techniques such as autoencoders, 3D models, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)","Starting from the 1990s to the 2000s, holistic approaches were the most prominent direction in face recognition, Later on, local-feature-based face recognition was introduced. In the 2010s, shallow learning-based-local-descriptors were used. In 2014, the DeepFace, a deep learning-based model, was invented. And ever since, the state-of-the-art techniques were from deep learning-based approaches.","Face recognition (FR) has been the prominent biometric technique for identity authentication and has been widely used in many areas, such as military, finance, public security and daily life. FR has been a long-standing research topic in the CVPR community. In the early 1990s, the study of FR became popular following the introduction of the historical Eigenface approach [1]. The milestones of feature-based FR over the past years are presented in Fig. 1, in which the times of four major technical streams are highlighted. The holistic approaches derive the low-dimensional representation through certain distribution assumptions, such as linear subspace [2][3][4], manifold [5][6][7], and sparse representation [8][9][10][11]. This idea dominated the FR community in the 1990s and 2000s. However, a well-known problem is that these theoretically plausible holistic methods fail to address the uncontrolled facial changes that deviate from their prior assumptions. In the early 2000s, this problem gave rise to local-feature-based FR. Gabor [12] and LBP [13], as well as their multilevel and high-dimensional extensions [14][15][16], achieved robust performance through some invariant properties of local filtering. Unfortunately, handcrafted features suffered from a lack of distinctiveness and compactness. In the early 2010s, learning-based local descriptors were introduced to the FR community [17][18][19], in which local filters are learned for better distinctiveness and the encoding codebook is learned for better compactness. However, these shallow representations still have an inevitable limitation on robustness against the complex nonlinear facial appearance variations. In general, traditional methods attempted to recognize human face by one or two layer representations, such as filtering responses, histogram of the feature codes, or distribution of the dictionary atoms. The research community studied intensively to separately improve the preprocessing, local descriptors, and feature transformation, but these approaches improved FR accuracy slowly. What’s worse, most methods aimed to address one aspect of unconstrained facial changes only, such as lighting, pose, expression, or disguise. There was no any integrated technique to address these unconstrained challenges integrally. As a result, with continuous efforts of more than a decade, “shallow” methods only improved the accuracy of the LFW benchmark to about 95% [15], which indicates that “shallow” methods are insufficient to extract stable identity feature invariant to real-world changes. Due to the insufficiency of this technical, facial recognition systems were often reported with unstable performance or failures with countless false alarms in real-world applications. In 2014, DeepFace [20] achieved the SOTA accuracy on the famous LFW benchmark [23], approaching human performance on the unconstrained condition for the first time (DeepFace: 97.35% vs. Human: 97.53%), by training a 9-layer model on 4 million facial images. Inspired by this work, research focus has shifted to deep-learning-based approaches, and the accuracy was dramatically boosted to above 99.80% in just three years. Deep learning technique has reshaped the research landscape of FR in almost all aspects such as algorithm designs, training/test datasets, application scenarios and even the evaluation protocols. Therefore, it is of great significance to review the breakthrough and rapid development process in recent years. There have been several surveys on FR [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and its subdomains, and they mostly summarized and compared a diverse set of techniques related to a specific FR scene, such as illumination-invariant FR [29], 3D FR [28], pose-invariant FR [30][31]. Unfortunately, due to their earlier publication dates, none of them covered the deep learning methodology that is most successful nowadays. This survey focuses only on recognition problem, and one can refer to Ranjan et al. [32] for a brief review of a full deep FR pipeline with detection and alignment, or refer to Jin et al. [33] for a survey of face alignment. Specifically, the major contributions of this survey are as follows: We present the development of face processing methods in chronological order in Fig. 12. As we can see from the figure, most papers attempted to perform face processing by autoencoder model in 2014 and 2015; while 3D model played an important role in 2016. GAN [40] has drawn substantial attention from the deep learning and computer vision community since it was first proposed by Goodfellow et al. It can be used in different fields and was also introduced into face processing in 2017. GAN can be used to perform “one-to-many augmentation” and “many-to-one normalization”, and it broke the limit that face synthesis should be done under supervised way. Although GAN has not been widely used in face processing for training and recognition, it has great latent capacity for preprocessing, for example, Dual-Agent GANs (DA-GAN) [56] won the 1st places on verification and identification tracks in the NIST IJB-A 2017 FR competitions."
How has deep learning improved the accuracy of face recognition systems compared to traditional methods?,"Deep learning has significantly improved the accuracy of face recognition systems compared to traditional methods, with the accuracy boosted from around 95% to above 99.8% in just three years","The traditional methods (i.e holistic approaches, local-feature-based methods, shallow learning) were the approaches used before the boom of deep learning based techniques. They could achieve an accuracy of 95%, while the human accuracy was 97.53%. The rapid progress of deep learning methods quickly equaled human performance (DeepFace 97.35%) and later on surpassed them with 99.8%. These methods could achieve such numbers by using bigger and bigger datasets and new architectures.","In general, traditional methods attempted to recognize human face by one or two layer representations, such as filtering responses, histogram of the feature codes, or distribution of the dictionary atoms. The research community studied intensively to separately improve the preprocessing, local descriptors, and feature transformation, but these approaches improved FR accuracy slowly. What’s worse, most methods aimed to address one aspect of unconstrained facial changes only, such as lighting, pose, expression, or disguise. There was no any integrated technique to address these unconstrained challenges integrally. As a result, with continuous efforts of more than a decade, “shallow” methods only improved the accuracy of the LFW benchmark to about 95% [15], which indicates that “shallow” methods are insufficient to extract stable identity feature invariant to real-world changes. Due to the insufficiency of this technical, facial recognition systems were often reported with unstable performance or failures with countless false alarms in real-world applications. With the evolved architectures and advanced training techniques, such as batch normalization (BN), the network becomes deeper and the training becomes more controllable. Following these architectures in object classification, the networks in deep FR are also developed step by step, and the performance of deep FR is continually improving. We present these mainstream architectures of deep FR in Fig. 9. In 2014, DeepFace [20] was the first to use a nine-layer CNN with several locally connected layers. With 3D alignment for face processing, it reaches an accuracy of 97.35% on LFW. In 2015, FaceNet [38] used a large private dataset to train a GoogleNet. It adopted a triplet loss function based on triplets of roughly aligned matching/nonmatching face patches generated by a novel online triplet mining method and achieved good performance of 99.63%. In the same year, VGGface [37] designed a procedure to collect a large-scale dataset from the Internet. It trained the VGGNet on this dataset and then fine-tuned the networks via a triplet loss function similar to FaceNet. VGGface obtains an accuracy of 98.95%. In 2017, SphereFace [84] used a 64-layer ResNet architecture and proposed the angular softmax (A-Softmax) loss to learn discriminative face features with angular margin. It boosts the achieves to 99.42% on LFW. In the end of 2017, a new large-scale face dataset, namely VGGface2 [39], was introduced, which consists of large variations in pose, age, illumination, ethnicity and profession. Cao et al. first trained a SENet with MS-celeb-1M dataset [45] and then fine-tuned the model with VGGface2 [39], and achieved the SOTA performance on the IJB-A [41] and IJB-B [42]. In 2014, DeepFace [20] achieved the SOTA accuracy on the famous LFW benchmark [23], approaching human performance on the unconstrained condition for the first time (DeepFace: 97.35% vs. Human: 97.53%), by training a 9-layer model on 4 million facial images. Inspired by this work, research focus has shifted to deep-learning-based approaches, and the accuracy was dramatically boosted to above 99.80% in just three years. Deep learning technique has reshaped the research landscape of FR in almost all aspects such as algorithm designs, training/test datasets, application scenarios and even the evaluation protocols.

In what areas has face recognition technology been commonly used?,"Military, finance, public security, and daily life","Face recognition is widely used in the military, finance, public security, and daily life.","Face recognition (FR) has been the prominent biometric technique for identity authentication and has been widely used in many areas, such as military, finance, public security and daily life. FR has been a long-standing research topic in the CVPR community. In the early 1990s, the study of FR became popular following the introduction of the historical Eigenface approach [1]. The milestones of feature-based FR over the past years are presented in Fig. 1, in which the times of four major technical streams are highlighted. The holistic approaches derive the low-dimensional representation through certain distribution assumptions, such as linear subspace [2][3][4], manifold [5][6][7], and sparse representation [8][9][10][11]. This idea dominated the FR community in the 1990s and 2000s. However, a well-known problem is that these theoretically plausible holistic methods fail to address the uncontrolled facial changes that deviate from their prior assumptions. In the early 2000s, this problem gave rise to local-feature-based FR. Gabor [12] and LBP [13], as well as their multilevel and high-dimensional extensions [14][15][16], achieved robust performance through some invariant properties of local filtering. Unfortunately, handcrafted features suffered from a lack of distinctiveness and compactness. In the early 2010s, learning-based local descriptors were introduced to the FR community [17][18][19], in which local filters are learned for better distinctiveness and the encoding codebook is learned for better compactness. However, these shallow representations still have an inevitable limitation on robustness against the complex nonlinear facial appearance variations. •Ubiquitous face recognition across applications and scenes. Deep face recognition has been successfully applied on many user-cooperated applications, but the ubiquitous recognition applications in everywhere are still an ambitious goal. In practice, it is difficult to collect and label sufficient samples for innumerable scenes in real world. One promising solution is to first learn a general model and then transfer it to an application-specific scene. While deep domain adaptation [145] has recently been applied to reduce the algorithm bias on different scenes [148], different races [173], general solution to transfer face recognition is largely open."
What are the three main modules of a face recognition system?,"1. Face detector
2. Facial landmark detector
3. Face matching module","The 3 main modules are: face detection, facial landmark detector, and FR module.","Before a face image is fed to an FR module, face anti-spoofing, which recognizes whether the face is live or spoofed, is applied to avoid different types of attacks. Then, recognition can be performed. As shown in Fig. 3(c), an FR module consists of face processing, deep feature extraction and face matching, and it can be described as follows: As mentioned in [32], there are three modules needed for FR system, as shown in Fig. 3. First, a face detector is used to localize faces in images or videos. Second, with the facial landmark detector, the faces are aligned to normalized canonical coordinates. Third, the FR module is implemented with these aligned face images. We only focus on the FR module throughout the remainder of this paper."
How is deep learning used in the process of feature extraction in face recognition systems?,"Deep learning is used in the process of feature extraction in face recognition systems through the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction, from simple features such as Gabor and SIFT to more complex features that can recognize facial attributes like smile and blue eyes",The deep learning model does feature extraction by processing the image through many layers and giving an encoding of the face that can be used to solve different FR tasks. The early layers of a deep learning model tend to represent simple textures that continuously evolve into facial structures in the later layers.,"For most applications, it is difficult to include the candidate faces during the training stage, which makes FR become a “zero-shot” learning task. Fortunately, since all human faces share a similar shape and texture, the representation learned from a small proportion of faces can generalize well to the rest. Based on this theory, a straightforward way to improve generalized performance is to include as many IDs as possible in the training set. For example, Internet giants such as Facebook and Google have reported their deep FR system trained by 10^{6}-10^{7} IDs [38, 20]. But all that changed in 2012 when AlexNet won the ImageNet competition by a large margin using a technique called deep learning [22]. Deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks, use a cascade of multiple layers of processing units for feature extraction and transformation. They learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction. The levels form a hierarchy of concepts, showing strong invariance to the face pose, lighting, and expression changes, as shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen from the figure that the first layer of the deep neural network is somewhat similar to the Gabor feature found by human scientists with years of experience. The second layer learns more complex texture features. The features of the third layer are more complex, and some simple structures have begun to appear, such as high-bridged nose and big eyes. In the fourth, the network output is enough to explain a certain facial attribute, which can make a special response to some clear abstract concepts such as smile, roar, and even blue eye. In conclusion, in deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), the lower layers automatically learn the features similar to Gabor and SIFT designed for years or even decades (such as initial layers in Fig. 2), and the higher layers further learn higher level abstraction. Finally, the combination of these higher level abstraction represents facial identity with unprecedented stability. 3D FR has inherent advantages over 2D methods, but 3D deep FR is not well developed due to the lack of large annotated 3D data. To enlarge 3D training datasets, most works use the methods of “one-to-many augmentation” to synthesize 3D faces. However, the effective methods for extracting deep features of 3D faces remain to be explored. Kim et al. [204] fine-tuned a 2D CNN with a small amount of 3D scans for 3D FR. Zulqarnain et al. [259] used a three-channel (corresponding to depth, azimuth and elevation angles of the normal vector) image as input and minimized the average prediction log-loss. Zhang et al. [260] first selected 30 feature points from the Candide-3 face model to characterize faces, then conducted the unsupervised pretraining of face depth data, and finally performed the supervised fine-tuning."
What are some challenges that researchers have encountered when generating 3D face images from 2D images?,"Large annotated 3D data is lacking, and effective methods for extracting deep features of 3D faces remain to be explored","The paper mainly talks about research on 3D face data reconstruction in terms of ""one-to-many augmentation"" methods. Also, attempts to enlarge 3D face datasets with the same method are mentioned. However, no challenges or specific issues during the process of 3D face reconstruction are included in the paper.","3D model. 3D face reconstruction is also a way to enrich the diversity of training data. They utilize 3D structure information to model the transformation between poses. 3D models first use 3D face data to obtain morphable displacement fields and then apply them to obtain 2D face data in different pose angles. There is a large number of papers about this domain, but we only focus on the 3D face reconstruction using deep methods or used for deep FR. In [47], Masi et al. generated face images with new intra-class facial appearance variations, including pose, shape and expression, and then trained a 19-layer VGGNet with both real and augmented data. Masi et al. [48] used generic 3D faces and rendered fixed views to reduce much of the computational effort. Richardson et al. [49] employed an iterative 3D CNN by using a secondary input channel to represent the previous network’s output as an image for reconstructing a 3D face as shown in Fig. 13. Dou et al. [51] used a multi-task CNN to divide 3D face reconstruction into neutral 3D reconstruction and expressive 3D reconstruction. Tran et al. [53] directly regressed 3D morphable face model (3DMM) [155] parameters from an input photo by a very deep CNN architecture. An et al. [156] synthesized face images with various poses and expressions using the 3DMM method, then reduced the gap between synthesized data and real data with the help of MMD. 3D FR has inherent advantages over 2D methods, but 3D deep FR is not well developed due to the lack of large annotated 3D data.

"How has the quality and diversity of generated 3D face images improved over time, and what advances have contributed to these improvements?","The quality and diversity of generated 3D face images have improved significantly over time, primarily due to advances in deep learning methods and the use of 3D face reconstruction techniques. These advances have enabled the generation of more realistic and diverse 3D face images, including those with new intra-class facial appearance variations, such as pose, shape, and expression","The paper only talks about the line of work on 3D image reconstruction, in other words, the methods and approaches to reconstruct 3D face images.

"What are the main differences between the large-scale training datasets MS-Celeb-1M, VGGface2, and Megaface in terms of depth versus breadth, long tail distribution, and data engineering practices?	","MS-Celeb-1M and VGGface2 differ in depth vs. breadth, long tail distribution, and data engineering practices. MS-Celeb-1M has breadth with many subjects but limited images per subject, while VGGface2 has depth with limited subjects but many images per subject. Megaface utilizes the whole distribution, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 2469 images per person. Long tail distribution is used differently among datasets, with MS-Celeb-1M's novel set studying low-shot learning, and Megaface using the whole distribution to contain as many images as possible. Data engineering practices are more inclined towards industry participants, as evidenced by the leaderboards being mostly occupied by companies with invincible hardware and data scales","In terms of depth vs breadth, VGGFace2 stands as the dataset with the most depth among the 3. Although it contains a smaller number of subjects, it includes a large number of images per subject. It lets models focus on intra-class variations such as lighting, age, pose, etc. On the other hand, MS-Celeb-1M and Megface are datasets of breadth, in other words, they contain a lot of subjects but not particularly many images per subject. They let models cover sufficiently different appearances of different people. In terms of long tail distribution, VGGFace2 uses the head part of the distribution, Megaface uses the entire distribution to have as many images as possible, and different challenges of MS-Celeb-1M use the central or long tail part of the distribution. In terms of data engineering, the Megaface and MS-Celeb-1M datasets are usually filtered and cleaned to increase the performance of trained models. However, the leaders in this aspect are industry companies that hold computational capacity and data.","Depth v.s. breadth. These large training sets are expanded from depth or breadth. VGGface2 provides a large-scale training dataset of depth, which have limited number of subjects but many images for each subjects. The depth of dataset enforces the trained model to address a wide range intra-class variations, such as lighting, age, and pose. In contrast, MS-Celeb-1M and Mageface (Challenge 2) offers large-scale training datasets of breadth, which contains many subject but limited images for each subjects. The breadth of dataset ensures the trained model to cover the sufficiently variable appearance of various people. Cao et al. [39] conducted a systematic studies on model training using VGGface2 and MS-Celeb-1M, and found an optimal model by first training on MS-Celeb-1M (breadth) and then fine-tuning on VGGface2 (depth). Long tail distribution. The utilization of long tail distribution is different among datasets. For example, in Challenge 2 of MS-Celeb-1M, the novel set specially uses the tailed data to study low-shot learning; central part of the long tail distribution is used by the Challenge 1 of MS-Celeb-1M and images’ number is approximately limited to 100 for each celebrity; VGGface and VGGface2 only use the head part to construct deep databases; Megaface utilizes the whole distribution to contain as many images as possible, the minimal number of images is 3 per person and the maximum is 2469. Data engineering. Several popular benchmarks, such as LFW unrestricted protocol, Megaface Challenge 1, MS-Celeb-1M Challenge 1&2, explicitly encourage researchers to collect and clean a large-scale data set for enhancing the capability of deep neural network. Although data engineering is a valuable problem to computer vision researchers, this protocol is more incline to the industry participants. As evidence, the leaderboards of these experiments are mostly occupied by the companies holding invincible hardwares and data scales. This phenomenon may not be beneficial for developments of new models in academic community."
"What are some methods that have been proposed to address the security vulnerabilities of deep face recognition systems, such as presentation attacks and adversarial attacks?","Several methods have been proposed to address the security vulnerabilities of deep face recognition systems, including presentation attacks and adversarial attacks. These methods include:

1. Two-stream CNNs that use local features and holistic depth maps to detect spoofing faces [211].
2. Training CNNs using both single frames and multiple frames with five scales as input [273].
3. Applying LSTM units on top of CNN to obtain end-to-end features for recognizing spoofing faces [274].
4. Fine-tuning pretrained networks by training sets of real and fake images [275, 276].
5. Inversely decomposing spoof faces into live faces and spoof noise patterns [277].
6. Detecting adversarial samples by characterizing abnormal filter response behavior in the hidden layers and removing the most problematic filters [280].
7. Providing open source implementations of adversarial detection and mitigation algorithms [281].
8. Using NbNets to reconstruct fake faces using stolen deep templates [282].

These methods aim to increase the security and robustness of deep face recognition systems against various types of attacks, such as presentation attacks and adversarial attacks","Despite some defense systems for face spoofing that use two-stream CNN, classification with CNN, and LSTM, there is still a presentation attack with a 3D model that can crack them. Also, since the root cause of adversarial perturbations is unclear, methods like detecting and removing vulnerable layers are insufficient. In order to mitigate all different types of FR attacks, continued research in this direction is necessary.","With the success of FR techniques, various types of attacks, such as face spoofing and adversarial perturbations, are becoming large threats. Face spoofing involves presenting a fake face to the biometric sensor using a printed photograph, worn mask, or even an image displayed on another electronic device. In order to defense this type of attack, several methods are proposed [211, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279]. Atoum et al. [211] proposed a novel two-stream CNN in which the local features discriminate the spoof patches that are independent of the spatial face areas, and holistic depth maps ensure that the input live sample has a face-like depth. Yang et al. [273] trained a CNN using both a single frame and multiple frames with five scales as input, and using the live/spoof label as the output. Taken the sequence of video frames as input, Xu et al. [274] applied LSTM units on top of CNN to obtain end-to-end features to recognize spoofing faces which leveraged the local and dense property from convolution operation and learned the temporal structure using LSTM units. Li et al. [275] and Patel et al. [276] fine-tuned their networks from a pretrained model by training sets of real and fake images. Jourabloo et al. [277] proposed to inversely decompose a spoof face into the live face and the spoof noise pattern. Adversarial perturbation is the other type of attack which can be defined as the addition of a minimal vector r such that with addition of this vector into the input image x, i.e. (x+r), the deep learning models misclassifies the input while people will not. Recently, more and more work has begun to focus on solving this perturbation of FR. Goswami et al. [280] proposed to detect adversarial samples by characterizing abnormal filter response behavior in the hidden layers and increase the network’s robustness by removing the most problematic filters. Goel et al. [281] provided an open source implementation of adversarial detection and mitigation algorithms. Despite of progresses of anti-attack algorithms, attack methods are updated as well and remind us the need to further increase security and robustness in FR systems, for example, Mai et al. [282] proposed a neighborly de-convolutional neural network (NbNet) to reconstruct a fake face using the stolen deep templates. •Security issues. Presentation attack [289], adversarial attack [280, 281, 290], template attack [291] and digital manipulation attack [292, 293] are developing to threaten the security of deep face recognition systems. 1) Presentation attack with 3D silicone mask, which exhibits skin-like appearance and facial motion, challenges current anti-sproofing methods [294]. 2) Although adversarial perturbation detection and mitigation methods are recently proposed [280][281], the root cause of adversarial vulnerability is unclear and thus new types of adversarial attacks are still upgraded continuously [295, 296]. 3) The stolen deep feature template can be used to recover its facial appearance, and how to generate cancelable template without loss of accuracy is another important issue. 4) Digital manipulation attack, made feasible by GANs, can generate entirely or partially modified photorealistic faces by expression swap, identity swap, attribute manipulation and entire face synthesis, which remains a main challenge for the security of deep FR."
What are some common methods used in facial recognition and how do they compare in terms of effectiveness and challenges?,"Facial recognition (FR) techniques can be broadly classified into traditional and deep learning-based methods. Traditional methods include local-feature-based FR, which uses handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and holistic approaches, which derive a low-dimensional representation of the face through certain distribution assumptions. These methods have been shown to be effective in controlled environments but struggle with uncontrolled facial changes, such as lighting, pose, expression, and disguise.

Deep learning-based methods, on the other hand, have shown promising results in addressing these challenges. These methods use neural networks to learn a robust representation of the face, which can be more effective in real-world applications. DeepFace, a 9-layer model trained on 4 million facial images, achieved SOTA accuracy on the LFW benchmark in 2014, and subsequent deep learning-based methods have further improved the accuracy to above 99.80% in just three years.

However, despite the progress made by deep learning-based methods, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as privacy concerns and the need for better understanding of the ""identity capacity"" of deep representations. Additionally, deep learning-based methods require large amounts of training data, which can be difficult to obtain in real-world applications.

In summary, traditional methods have been shown to be effective in controlled environments but struggle with uncontrolled facial changes, while deep learning-based methods have shown promising results in addressing these challenges but require large amounts of training data and raise privacy concerns","There are broadly 4 methods that are used in FR. Holistic methods were the first-ever attempt to solve the FR problem. But they were too primitive and could not account for uncontrolled facial changes that did not fit its assumptions. Then, there are local feature-based methods that try to extract invariant properties with local filtering. However, although better than holistic methods, these are also short of complexity and capacity to address the vastness of facial appearances. The first learning-based methods also lacked the robustness to address the non-linearity and complexity of FR. Also, the efforts that were made in this direction were too scattered and there were no traditional methods that could address the FR problem entirely. Afterward, deep learning based methods were introduced which surpassed the human ability in FR. Unfortunately, these methods are prone to adversarial noises and need large datasets. In particular, designing bigger and bigger datasets is becoming a privacy issue, that is yet to be handled by deep FR models.","Face recognition (FR) has been the prominent biometric technique for identity authentication and has been widely used in many areas, such as military, finance, public security and daily life.

There was no any integrated technique to address these unconstrained challenges integrally. As a result, with continuous efforts of more than a decade, “shallow” methods only improved the accuracy of the LFW benchmark to about 95% [15], which indicates that “shallow” methods are insufficient to extract stable identity feature invariant to real-world changes.

Deep learning technique has reshaped the research landscape of FR in almost all aspects such as algorithm designs, training/test datasets, application scenarios and even the evaluation protocols. Therefore, it is of great significance to review the breakthrough and rapid development process in recent years. There have been several surveys on FR [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and its subdomains, and they mostly summarized and compared a diverse set of techniques related to a specific FR scene, such as illumination-invariant FR [29], 3D FR [28], pose-invariant FR [30][31]. Unfortunately, due to their earlier publication dates, none of them covered the deep learning methodology that is most successful nowadays. This survey focuses only on recognition problem, and one can refer to Ranjan et al. [32] for a brief review of a full deep FR pipeline with detection and alignment, or refer to Jin et al. [33] for a survey of face alignment. Specifically, the major contributions of this survey are as follows: Despite the high accuracy in the LFW [23] and Megaface [44, 164] benchmarks, the performance of FR models still hardly meets the requirements in real-world application. A conjecture in industry is made that results of generic deep models can be improved simply by collecting big datasets of the target scene. However, this holds only to a certain degree. More and more concerns on privacy may make the collection and human-annotation of face data become illegal in the future. Therefore, significant efforts have been paid to design excellent algorithms to address the specific problems with limited data in these realistic scenes. In this section, we present several special algorithms of FR. •Privacy-preserving face recognition. With the leakage of biological data, privacy concerns are raising nowadays. Facial images can predict not only demographic information such as gender, age, or race, but even the genetic information [297]. Recently, the pioneer works such as Semi-Adversarial Networks [298, 299, 285] have explored to generate a recognizable biometric templates that can hidden some of the private information presented in the facial images. Further research on the principles of visual cryptography, signal mixing and image perturbation to protect users’ privacy on stored face templates are essential for addressing public concern on privacy. •Understanding deep face recognition. Deep face recognition systems are now believed to surpass human performance in most scenarios [300]. There are also some interesting attempts to apply deep models to assist human operators for face verification [183][300]. Despite this progress, many fundamental questions are still open, such as what is the “identity capacity” of a deep representation [301]? Why deep neural networks, rather than humans, are easily fooled by adversarial samples? While bigger and bigger training dataset by itself cannot solve this problem, deeper understanding on these questions may help us to build robust applications in real world. Recently, a new benchmark called TALFW has been proposed to explore this issue [93]."
How does the contrastive loss function work in deep face recognition?,"The contrastive loss function works by pulling together positive pairs (i.e., matching faces) and pushing apart negative pairs (i.e., non-matching faces) in the feature space. It does this by maximizing the distance between negative pairs and minimizing the distance between positive pairs, where the distance is measured using a Euclidean metric. The loss function is defined as:

L = (1/2) \* (y \* d(x_i, x_j) - d(x_i, x_j) + ε) + (1/2) \* (1 - y \* d(x_i, x_j) + ε)

where y is a binary label indicating whether the two faces are matching or non-matching, d(x_i, x_j) is the Euclidean distance between the two faces, and ε is a margin parameter that controls the separation between the positive and negative pairs. The goal of the contrastive loss function is to learn a representation that maximizes the similarity between matching faces and minimizes the similarity between non-matching faces","In Euclidean space, contrastive loss, pulls together positive pairs and pushes apart negative pairs: \begin{split}\mathcal{L}=&y_{ij}max\left(0,\left\|f(x_{i})-f(x_{j})\right\|_{2}-\epsilon^{+}\right)\\&+(1-y_{ij})max\left(0,\epsilon^{-}-\left\|f(x_{i})-f(x_{j})\right\|_{2}\right)\end{split}(2)where y_{ij}=1 means x_{i} and x_{j} are matching samples and y_{ij}=0 means non-matching samples. f(\cdot) is the feature embedding, \epsilon^{+} and \epsilon^{-} control the margins of the matching and non-matching pairs respectively. However, the problem is that the margin parameters are difficult to choose.","Euclidean-distance-based loss is a metric learning method [118, 119] that embeds images into Euclidean space in which intra-variance is reduced and inter-variance is enlarged. The contrastive loss and the triplet loss are the commonly used loss functions. The contrastive loss [35, 21, 36, 61, 120] requires face image pairs, and then pulls together positive pairs and pushes apart negative pairs.\begin{split}\mathcal{L}=&y_{ij}max\left(0,\left\|f(x_{i})-f(x_{j})\right\|_{2}-\epsilon^{+}\right)\\&+(1-y_{ij})max\left(0,\epsilon^{-}-\left\|f(x_{i})-f(x_{j})\right\|_{2}\right)\end{split}(2)where y_{ij}=1 means x_{i} and x_{j} are matching samples and y_{ij}=0 means non-matching samples. f(\cdot) is the feature embedding, \epsilon^{+} and \epsilon^{-} control the margins of the matching and non-matching pairs respectively. DeepID2 [21] combined the face identification (softmax) and verification (contrastive loss) supervisory signals to learn a discriminative representation, and joint Bayesian (JB) was applied to obtain a robust embedding space. Extending from DeepID2 [21], DeepID2+ [35] increased the dimension of hidden representations and added supervision to early convolutional layers. DeepID3 [36] further introduced VGGNet and GoogleNet to their work. However, the main problem with the contrastive loss is that the margin parameters are often difficult to choose. Contrary to contrastive loss that considers the absolute distances of the matching pairs and non-matching pairs, triplet loss considers the relative difference of the distances between them. Along with FaceNet [38] proposed by Google, Triplet loss [38, 37, 81, 80, 58, 60] was introduced into FR. It requires the face triplets, and then it minimizes the distance between an anchor and a positive sample of the same identity and maximizes the distance between the anchor and a negative sample of a different identity. FaceNet made \left\|f(x_{i}^{a})-f(x_{i}^{p})\right\|_{2}^{2}+\alpha<-\left\|f(x_{i}^{a})-f(x_{i}^{n})\right\|_{2}^{2} using hard triplet face samples, where x_{i}^{a}, x_{i}^{p} and x_{i}^{n} are the anchor, positive and negative samples, respectively, \alpha is a margin and f(\cdot) represents a nonlinear transformation embedding an image into a feature space. Inspired by FaceNet [38], TPE [81] and TSE [80] learned a linear projection W to construct triplet loss. Other methods optimize deep models using both triplet loss and softmax loss [59, 58, 60, 121]. They first train networks with softmax and then fine-tune them with triplet loss."
How do angular/cosine-margin-based loss functions improve the separability of learned features in deep face recognition?	,"Angular/cosine-margin-based loss functions improve the separability of learned features in deep face recognition by explicitly adding discriminative constraints on a hypersphere manifold, which matches the prior that human faces lie on a manifold","Angular/cosine-margin-based loss allows the separation of learned features with larger angular/cosine distance. When the bias is removed and the weights are normalized in softmax, the outcome only depends on the angle between the weight and the features. Based on the prior that the human face lies on a manifold, the angular/cosine-margin-based loss explicitly adds discriminative constraints on a hypersphere manifold.","In 2017, people had a deeper understanding of loss function in deep FR and thought that samples should be separated more strictly to avoid misclassifying the difficult samples. Angular/cosine-margin-based loss [104, 84, 105, 106, 108] is proposed to make learned features potentially separable with a larger angular/cosine distance. The decision boundary in softmax loss is \left(W_{1}-W_{2}\right)x+b_{1}-b_{2}=0, where x is feature vector, W_{i} and b_{i} are weights and bias in softmax loss, respectively. Liu et al. [104] reformulated the original softmax loss into a large-margin softmax (L-Softmax) loss. They constrain b_{1}=b_{2}=0, so the decision boundaries for class 1 and class 2 become \left\|x\right\|\left(\left\|W_{1}\right\|cos\left(m\theta_{1}\right)-\left\|W_{2}\right\|cos\left(\theta_{2}\right)\right)=0 and \left\|x\right\|\left(\left\|W_{1}\right\|\left\|W_{2}\right\|cos\left(\theta_{1}\right)-cos\left(m\theta_{2}\right)\right)=0, respectively, where m is a positive integer introducing an angular margin, and \theta_{i} is the angle between W_{i} and x. Due to the non-monotonicity of the cosine function, a piece-wise function is applied in L-softmax to guarantee the monotonicity. The loss function is defined as follows:\mathcal{L}_{i}=-log\left(\frac{e^{\left\|W_{yi}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|\varphi(\theta_{yi})}}{e^{\left\|W_{yi}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|\varphi(\theta_{yi})+\sum_{j\neq y_{i}}e^{\left\|W_{yi}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|cos(\theta_{j})}}}\right)(4)where\varphi(\theta)=(-1)^{k}cos(m\theta)-2k,\theta\in\left[\frac{k\pi}{m},\frac{(k+1)\pi}{m}\right](5)Considering that L-Softmax is difficult to converge, it is always combined with softmax loss to facilitate and ensure the convergence. Therefore, the loss function is changed into: f_{y_{i}}=\frac{\lambda\left\|W_{y_{i}}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|cos(\theta_{y_{i}})+\left\|W_{y_{i}}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|\varphi(\theta_{y_{i}})}{1+\lambda}, where \lambda is a dynamic hyper-parameter. Based on L-Softmax, A-Softmax loss [84] further normalized the weight W by L2 norm (\left\|W\right\|=1) such that the normalized vector will lie on a hypersphere, and then the discriminative face features can be learned on a hypersphere manifold with an angular margin (Fig. 6). Liu et al. [108] introduced a deep hyperspherical convolution network (SphereNet) that adopts hyperspherical convolution as its basic convolution operator and is supervised by angular-margin-based loss. To overcome the optimization difficulty of L-Softmax and A-Softmax, which incorporate the angular margin in a multiplicative manner, ArcFace [106] and CosFace [105], AMS loss [107] respectively introduced an additive angular/cosine margin cos(\theta+m) and cos\theta-m. They are extremely easy to implement without tricky hyper-parameters \lambda, and are more clear and able to converge without the softmax supervision. The decision boundaries under the binary classification case are given in Table V. Based on large margin, FairLoss [122] and AdaptiveFace [123] further proposed to adjust the margins for different classes adaptively to address the problem of unbalanced data. Compared to Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss explicitly adds discriminative constraints on a hypershpere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that human face lies on a manifold. However, Wang et al. [124] showed that angular/cosine-margin-based loss can achieve better results on a clean dataset, but is vulnerable to noise and becomes worse than center loss and softmax in the high-noise region as shown in Fig. 7."
How does normalizing the features and weights in the softmax loss function improve the performance of deep face recognition systems?	,Normalizing the features and weights in the softmax loss function improves the performance of deep face recognition systems by reducing the impact of outliers and improving the generalization of the model,"Normalizing the weights only can help angular/cosine-margin-based loss to make the learned features more discriminative, whereas normalizing only the learned features can help overcome the bias to the sample distribution of the softmax. Since L2-norms of learned features with softmax loss were observed to be reflective of the quality of the face, making all the features have the same L2-norm may help to give similar attention to all different qualities of samples. Lastly, normalizing both the weights and features has become a common method since it was proven necessary by Wang et al. It is difficult to give more specific reasons why normalizing helps softmax loss, as most of the explanations come from referenced papers.","In 2017, in addition to reformulating softmax loss into an angular/cosine-margin-based loss as mentioned above, some works tries to normalize the features and weights in loss functions to improve the model performance, which can be written as follows:\hat{W}=\frac{W}{\left\|W\right\|},\hat{x}=\alpha\frac{x}{\left\|x\right\|}(6)where \alpha is a scaling parameter, x is the learned feature vector, W is weight of last fully connected layer. Scaling x to a fixed radius \alpha is important, as Wang et al. [110] proved that normalizing both features and weights to 1 will make the softmax loss become trapped at a very high value on the training set. After that, the loss function, e.g. softmax, can be performed using the normalized features and weights.  Some papers [84, 108] first normalized the weights only and then added angular/cosine margin into loss functions to make the learned features be discriminative. In contrast, some works, such as [109, 111], adopted feature normalization only to overcome the bias to the sample distribution of the softmax. Based on the observation of [125] that the L2-norm of features learned using the softmax loss is informative of the quality of the face, L2-softmax [109] enforced all the features to have the same L2-norm by feature normalization such that similar attention is given to good quality frontal faces and blurry faces with extreme pose. Rather than scaling x to the parameter \alpha, Hasnat et al. [111] normalized features with \hat{x}=\frac{x-\mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^{2}}}, where \mu and \sigma^{2} are the mean and variance. Ring loss [117] encouraged the norm of samples being value R (a learned parameter) rather than explicit enforcing through a hard normalization operation. Moreover, normalizing both features and weights [110, 112, 115, 105, 106] has become a common strategy. Wang et al. [110] explained the necessity of this normalization operation from both analytic and geometric perspectives. After normalizing features and weights, CoCo loss [112] optimized the cosine distance among data features, and Hasnat et al. [115] used the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) mixture model as the theoretical basis to develop a novel vMF mixture loss and its corresponding vMF deep features."
What are some common metrics used to evaluate the performance of face recognition systems?,"Common metrics used to evaluate the performance of face recognition systems include:

1. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Estimated Mean Accuracy (Acc) for face verification tasks.
2. Rank-N and Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) for close-set face identification.
3. Precision-Coverage curve for open-set face identification.
4. False Negative Identification Rate (FNIR) and False Positive Identification Rate (FPIR) for open-set face identification, as measured by the Decision Error Tradeoff (DET) curve.

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of face recognition systems in different scenarios and tasks, and are widely used in the field","Common metrics that are used to evaluate the accuracy of FR models are: ROC, Acc. for face verification; rank-N and CMC curve for closed-set face identification, and DET curve for open-set face identification. Also, the metrics for the complexity and size of FR models are important. Lastly, the metrics that measure the age/gender/racial bias of the FR models are becoming necessary.","•We present a comparison and analysis on public available databases that are of vital importance for both model training and testing. Major FR benchmarks, such as LFW [23], IJB-A/B/C [41, 42, 43], Megaface [44], and MS-Celeb-1M [45], are reviewed and compared, in term of the four aspects: training methodology, evaluation tasks and metrics, and recognition scenes, which provides an useful reference for training and testing deep FR. In order to evaluate whether our deep models can solve the different problems of FR in real life, many testing datasets are designed to evaluate the models in different tasks, i.e. face verification, close-set face identification and open-set face identification. In either task, a set of known subjects is initially enrolled in the system (the gallery), and during testing, a new subject (the probe) is presented. Face verification computes one-to-one similarity between the gallery and probe to determine whether the two images are of the same subject, whereas face identification computes one-to-many similarity to determine the specific identity of a probe face. When the probe appears in the gallery identities, this is referred to as closed-set identification; when the probes include those who are not in the gallery, this is open-set identification. Face verification is relevant to access control systems, re-identification, and application independent evaluations of FR algorithms. It is classically measured using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and estimated mean accuracy (Acc). At a given threshold (the independent variable), ROC analysis measures the true accept rate (TAR), which is the fraction of genuine comparisons that correctly exceed the threshold, and the false accept rate (FAR), which is the fraction of impostor comparisons that incorrectly exceed the threshold. And Acc is a simplified metric introduced by LFW [23], which represents the percentage of correct classifications. With the development of deep FR, more accurate recognitions are required. Customers concern more about the TAR when FAR is kept in a very low rate in most security certification scenario. PaSC [179] reports TAR at a FAR of 10^{-2}; IJB-A [41] evaluates TAR at a FAR of 10^{-3}; Megaface [44, 164] focuses on TAR@10^{-6}FAR; especially, in MS-celeb-1M challenge 3 [163], TAR@10^{-9}FAR is reported. Close-set face identification is relevant to user driven searches (e.g., forensic identification), rank-N and cumulative match characteristic (CMC) is commonly used metrics in this scenario. Rank-N is based on what percentage of probe searches return the probe’s gallery mate within the top k rank-ordered results. The CMC curve reports the percentage of probes identified within a given rank (the independent variable). IJB-A/B/C [41, 42, 43] concern on the rank-1 and rank-5 recognition rate. The MegaFace challenge [44, 164] systematically evaluates rank-1 recognition rate function of increasing number of gallery distractors (going from 10 to 1 Million), the results of the SOTA evaluated on MegaFace challenge are listed in Table IX. Rather than rank-N and CMC, MS-Celeb-1M [45] further applies a precision-coverage curve to measure identification performance under a variable threshold t. The probe is rejected when its confidence score is lower than t. The algorithms are compared in term of what fraction of passed probes, i.e. coverage, with a high recognition precision, e.g. 95% or 99%, the results of the SOTA evaluated on MS-Celeb-1M challenge are listed in Table X. •Remaining challenges defined by non-saturated benchmark datasets. Three current major datasets, namely, MegaFace [44, 164] , MS-Celeb-1M [45] and IJB-A/B/C [41, 42, 43], are corresponding to large-scale FR with a very large number of candidates, low/one-shot FR and large pose-variance FR which will be the focus of research in the future. Although the SOTA algorithms can be over 99.9 percent accurate on LFW [23] and Megaface [44, 164] databases, fundamental challenges such as matching faces cross ages [181], poses [188], sensors, or styles still remain. For both datasets and algorithms, it is necessary to measure and address the racial/gender/age biases of deep FR in future research. •Pursuit of extreme accuracy and efficiency. Many killer-applications, such as watch-list surveillance or financial identity verification, require high matching accuracy at very low alarm rate, e.g. 10^{-9}. It is still a big challenge even with deep learning on massive training data. Meanwhile, deploying deep face recognition on mobile devices pursues the minimum size of feature representation and compressed deep network. It is of great significance for both industry and academic to explore this extreme face-recognition performance beyond human imagination. It is also exciting to constantly push the performance limits of the algorithm after it has already surpassed human. Open-set face identification is relevant to high throughput face search systems (e.g., de-duplication, watch list identification), where the recognition system should reject unknown/unseen subjects (probes who do not present in gallery) at test time. At present, there are very few databases covering the task of open-set FR. IJB-A/B/C [41], [42], [43] benchmarks introduce a decision error tradeoff (DET) curve to characterize the the false negative identification rate (FNIR) as function of the false positive identification rate (FPIR). FPIR measures what fraction of comparisons between probe templates and non-mate gallery templates result in a match score exceeding T . At the same time, FNIR measures what fraction of probe searches will fail to match a mated gallery template above a score of T . The algorithms are compared in term of the FNIR at a low FPIR, e.g. 1% or 10%, the results of the SOTA evaluated on IJB-A dataset as listed in Table XI."
"Can the methods of ""one-to-many augmentation"" like data augmentation and 3D face reconstruction effectively improve the performance of deep FR algorithms in terms of accuracy and diversity of training data?","Yes.

The methods of ""one-to-many augmentation"" such as data augmentation and 3D face reconstruction have been shown to effectively improve the performance of deep FR algorithms in terms of accuracy and diversity of training data. These methods can generate a large number of diverse training examples from a single input image, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model. Additionally, the use of 3D face reconstruction can provide more detailed and realistic information about the face, which can improve the accuracy of the FR algorithm","In terms of accuracy, the paper mentions a set of work done on assembled multi-input networks that used ""one-to-many augmentation"" methods to expand their dataset and achieve better results compared to individual networks. In terms of diversity, all data augmentation, 3D face reconstruction, autoencoders, and especially GANs were found to be effective in generating faces in certain poses, angles, with different expressions, etc.","Collecting a large database is extremely expensive and time consuming. The methods of “one-to-many augmentation” can mitigate the challenges of data collection, and they can be used to augment not only training data but also the gallery of test data. we categorized them into four classes: data augmentation, 3D model, autoencoder model and GAN model. Data augmentation. Common data augmentation methods consist of photometric transformations [75, 22] and geometric transformations, such as oversampling (multiple patches obtained by cropping at different scales) [22], mirroring [153], and rotating [154] the images. Recently, data augmentation has been widely used in deep FR algorithms [58, 59, 60, 35, 21, 36, 61, 62]. for example, Sun et al. [21] cropped 400 face patches varying in positions, scales, and color channels and mirrored the images. Liu et al. [58] generated seven overlapped image patches centered at different landmarks on the face region and trained them with seven CNNs with the same structure. 3D model. 3D face reconstruction is also a way to enrich the diversity of training data. They utilize 3D structure information to model the transformation between poses. 3D models first use 3D face data to obtain morphable displacement fields and then apply them to obtain 2D face data in different pose angles. There is a large number of papers about this domain, but we only focus on the 3D face reconstruction using deep methods or used for deep FR. In [47], Masi et al. generated face images with new intra-class facial appearance variations, including pose, shape and expression, and then trained a 19-layer VGGNet with both real and augmented data. Masi et al. [48] used generic 3D faces and rendered fixed views to reduce much of the computational effort. Richardson et al. [49] employed an iterative 3D CNN by using a secondary input channel to represent the previous network’s output as an image for reconstructing a 3D face as shown in Fig. 13. Dou et al. [51] used a multi-task CNN to divide 3D face reconstruction into neutral 3D reconstruction and expressive 3D reconstruction. Tran et al. [53] directly regressed 3D morphable face model (3DMM) [155] parameters from an input photo by a very deep CNN architecture. An et al. [156] synthesized face images with various poses and expressions using the 3DMM method, then reduced the gap between synthesized data and real data with the help of MMD. 2) Assembled Networks : Multi-input networks. In “one-to-many augmentation”, multiple images with variety are generated from one image in order to augment training data. Taken these multiple images as input, multiple networks are also assembled together to extract and combine features of different type of inputs, which can outperform an individual network. In [58], [59], [60], [99], [34], [21], [35], assembled networks are built after different face patches are cropped, and then different types of patches are fed into different sub-networks for representation extraction. By combining the results of subnetworks, the performance can be improved. Other papers [96], [95], [98] used assembled networks to recognize images. Autoencoder model. Rather than reconstructing 3D models from a 2D image and projecting it back into 2D images of different poses, autoencoder models can generate 2D target images directly. Taken a face image and a pose code encoding a target pose as input, an encoder first learns pose-invariant face representation, and then a decoder generates a face image with the same identity viewed at the target pose by using the pose-invariant representation and the pose code. For example, given the target pose codes, multi-view perceptron (MVP) [55] trained some deterministic hidden neurons to learn pose-invariant face representations, and simultaneously trained some random hidden neurons to capture pose features, then a decoder generated the target images by combining pose-invariant representations with pose features. As shown in Fig. 14, Yim et al. [157] and Qian et al. [158] introduced an auxiliary CNN to generate better images viewed at the target poses. First, an autoencoder generated the desired pose image, then the auxiliary CNN reconstructed the original input image back from the generated target image, which guarantees that the generated image is identity-preserving. In [65], two groups of units are embedded between encoder and decoder. The identity units remain unchanged and the rotation of images is achieved by taking actions to pose units at each time step. GAN model. In GAN models, a generator aims to fool a discriminator through generating images that resemble the real images, while the discriminator aims to discriminate the generated samples from the real ones. By this minimax game between generator and discriminator, GAN can successfully generate photo-realistic images with different poses. After using a 3D model to generate profile face images, DA-GAN [56] refined the images by a GAN, which combines prior knowledge of the data distribution and knowledge of faces (pose and identity perception loss). CVAE-GAN [159] combined a variational auto-encoder with a GAN for augmenting data, and took advantages of both statistic and pairwise feature matching to make the training process converge faster and more stably. In addition to synthesizing diverse faces from noise, some papers also explore to disentangle the identity and variation, and synthesize new faces by exchanging identity and variation from different people. In CG-GAN [160], a generator directly resolves each representation of input image into a variation code and an identity code and regroups these codes for cross-generating, simultaneously, a discriminator ensures the reality of generated images. Bao et al. [161] extracted identity representation of one input image and attribute representation of any other input face image, then synthesized new faces by recombining these representations. This work shows superior performance in generating realistic and identity preserving face images, even for identities outside the training dataset. Unlike previous methods that treat classifier as a spectator, FaceID-GAN [162] proposed a three-player GAN where the classifier cooperates together with the discriminator to compete with the generator from two different aspects, i.e. facial identity and image quality respectively."
"How has the evolution of network architectures in deep face recognition systems, such as the transition from AlexNet to ResNet and SENet, impacted the performance of these systems?	","The evolution of network architectures in deep face recognition systems, from AlexNet to ResNet and SENet, has significantly improved the performance of these systems. The use of deeper and more complex networks, along with advanced training techniques, has led to a dramatic increase in accuracy, from 97.35% in 2014 to over 99.80% in recent years","As deep FR models followed the footsteps of deep object classification network architectures the performance got better, training got more controllable, and models got deeper. It started with DeepFace which was based on AlexNet that achieved 97.35% on the LFW benchmark. Then came the FaceNet based on GoogleNet which achieved 99.63%. VGGFace with a procedure to collect the large-scale dataset on the web and using the VGGNet architecture reached 98.95%. SphereFace used ResNet to achieve 99.42% accuracy. After the new VGGFace2 dataset was introduced Cao et al. trained a SENet-based architecture to achieve the SOTA for several datasets.","Mainstream architectures. The commonly used network architectures of deep FR have always followed those of deep object classification and evolved from AlexNet to SENet rapidly. We present the most influential architectures of deep object classification and deep face recognition in chronological order 111The time we present is when the paper was published. in Fig. 8.  With the evolved architectures and advanced training techniques, such as batch normalization (BN), the network becomes deeper and the training becomes more controllable. Following these architectures in object classification, the networks in deep FR are also developed step by step, and the performance of deep FR is continually improving. We present these mainstream architectures of deep FR in Fig. 9. In 2014, DeepFace [20] was the first to use a nine-layer CNN with several locally connected layers. With 3D alignment for face processing, it reaches an accuracy of 97.35% on LFW. In 2015, FaceNet [38] used a large private dataset to train a GoogleNet. It adopted a triplet loss function based on triplets of roughly aligned matching/nonmatching face patches generated by a novel online triplet mining method and achieved good performance of 99.63%. In the same year, VGGface [37] designed a procedure to collect a large-scale dataset from the Internet. It trained the VGGNet on this dataset and then fine-tuned the networks via a triplet loss function similar to FaceNet. VGGface obtains an accuracy of 98.95%. In 2017, SphereFace [84] used a 64-layer ResNet architecture and proposed the angular softmax (A-Softmax) loss to learn discriminative face features with angular margin. It boosts the achieves to 99.42% on LFW. In the end of 2017, a new large-scale face dataset, namely VGGface2 [39], was introduced, which consists of large variations in pose, age, illumination, ethnicity and profession. Cao et al. first trained a SENet with MS-celeb-1M dataset [45] and then fine-tuned the model with VGGface2 [39], and achieved the SOTA performance on the IJB-A [41] and IJB-B [42]. In 2014, DeepFace [20] achieved the SOTA accuracy on the famous LFW benchmark [23], approaching human performance on the unconstrained condition for the first time (DeepFace: 97.35% vs. Human: 97.53%), by training a 9-layer model on 4 million facial images. Inspired by this work, research focus has shifted to deep-learning-based approaches, and the accuracy was dramatically boosted to above 99.80% in just three years. Deep learning technique has reshaped the research landscape of FR in almost all aspects such as algorithm designs, training/test datasets, application scenarios and even the evaluation protocols. Therefore, it is of great significance to review the breakthrough and rapid development process in recent years. There have been several surveys on FR [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and its subdomains, and they mostly summarized and compared a diverse set of techniques related to a specific FR scene, such as illumination-invariant FR [29], 3D FR [28], pose-invariant FR [30][31]. Unfortunately, due to their earlier publication dates, none of them covered the deep learning methodology that is most successful nowadays. This survey focuses only on recognition problem, and one can refer to Ranjan et al. [32] for a brief review of a full deep FR pipeline with detection and alignment, or refer to Jin et al. [33] for a survey of face alignment. Specifically, the major contributions of this survey are as follows:"
How do feature-based methods work in face recognition?,"Feature-based methods in face recognition derive a low-dimensional representation of the face through certain distribution assumptions, such as linear subspace, manifold, and sparse representation. These methods have been dominant in the FR community, but have limitations in addressing uncontrolled facial changes",The only feature-based method that is mentioned in the paper is the local-feature-based methods from the 2000s of Gabor and LBP that tried local filtering to extract invariant properties. But they were too rigid and lacked distinctiveness and compactness.,"Face recognition (FR) has been the prominent biometric technique for identity authentication and has been widely used in many areas, such as military, finance, public security and daily life. FR has been a long-standing research topic in the CVPR community. In the early 1990s, the study of FR became popular following the introduction of the historical Eigenface approach [1]. The milestones of feature-based FR over the past years are presented in Fig. 1, in which the times of four major technical streams are highlighted. The holistic approaches derive the low-dimensional representation through certain distribution assumptions, such as linear subspace [2][3][4], manifold [5][6][7], and sparse representation [8][9][10][11]. This idea dominated the FR community in the 1990s and 2000s. However, a well-known problem is that these theoretically plausible holistic methods fail to address the uncontrolled facial changes that deviate from their prior assumptions. In the early 2000s, this problem gave rise to local-feature-based FR. Gabor [12] and LBP [13], as well as their multilevel and high-dimensional extensions [14][15][16], achieved robust performance through some invariant properties of local filtering. Unfortunately, handcrafted features suffered from a lack of distinctiveness and compactness. In the early 2010s, learning-based local descriptors were introduced to the FR community [17][18][19], in which local filters are learned for better distinctiveness and the encoding codebook is learned for better compactness. However, these shallow representations still have an inevitable limitation on robustness against the complex nonlinear facial appearance variations."
Can adaptive-architecture networks be used in other tasks besides face recognition?,"Yes. Adaptive-architecture networks have the potential to be applied to a wide range of tasks beyond face recognition, such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and other computer vision tasks, as well as natural language processing and other domains","Adaptive-architecture networks have been successfully applied to various tasks like image classification, semantic segmentation, and more.","Adaptive-architecture networks. Considering that designing architectures manually by human experts are time-consuming and error-prone processes, there is growing interest in adaptive-architecture networks which can find well-performing architectures, e.g. the type of operation every layer executes (pooling, convolution, etc) and hyper-parameters associated with the operation (number of filters, kernel size and strides for a convolutional layer, etc), according to the specific requirements of training and testing data. Currently, neural architecture search (NAS) [130] is one of the promising methodologies, which has outperformed manually designed architectures on some tasks such as image classification [131] or semantic segmentation [132]. Zhu et al. [88] integrated NAS technology into face recognition. They used reinforcement learning [133] algorithm (policy gradient) to guide the controller network to train the optimal child architecture. Besides NAS, there are some other explorations to learn optimal architectures adaptively. For example, conditional convolutional neural network (c-CNN) [89] dynamically activated sets of kernels according to modalities of samples; Han et al. [90] proposed a novel contrastive convolution consisted of a trunk CNN and a kernel generator, which is beneficial owing to its dynamistic generation of contrastive kernels based on the pair of faces being compared."
What are the main loss functions that have been explored for improving deep FR methods and how have they evolved over time?,"The main loss functions that have been explored for improving deep FR methods are Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss, and softmax loss and its variations. These loss functions have evolved over time, with the introduction of new variants and combinations to address the challenges of FR, such as the need for discriminative features, robustness to variations, and adaptability to different data distributions. The evolution of these loss functions can be traced back to the early works of AlexNet and DeepFace, and has continued to the present day with the development of new techniques such as center loss, triplet loss, and feature normalization","There are 3 categories of loss functions for FR: Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss, and softmax loss variations. Initially, cross-entropy softmax loss was used, then some models tried using Euclidean-distance-based loss functions which started from contrastive loss and triplet loss. However, due to their instability, the center loss and its variants (range loss, center-invariant loss) were introduced. With a better understanding of loss functions for FR angular/cosine-margin-based loss functions were used. It began with a reformulation of a softmax loss called L-Softmax, later A-Softmax appeared which adopted the L-Softmax idea but tried normalizing the weights. Afterward, there were several improvements such as ArcFace, CosFace, and AMS which facilitated the convergence, while Fairloss and AdaptiveFace dealt with unbalanced data. Lastly, there are different variations of softmax that try to normalize the L2-norms (L2-softmax, Ring loss), the weights, the features, or both weights and features (CoCo loss and vMF mixture loss).","Inheriting from the object classification network such as AlexNet, the initial Deepface [20] and DeepID [34] adopted cross-entropy based softmax loss for feature learning. After that, people realized that the softmax loss is not sufficient by itself to learn discriminative features, and more researchers began to explore novel loss functions for enhanced generalization ability. This becomes the hottest research topic in deep FR research, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Before 2017, Euclidean-distance-based loss played an important role; In 2017, angular/cosine-margin-based loss as well as feature and weight normalization became popular. It should be noted that, although some loss functions share the similar basic idea, the new one is usually designed to facilitate the training procedure by easier parameter or sample selection. •A systematic review on the evolution of the network architectures and loss functions for deep FR is provided. Various loss functions are categorized into Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss and softmax loss and its variations. Both the mainstream network architectures, such as Deepface [20], DeepID series [34, 35, 21, 36], VGGFace [37], FaceNet [38], and VGGFace2 [39], and other architectures designed for FR are covered. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of deep FR from both data and algorithm aspects. For algorithms, mainstream and special network architectures are presented. Meanwhile, we categorize loss functions into Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss and variable softmax loss. For data, we summarize some commonly used datasets. Moreover, the methods of face processing are introduced and categorized as “one-to-many augmentation” and “many-to-one normalization”. Finally, the special scenes of deep FR, including video FR, 3D FR and cross-age FR, are briefly introduced. 1) Euclidean-distance-based Loss : Euclidean-distance-based loss is a metric learning method [118], [119] that embeds images into Euclidean space in which intra-variance is reduced and inter-variance is enlarged. The contrastive loss and the triplet loss are the commonly used loss functions. The contrastive loss [35], [21], [36], [61], [120] requires face image pairs, and then pulls together positive pairs and pushes apart negative pairs. L =yij max (0, ‖f (xi) − f (xj )‖2 − +) + (1 − yij )max (0, − − ‖f (xi) − f (xj )‖2 ) (2) where yij = 1 means xi and xj are matching samples and yij = 0 means non-matching samples. f (·) is the feature embedding, + and − control the margins of the matching and non-matching pairs respectively. DeepID2 [21] combined the face identification (softmax) and verification (contrastive loss) supervisory signals to learn a discriminative representation, and joint Bayesian (JB) was applied to obtain a robust embedding space. Extending from DeepID2 [21], DeepID2+ [35] increased the dimension of hidden representations and added supervision to early convolutional layers. DeepID3 [36] further introduced VGGNet and GoogleNet to their work. However, the main problem with the contrastive loss is that the margin parameters are often difficult to choose. Contrary to contrastive loss that considers the absolute distances of the matching pairs and non-matching pairs, triplet loss considers the relative difference of the distances between them. Along with FaceNet [38] proposed by Google, Triplet loss [38], [37], [81], [80], [58], [60] was introduced into FR. It requires the face triplets, and then it minimizes the distance between an anchor and a positive sample of the same identity and maximizes the distance between the anchor and a negative sample of a different identity. FaceNet made ‖f (xa i ) − f (xp i )‖2 2 + α < − ‖f (xa i ) − f (xn i )‖2 2 using hard triplet face samples, where xa i , xp i and xn i are the anchor, positive and negative samples, respectively, α is a margin and f (·) represents a nonlinear transformation embedding an image into a feature space. Inspired by FaceNet [38], TPE [81] and TSE [80] learned a linear projection W to construct triplet loss. Other methods optimize deep models using both triplet loss and softmax loss [59], [58], [60], [121]. They first train networks with softmax and then fine-tune them with triplet loss. However, the contrastive loss and triplet loss occasionally encounter training instability due to the selection of effective training samples, some paper begun to explore simple alternatives. Center loss [101] and its variants [82], [116], [102] are good choices for reducing intra-variance. The center loss [101] learned a center for each class and penalized the distances between the deep features and their corresponding class centers. This loss can be defined as follows: LC = 1 2 m∑ i=1 ‖xi − cyi ‖2 2 (3) where xi denotes the i-th deep feature belonging to the yi-th class and cyi denotes the yi-th class center of deep features. To handle the long-tailed data, a range loss [82], which is a variant of center loss, is used to minimize k greatest range’s harmonic mean values in one class and maximize the shortest interclass distance within one batch. Wu et al. [102] proposed a center-invariant loss that penalizes the difference between each center of classes. Deng et al. [116] selected the farthest intraclass samples and the nearest inter-class samples to compute a margin loss. However, the center loss and its variants suffer from massive GPU memory consumption on the classification layer, and prefer balanced and sufficient training data for each identity. 2) Angular/cosine-margin-based Loss : In 2017, people had a deeper understanding of loss function in deep FR and thought that samples should be separated more strictly to avoid misclassifying the difficult samples. Angular/cosine-margin-based loss [104], [84], [105], [106], [108] is proposed to make learned features potentially separable with a larger angular/cosine distance. The decision boundary in softmax loss is (W1 − W2) x + b1 − b2 = 0, where x is feature vector, Wi and bi are weights and bias in softmax loss, respectively. Liu et al. [104] reformulated the original softmax loss into a large-margin softmax (L-Softmax) loss. They constrain b1 = b2 = 0, so the decision boundaries for class 1 and class 2 become ‖x‖ (‖W1‖ cos (mθ1) − ‖W2‖ cos (θ2)) = 0 and ‖x‖ (‖W1‖ ‖W2‖ cos (θ1) − cos (mθ2)) = 0, respectively, where m is a positive integer introducing an angular margin, and θi is the angle between Wi and x. Due to the nonmonotonicity of the cosine function, a piece-wise function is applied in L-softmax to guarantee the monotonicity. The loss function is defined as follows: Li = −log ( e‖Wyi‖‖xi‖φ(θyi) e‖Wyi‖‖xi‖φ(θyi)+∑ j6 =yi e‖Wyi‖‖xi‖cos(θj ) ) (4) where φ(θ) = (−1)kcos(mθ) − 2k, θ ∈ [ kπ m , (k + 1)π m ] (5) Considering that L-Softmax is difficult to converge, it is always combined with softmax loss to facilitate and ensure the convergence. Therefore, the loss function is changed into: fyi = λ‖Wyi ‖‖xi‖cos(θyi )+‖Wyi ‖‖xi‖φ(θyi ) 1+λ , where λ is a dynamic hyper-parameter. Based on L-Softmax, A-Softmax loss [84] further normalized the weight W by L2 norm (‖W ‖ = 1) such that the normalized vector will lie on a hypersphere, and then the discriminative face features can be learned on a hypersphere manifold with an angular margin (Fig. 6). Liu et al. [108] introduced a deep hyperspherical convolution network (SphereNet) that adopts hyperspherical convolution as its basic convolution operator and is supervised by angular-margin-based loss. To overcome the optimization difficulty of L-Softmax and A-Softmax, which incorporate the angular margin in a multiplicative manner, ArcFace [106] and CosFace [105], AMS loss [107] respectively introduced an additive angular/cosine margin cos(θ + m) and cosθ − m. They are extremely easy to implement without tricky hyperparameters λ, and are more clear and able to converge without the softmax supervision. The decision boundaries under the binary classification case are given in Table V. Based on large margin, FairLoss [122] and AdaptiveFace [123] further proposed to adjust the margins for different classes adaptively to address the problem of unbalanced data. Compared to Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss explicitly adds discriminative constraints on a hypershpere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that human face lies on a manifold. However, Wang et al. [124] showed that angular/cosine-margin-based loss can achieve better results on a clean dataset, but is vulnerable to noise and becomes worse than center loss and softmax in the high-noise region as shown in Fig. 7. 3) Softmax Loss and its Variations : In 2017, in addition to reformulating softmax loss into an angular/cosine-margin-based loss as mentioned above, some works tries to normalize the features and weights in loss functions to improve the model performance, which can be written as follows: ˆW = W ‖W ‖ , ˆx = α x ‖x‖ (6) where α is a scaling parameter, x is the learned feature vector, W is weight of last fully connected layer. Scaling x to a fixed radius α is important, as Wang et al. [110] proved that normalizing both features and weights to 1 will make the softmax loss become trapped at a very high value on the training set. After that, the loss function, e.g. softmax, can be performed using the normalized features and weights. Some papers [84], [108] first normalized the weights only and then added angular/cosine margin into loss functions to make the learned features be discriminative. In contrast, some works, such as [109], [111], adopted feature normalization only to overcome the bias to the sample distribution of the softmax. Based on the observation of [125] that the L2-norm of features learned using the softmax loss is informative of the quality of the face, L2-softmax [109] enforced all the features to have the same L2-norm by feature normalization such that similar attention is given to good quality frontal faces and blurry faces with extreme pose. Rather than scaling x to the parameter α, Hasnat et al. [111] normalized features with ˆx = x−μ√σ2 , where μ and σ2 are the mean and variance. Ring loss [117] encouraged the norm of samples being value R (a learned parameter) rather than explicit enforcing through a hard normalization operation. Moreover, normalizing both features and weights [110], [112], [115], [105], [106] has become a common strategy. Wang et al. [110] explained the necessity of this normalization operation from both analytic and geometric perspectives. After normalizing features and weights, CoCo loss [112] optimized the cosine distance among data features, and Hasnat et al. [115] used the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) mixture model as the theoretical basis to develop a novel vMF mixture loss and its corresponding vMF deep features."
What are some of the specific challenges that FR models face in real-world applications and how have researchers attempted to address these challenges through the design of specialized algorithms?	,,"Cross-pose FR is still a challenging problem for existing algorithms and over 10% decrease in accuracy was observed in frontal-frontal to frontal-profile verification. Techniques like DREAM and PIM were employed to perform frontalization in the deep face and learn pose-invariant representations. Cross-age FR is also a natural problem as facial appearance changes over time. There were attempts to synthesize images from the same age group with a generative probabilistic model and conditional GANs were used to generate an identity-preserved face with a target age. Further, local manifold adaptation (LMA) and pyramidal adversarial discriminator approaches were tried to deal with the imperfect preservation of identities of GAN-synthesized images. Alternatively, decomposing the identity and age from each other was another direction. Latent identity analysis (LIA) and decomposing in a spherical coordinate system are some methods from that direction. Lastly, CNN fine-tuning, siamese deep network, feature extraction, and deep learning with CNN were some of the notable approaches. Makeup FR is another real-world problem that needs a solution, as makeup can drastically change the appearance of the subject. Bi-level adversarial network (BLAN) was used to generate non makeup images from makeup images. Fine-tuning the triplet network with a small makeup dataset was another try. In particular, facial disguise is a big issue for FR as people can either want to hide their identity or impersonate another one. Identity hiding increases intra-class variation, while impersonation decreases inter-class distinction. Using DCNN and finding the transformation matrix with PCA for face disguise, fine-tuning models with disguised faces, hard example mining, and learning the representation of images in colors, shapes, and textures are some of the attempts to solve the issue. NIR-VIS FR is needed to match the NIS images, (near-infrared spectrum) that usually come from surveillance contexts to VIS (visible light spectrum) images, as most of the available datasets contain VIS images. Transferring from VIS to NIR with fine-tuning, transforming NIR images to VIS with CNN, using the siamese network for each VIS and NIR respectively, dividing the network into NIR, VIS, and NIR-VIS layers to learn modality-invariant features, embedding cross-spectral face hallucination and discriminative features, and low-rank relevance and cross-modal ranking are some of the methods that were used to solve the issue. Low-resolution FR needs addressing, although deep models are mostly robust to such cases. Mapping low and high-resolution faces into the same space with CNN, using face semantic information and local structural constraints to restore the shape and detail of the images are notable approaches in this direction. Photo-sketch FR can help find suspects effectively. Approaches usually either use transfer learning to directly match photos to sketches or perform image-to-image translation (image to sketch or sketch to an image). For the first type, training with images of faces and fine-tuning with sketches is one of the attempts. For the second type, branched fully convolution network (BFCN) and lately, GAN architectures were used to translate the image to sketch or vice versa. In many real-world scenarios low-shot FR is needed where only a few data points are available. Researchers tried to either synthesize more data or learn more meaningful features. 3D models, GANs, data augmentation, hybrid classifiers, and normalization are some of the attempts that were found useful. Using not only a single image but a set of data as the smallest unit matches many of the biometric scenarios. There are 2 types of methods in set/template-based FR, either processing all the data in the set separately to find the matching score by combining the individual scores with a certain function or doing feature pooling which generates a single representation of the set and compares only them. Additionally, a deep heterogeneous feature fusion network and actor-critic reinforcement learning are some of the alternative attempts to deal with sets/templates. Video FR is also a complex problem consisting of combining the data across frames and handling individual frames with blur, pose variations, and occlusions. A neural aggregation network (NAN), combining metric and adversarial learning is some of the attempts to aggregate the frames. To deal with bad frames: deep reinforcement learning, learning blur-robust representations, and reconstruction of frames with CNN was tried. 3D FR is underdeveloped due to a lack of good datasets. Despite attempts to enlarge such datasets with 3D reconstruction from 2D images, using 2D CNN, and using 3-channel inputs, the direction is still open for exploration. Partial Face Recognition is emerging in several real-world scenarios where a decision should be made with only a part of the face available. Dividing the aligned image into multi-scale patches and Dynamic Feature Matching (DFM) are some of the approaches for Partial FR. Applying FR in mobile devices is an important problem that needs a solution under stricter conditions. Deep models like MobiFace and the multi-batch method are some of the work in this direction. However, the light networks and compressing methods as in image classification still need exploration in the FR context. Face Anti-attack systems are needed to defend from face spoofing, adversarial perturbations, etc. For face spoofing, ensuring face-like depth with two-stream CNN, classification with CNN, and LSTM for sequences of frames were tried to resolve the issue. In terms of adversarial perturbation, detecting abnormal layers of the network to increase the robustness of the model was an idea. However, the attack methods evolve as well, thus continued work in this direction is necessary. Highly biased FR datasets impose fairness issues on FR models. Thus, debiasing attempts are made by unbalanced training, attribute removal, and domain adaptation. Unbalanced training, for example, RL-RBN,  tries to remove the bias of the model by regularization (i.e adjusting the objective function). The attribute-removal method tries to learn attribute-invariant representations by removing demographic information. Lastly, domain adaptation attempts to learn domain-invariant representations to avoid any domain bias.","Despite the high accuracy in the LFW [23] and Megaface [44, 164] benchmarks, the performance of FR models still hardly meets the requirements in real-world application. A conjecture in industry is made that results of generic deep models can be improved simply by collecting big datasets of the target scene. However, this holds only to a certain degree. More and more concerns on privacy may make the collection and human-annotation of face data become illegal in the future. Therefore, significant efforts have been paid to design excellent algorithms to address the specific problems with limited data in these realistic scenes. In this section, we present several special algorithms of FR. With the emergence of mobile phones, tablets and augmented reality, FR has been applied in mobile devices. Due to computational limitations, the recognition tasks in these devices need to be carried out in a light but timely fashion. MobiFace [87] required efficient memory and low cost operators by adopting fast downsampling and bottleneck residual block, and achieves99.7% on LFW database and 91.3% on Megaface database. Tadmor et al. [263] proposed a multibatch method that first generates signatures for a minibatch of k face images and then constructs an unbiased estimate of the full gradient by relying on all k^{2}-k pairs from the minibatch. As mentioned in Section 3.2.1, light-weight deep networks [126, 127, 128, 129] perform excellently in the fundamental tasks of image classification and deserve further attention in FR tasks. Moreover, some well-known compressed networks such as Pruning [264, 265, 266], BinaryNets [267, 268, 269, 270], Mimic Networks [271, 272], also have potential to be introduced into FR. 1) Cross-Pose Face Recognition: As [182] shows that many existing algorithms suffer a decrease of over 10% from frontal-frontal to frontal-profile verification, cross-pose FR is still an extremely challenging scene. In addition to the aforementioned methods, including “one-to-many augmentation”, “many-to-one normalization” and assembled networks (Section IV and III-B.2), there are some other algorithms designed for cross-pose FR. Considering the extra burden of above methods, Cao et al. [215] attempted to perform frontalization in the deep feature space rather than the image space. A deep residual equivariant mapping (DREAM) block dynamically added residuals to an input representation to transform a profile face to a frontal image. Chen et al. [216] proposed to combine feature extraction with multi-view subspace learning to simultaneously make features be more pose-robust and discriminative. Pose Invariant Model (PIM) [217] jointly performed face frontalization and learned pose invariant representations end-to-end to allow them to mutually boost each other, and further introduced unsupervised cross-domain adversarial training and a learning to learn strategy to provide high-fidelity frontal reference face images. 2) Cross-Age Face Recognition: Cross-age FR is extremely challenging due to the changes in facial appearance by the aging process over time. One direct approach is to synthesize the desired image with target age such that the recognition can be performed in the same age group. A generative probabilistic model was used by [218] to model the facial aging process at each short-term stage. The identity-preserved conditional generative adversarial networks (IPCGANs) [219] framework utilized a conditional-GAN to generate a face in which an identity-preserved module preserved the identity information and an age classifier forced the generated face with the target age. Antipov et al. [220] proposed to age faces by GAN, but the synthetic faces cannot be directly used for face verification due to its imperfect preservation of identities. Then, they used a local manifold adaptation (LMA) approach [221] to solve the problem of [220]. In [222], high-level age-specific features conveyed by the synthesized face are estimated by a pyramidal adversarial discriminator at multiple scales to generate more lifelike facial details. An alternative to address the cross-age problem is to decompose aging and identity components separately and extract age-invariant representations. Wen et al. [192] developed a latent identity analysis (LIA) layer to separate these two components, as shown in Fig. 22. In [193], age-invariant features were obtained by subtracting age-specific factors from the representations with the help of the age estimation task. In [124], face features are decomposed in the spherical coordinate system, in which the identity-related components are represented with angular coordinates and the age-related information is encoded with radial coordinate. Additionally, there are other methods designed for cross-age FR. For example, Bianco ett al. [223] and El et al. [224] fine-tuned the CNN to transfer knowledge across age. Wang et al. [225] proposed a siamese deep network to perform multi-task learning of FR and age estimation. Li et al. [226] integrated feature extraction and metric learning via a deep CNN. 3) Makeup Face Recognition: Makeup is widely used by the public today, but it also brings challenges for FR due to significant facial appearance changes. The research on matching makeup and nonmakeup face images is receiving increasing attention. Li et al. [208] generated nonmakeup images from makeup ones by a bi-level adversarial network (BLAN) and then used the synthesized nonmakeup images for verification as shown in Fig. 23. Sun et al. [227] pretrained a triplet network on videos and fine-tuned it on a small makeup datasets. Specially, facial disguise [214], [228], [229] is a challenging research topic in makeup face recognition. By using disguise accessories such as wigs, beard, hats, mustache, and heavy makeup, disguise introduces two variations: (i) when a person wants to obfuscate his/her own identity, and (ii) another individual impersonates someone else’s identity. Obfuscation increases intra-class variations whereas impersonation reduces the inter-class dissimilarity, thereby affecting face recognition/verification task. To address this issue, a variety of methods are proposed. Zhang et al. [230] first trained two DCNNs for generic face recognition and then used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to find the transformation matrix for disguised face recognition adaptation. Kohli et al. [231] finetuned models using disguised faces. Smirnov et al. [232] proposed a hard example mining method benefitted from class-wise (Doppelganger Mining [233]) and example-wise mining to learn useful deep embeddings for disguised face recognition. Suri et al. [234] learned the representations of images in terms of colors, shapes, and textures (COST) using an unsupervised dictionary learning method, and utilized the combination of COST features and CNN features to perform recognition. 1) NIR-VIS Face Recognition: Due to the excellent performance of the near-infrared spectrum (NIS) images under low-light scenarios, NIS images are widely applied in surveillance systems. Because most enrolled databases consist of visible light (VIS) spectrum images, how to recognize a NIR face from a gallery of VIS images has been a hot topic. Saxena et al. [235] and Liu et al. [236] transferred the VIS deep networks to the NIR domain by fine-tuning. Lezama et al. [237] used a VIS CNN to recognize NIR faces by transforming NIR images to VIS faces through cross-spectral hallucination and restoring a low-rank structure for features through low-rank embedding. Reale et al. [198] trained a VISNet (for visible images) and a NIRNet (for near-infrared images), and coupled their output features by creating a siamese network. He et al. [238], [239] divided the high layer of the network into a NIR layer, a VIS layer and a NIR-VIS shared layer, then, a modality-invariant feature can be learned by the NIR-VIS shared layer. Song et al. [240] embedded cross-spectral face hallucination and discriminative feature learning into an end-to-end adversarial network. In [196], the low-rank relevance and cross-modal ranking were used to alleviate the semantic gap. 2) Low-Resolution Face Recognition: Although deep networks are robust to low resolution to a great extent, there are still a few studies focused on promoting the performance of low-resolution FR. For example, Zangeneh et al. [241] proposed a CNN with a two-branch architecture (a super-resolution network and a feature extraction network) to map the high and low-resolution face images into a common space where the intra-person distance is smaller than the interperson distance. Shen et al. [242] exploited the face semantic information and local structural constraints to better restore the shape and detail of face images. In addition, they optimized the network with perceptual and adversarial losses to produce photo-realistic results. 3) Photo-Sketch Face Recognition: The photo-sketch FR may help law enforcement to quickly identify suspects. The commonly used methods can be categorized as two classes. One is to utilize transfer learning to directly match photos to sketches. Deep networks are first trained using a large face database of photos and are then fine-tuned using small sketch database [243], [244]. The other is to use the image-to-image translation, where the photo can be transformed to a sketch or the sketch to a photo; then, FR can be performed in one domain. Zhang et al. [200] developed a fully convolutional network with generative loss and a discriminative regularizer to transform photos to sketches. Zhang et al. [245] utilized a branched fully convolutional neural network (BFCN) to generate a structure-preserved sketch and a texture-preserved sketch, and then they fused them together via a probabilistic method. Recently, GANs have achieved impressive results in image generation. Yi et al. [246], Kim et al. [247] and Zhu et al. [248] used two generators, GA and GB , to generate sketches from photos and photos from sketches, respectively (Fig. 24). Based on [248], Wang et al. [202] proposed a multi-adversarial network to avoid artifacts by leveraging the implicit presence of feature maps of different resolutions in the generator subnetwork. Similar to photo-sketch FR, photocaricature FR is one kind of heterogenous FR scenes which is challenging and important to understanding of face perception. Huo et al. [213] built a large dataset of caricatures and photos, and provided several evaluation protocols and their baseline performances for comparison. 1) Low-Shot Face Recognition: For many practical applications, such as surveillance and security, the FR system should recognize persons with a very limited number of training samples or even with only one sample. The methods of low-shot learning can be categorized as 1) synthesizing training data and 2) learning more powerful features. Hong et al. [249] generated images in various poses using a 3D face model and adopted deep domain adaptation to handle other variations, such as blur, occlusion, and expression (Fig. 25). Choe et al. [250] used data augmentation methods and a GAN for pose transition and attribute boosting to increase the size of the training dataset. Wu et al. [176] proposed a framework with hybrid classifiers using a CNN and a nearest neighbor (NN) model. Guo et al. [143] made the norms of the weight vectors of the one-shot classes and the normal classes aligned to address the data imbalance problem. Cheng et al. [137] proposed an enforced softmax that contains optimal dropout, selective attenuation, L2 normalization and model-level optimization. Yin et al. [251] augmented feature space of low-shot classes by transferring the principal components from regular to low-shot classes to encourage the variance of low-shot classes to mimic that of regular classes. 2) Set/Template-Based Face Recognition: Different from traditional image-to-image recognition, set-to-set recognition takes a set (heterogeneous contents containing both images and videos) as the smallest unit of representation. This kind of setting does reflect the real-world biometric scenarios, thereby attracting a lot of attention. After learning face representations of media in each set, two strategies are generally adopted to perform set-to-set matching. One is to use these representations to perform pair-wise similarity comparison of two sets and aggregate the results into a single and final score by max score pooling [96], average score pooling [252] and its variations [253], [254]. The other strategy is feature pooling [96], [103], [81] which first aggregates face representations into a single representation for each set and then performs a comparison between two sets. In addition to the commonly used strategies, there are also some novel methods proposed for set/template-based FR. For example, Hayat et al. [255] proposed a deep heterogeneous feature fusion network to exploit the features’ complementary information generated by different CNNs. Liu et al. [256] introduced the actor-critic reinforcement learning for set-based FR. They casted the inner-set dependency modeling to a Markov decision process in the latent space, and trained a dependency-aware attention control agent to make attention control for each image in each step. 3) Video Face Recognition: There are two key issues in video FR: one is to integrate the information across different frames together to build a representation of the video face, and the other is to handle video frames with severe blur, pose variations, and occlusions. For frame aggregation, Yang et al. [83] proposed a neural aggregation network (NAN) in which the aggregation module, consisting of two attention blocks driven by a memory, produces a 128-dimensional vector representation (Fig. 26). Rao et al. [187] aggregated raw video frames directly by combining the idea of metric learning and adversarial learning. For dealing with bad frames, Rao et al. [185] discarded the bad frames by treating this operation as a Markov decision process and trained the attention model through a deep reinforcement learning framework. Ding et al. [257] artificially blurred clear images for training to learn blur-robust face representations. Parchami et al. [258] used a CNN to reconstruct a lower-quality video into a high-quality face. 1) 3D Face Recognition: 3D FR has inherent advantages over 2D methods, but 3D deep FR is not well developed due to the lack of large annotated 3D data. To enlarge 3D training datasets, most works use the methods of “one-to-many augmentation” to synthesize 3D faces. However, the effective methods for extracting deep features of 3D faces remain to be explored. Kim et al. [204] fine-tuned a 2D CNN with a small amount of 3D scans for 3D FR. Zulqarnain et al. [259] used a three-channel (corresponding to depth, azimuth and elevation angles of the normal vector) image as input and minimized the average prediction log-loss. Zhang et al. [260] first selected 30 feature points from the Candide-3 face model to characterize aces, then conducted the unsupervised pretraining of face depth data, and finally performed the supervised fine-tuning. 2) Partial Face Recognition: Partial FR, in which only arbitrary-size face patches are presented, has become an emerging problem with increasing requirements of identification from CCTV cameras and embedded vision systems in mobile devices, robots and smart home facilities. He et al. [261] divided the aligned face image into several multi-scale patches, and the dissimilarity between two partial face images is calculated as the weighted L2 distance between corresponding patches. Dynamic feature matching (DFM) [262] utilized a sliding window of the same size as the probe feature maps to decompose the gallery feature maps into several gallery sub-feature maps, and the similarity-guided constraint imposed on sparse representation classification (SRC) provides an alignment-free matching. 4) Face Anti-attack: With the success of FR techniques, various types of attacks, such as face spoofing and adversarial perturbations, are becoming large threats. Face spoofing involves presenting a fake face to the biometric sensor using a printed photograph, worn mask, or even an image displayed on another electronic device. In order to defense this type of attack, several methods are proposed [211], [273], [274], [275], [276], [277], [278], [279]. Atoum et al. [211] proposed a novel two-stream CNN in which the local features discriminate the spoof patches that are independent of the spatial face areas, and holistic depth maps ensure that the input live sample has a face-like depth. Yang et al. [273] trained a CNN using both a single frame and multiple frames with five scales as input, and using the live/spoof label as the output. Taken the sequence of video frames as input, Xu et al. [274] applied LSTM units on top of CNN to obtain end-to-end features to recognize spoofing faces which leveraged the local and dense property from convolution operation and learned the temporal structure using LSTM units. Li et al. [275] and Patel et al. [276] fine-tuned their networks from a pretrained model by training sets of real and fake images. Jourabloo et al. [277] proposed to inversely decompose a spoof face into the live face and the spoof noise pattern. Adversarial perturbation is the other type of attack which can be defined as the addition of a minimal vector r such that with addition of this vector into the input image x, i.e. (x + r), the deep learning models misclassifies the input while people will not. Recently, more and more work has begun to focus on solving this perturbation of FR. Goswami et al. [280] proposed to detect adversarial samples by characterizing abnormal filter response behavior in the hidden layers and increase the network’s robustness by removing the most problematic filters. Goel et al. [281] provided an open source implementation of adversarial detection and mitigation algorithms. Despite of progresses of anti-attack algorithms, attack methods are updated as well and remind us the need to further increase security and robustness in FR systems, for example, Mai et al. [282] proposed a neighborly deconvolutional neural network (NbNet) to reconstruct a fake face using the stolen deep templates. 5) Debiasing face recognition: As described in Section V-A, existing datasets are highly biased in terms of the distribution of demographic cohorts, which may dramatically impact the fairness of deep models. To address this issue, there are some works that seek to introduce fairness into face recognition and mitigate demographic bias, e,g. unbalanced-training [283], attribute removal [284], [285], [286] and domain adaptation [173], [287], [147]. 1) Unbalanced-training methods mitigate the bias via model regularization, taking into consideration of the fairness goal in the overall model objective function. For example, RL-RBN [283] formulated the process of finding the optimal margins for non-Caucasians as a Markov decision process and employed deep Q-learning to learn policies based on large margin loss. 2) Attribute removal methods confound or remove demographic information of faces to learn attribute-invariant representations. For example, Alvi et al. [284] applied a confusion loss to make a classifier fail to distinguish attributes of examples so that multiple spurious variations are removed from the feature representation. SensitiveNets [288] proposed to introduce sensitive information into triplet loss. They minimized the sensitive information, while maintaining distances between positive and negative embeddings. 3) Domain adaptation methods propose to investigate data bias problem from a domain adaptation point of view and attempt to design domain-invariant feature representations to mitigate bias across domains. IMAN [173] simultaneously aligned global distribution to decrease race gap at domain-level, and learned the discriminative target representations at cluster level. Kan [147] directly converted the Caucasian data to non-Caucasian domain in the image space with the help of sparse reconstruction coefficients learnt in the common subspace."
Is the segmented training data 2d or 3d ?,3D,V-Net is trained on the 3D MRI prostate volumes.,"Segmentation is a highly relevant task in medical image analysis.Automatic delineation of organs and structures of interest is often necessary to perform tasks such as visual augmentation [10], computer assisted diagnosis [12], interventions [20] and extraction of quantitative indices from images [1].In particular, since diagnostic and interventional imagery often consists of 3D images, being able to perform volumetric segmentations by taking into account the whole volume content at once, has a particular relevance.In this work, we aim to segment prostate MRI volumes. This is a challenging task due to the wide range of appearance the prostate can assume in different scans due to deformations and variations of the intensity distribution. Moreover, MRI volumes are often affected by artefacts and distortions due to field inhomogeneity. Prostate segmentation is nevertheless an important task having clinical relevance both during diagnosis, where the volume of the prostate needs to be assessed [13], and during treatment planning, where the estimate of the anatomical boundary needs to be accurate [4, 20]. Our CNN is trained end-to-end on a dataset of prostate scans in MRI. An example of the typical content of such volumes is shown in Figure 1. All the volumes processed by the network have fixed size of 128\times 128\times 64 voxels and a spatial resolution of 1\times 1\times 1.5 millimeters. We trained our method on 50 MRI volumes, and the relative manual ground truth annotation, obtained from the ”PROMISE2012” challenge dataset [7]. This dataset contains medical data acquired in different hospitals, using different equipment and different acquisition protocols. The data in this dataset is representative of the clinical variability and challenges encountered in clinical settings. As previously stated we massively augmented this dataset through random transformation performed in each training iteration, for each mini-batch fed to the network. The mini-batches used in our implementation contained two volumes each, mainly due to the high memory requirement of the model during training. We used a momentum of 0.99 and a initial learning rate of 0.0001 which decreases by one order of magnitude every 25K iterations. We tested V-Net on 30 MRI volumes depicting prostate whose ground truth annotation was secret. All the results reported in this section of the paper were obtained directly from the organisers of the challenge after submitting the segmentation obtained through our approach. The test set was representative of the clinical variability encountered in prostate scans in real clinical settings [7]. We presented and approach based on a volumetric convolutional neural network that performs segmentation of MRI prostate volumes in a fast and accurate manner. We introduced a novel objective function that we optimise during training based on the Dice overlap coefficient between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth annotation. Our Dice loss layer does not need sample re-weighting when the amount of background and foreground pixels is strongly unbalanced and is indicated for binary segmentation tasks. Although we inspired our architecture to the one proposed in [14], we divided it into stages that learn residuals and, as empirically observed, improve both results and convergence time. Future works will aim at segmenting volumes containing multiple regions in other modalities such as ultrasound and at higher resolutions by splitting the network over multiple GPUs. Fully convolutional network trained end-to-end were so far applied only to 2D images both in computer vision [11, 8] and microscopy image analysis [14]. These models, which served as an inspiration for our work, employed different network architectures and were trained to predict a segmentation mask, delineating the structures of interest, for the whole image. In [11] a pre-trained VGG network architecture [15] was used in conjunction with its mirrored, de-convolutional, equivalent to segment RGB images by leveraging the descriptive power of the features extracted by the innermost layer. In [8] three fully convolutional deep neural networks, pre-trained on a classification task, were refined to produce segmentations while in [14] a brand new CNN model, especially tailored to tackle biomedical image analysis problems in 2D, was proposed. In this work we present our approach to medical image segmentation that leverages the power of a fully convolutional neural networks, trained end-to-end, to process MRI volumes.Differently from other recent approaches we refrain from processing the input volumes slice-wise and we propose to use volumetric convolutions instead. We propose a novel objective function based on Dice coefficient maximisation, that we optimise during training.We demonstrate fast and accurate results on prostate MRI test volumes and we provide direct comparison with other methods which were evaluated on the same test data 111Detailed results available on http://promise12.grand-challenge.org/results/."
What is the difference between foreground and background voxels?,"Foreground voxels have a higher probability (>0.5) to belong to the anatomy than to the background, while background voxels have a higher probability to belong to the background than to the foreground",At the output of the V-Net foreground voxels represents the score for the anatomy and background voxels represents score for not having the anatomy at a region.,"The right portion of the network extracts features and expands the spatial support of the lower resolution feature maps in order to gather and assemble the necessary information to output a two channel volumetric segmentation. The two features maps computed by the very last convolutional layer, having 1\times 1\times 1 kernel size and producing outputs of the same size as the input volume, are converted to probabilistic segmentations of the foreground and background regions by applying soft-max voxelwise.After each stage of the right portion of the CNN, a de-convolution operation is employed in order increase the size of the inputs (Figure 3) followed by one to three convolutional layers involving half the number of 5\times 5\times 5 kernels employed in the previous layer. Similar to the left part of the network, also in this case we resort to learn residual functions in the convolutional stages. We report in Table 1 the receptive fields of each network layer, showing the fact that the innermost portion of our CNN already captures the content of the whole input volume. We believe that this characteristic is important during segmentation of poorly visible anatomy: the features computed in the deepest layer perceive the whole anatomy of interest at once, since they are computed from data having a spatial support much larger than the typical size of the anatomy we seek to delineate, and therefore impose global constraints. The network predictions, which consist of two volumes having the same resolution as the original input data, are processed through a soft-max layer which outputs the probability of each voxel to belong to foreground and to background. In medical volumes such as the ones we are processing in this work, it is not uncommon that the anatomy of interest occupies only a very small region of the scan. This often causes the learning process to get trapped in local minima of the loss function yielding a network whose predictions are strongly biased towards background. As a result the foreground region is often missing or only partially detected. Several previous approaches resorted to loss functions based on sample re-weighting where foreground regions are given more importance than background ones during learning. In this work we propose a novel objective function based on dice coefficient, which is a quantity ranging between 0 and 1 which we aim to maximise. The dice coefficient D between two binary volumes can be written asD=\frac{2\sum_{i}^{N}p_{i}g_{i}}{\sum_{i}^{N}p_{i}^{2}+\sum_{i}^{N}g_{i}^{2}} A Previously unseen MRI volume can be segmented by processing it in a feed-forward manner through the network. The output of the last convolutional layer, after soft-max, consists of a probability map for background and foreground. The voxels having higher probability (>0.5) to belong to the foreground than to the background are considered part of the anatomy.

Does it have anything to do with the nature and complexity of data we are working with ?,"Yes. The fact that the innermost portion of the CNN already captures the content of the whole input volume, and the need to augment the original training dataset to obtain robustness and increased precision, are both related to the nature and complexity of the data being worked with",In general MRI 3D volume data is complex. Prostate anomaly segmentation also makes the data in consideration unique.,"We report in Table 1 the receptive fields of each network layer, showing the fact that the innermost portion of our CNN already captures the content of the whole input volume. We believe that this characteristic is important during segmentation of poorly visible anatomy: the features computed in the deepest layer perceive the whole anatomy of interest at once, since they are computed from data having a spatial support much larger than the typical size of the anatomy we seek to delineate, and therefore impose global constraints.

All the volumes processed by the network have fixed size of 128\times 128\times 64 voxels and a spatial resolution of 1\times 1\times 1.5 millimeters. Annotated medical volumes are not easy to obtain due to the fact that one or more experts are required to manually trace a reliable ground truth annotation and that there is a cost associated with their acquisition. In this work we found necessary to augment the original training dataset in order to obtain robustness and increased precision on the test dataset. We tested V-Net on 30 MRI volumes depicting prostate whose ground truth annotation was secret.

"Going deep through network layers makes it harder to remember shallower local information, wouldn't that make segmentation harder?","No.

Despite going deeper through network layers, the features computed in the deepest layers capture global information while still leveraging the local information captured by shallower layers. The increasing receptive fields of the network layers allow the network to capture both local and global information, which is important for accurate segmentation of poorly visible anatomy",Since non anatomy part has a much larger spatial support than the anatomy and As we move down the layers in a CNN the receptive field of the features increases therefore proposed CNN would work fine for the local information.,"Recent research in computer vision and pattern recognition has highlighted the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve challenging tasks such as classification, segmentation and object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performances.This success has been attributed to the ability of CNNs to learn a hierarchical representation of raw input data, without relying on handcrafted features.As the inputs are processed through the network layers, the level of abstraction of the resulting features increases.Shallower layers grasp local information while deeper layers use filters whose receptive fields are much broader that therefore capture global information [19].

CNNs have been recently used for medical image segmentation.Early approaches obtain anatomy delineation in images or volumes by performing patch-wise image classification. Such segmentations are obtained by only considering local context and therefore are prone to failure, especially in challenging modalities such as ultrasound, where a high number of mis-classified voxel are to be expected.Post-processing approaches such as connected components analysis normally yield no improvement and therefore, more recent works, propose to use the network predictions in combination with Markov random fields [6], voting strategies [9] or more traditional approaches such as level-sets [2].Patch-wise approaches also suffer from efficiency issues. When densely extracted patches are processed in a CNN, a high number of computations is redundant and therefore the total algorithm runtime is high. In this case, more efficient computational schemes can be adopted. Downsampling allows us to reduce the size of the signal presented as input and to increase the receptive field of the features being computed in subsequent network layers. Each of the stages of the left part of the network, computes a number of features which is two times higher than the one of the previous layer."
Why it is needed to have a two channel volumetric segmentation in the output?,To output a two-channel volumetric segmentation is necessary to distinguish between foreground and background regions in the prostate MRI volumes,Two channel volumetric segmentation is used at the output to perform binary classification of foreground and background classes using soft-max. Each volume represent the logits for each class at each pixel location.,"Segmentation is a highly relevant task in medical image analysis.Automatic delineation of organs and structures of interest is often necessary to perform tasks such as visual augmentation [10], computer assisted diagnosis [12], interventions [20] and extraction of quantitative indices from images [1].In particular, since diagnostic and interventional imagery often consists of 3D images, being able to perform volumetric segmentations by taking into account the whole volume content at once, has a particular relevance.In this work, we aim to segment prostate MRI volumes.

"Is the increase in receptive field of the features being computed in subsequent network layers due to the downsampling mentioned by the authors, or is it the result of subsequent convolutions as the network goes deeper?","Both.

The increase in receptive field of the features being computed in subsequent network layers is due to both downsampling and subsequent convolutions as the network goes deeper. Downsampling allows the network to capture a larger receptive field, while subsequent convolutions with larger kernels further increase the receptive field",The increase in receptive field of the features being computed in subsequent network layers is the result of convolutions layers as the network goes deeper?,"Recent research in computer vision and pattern recognition has highlighted the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve challenging tasks such as classification, segmentation and object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performances.This success has been attributed to the ability of CNNs to learn a hierarchical representation of raw input data, without relying on handcrafted features.As the inputs are processed through the network layers, the level of abstraction of the resulting features increases.Shallower layers grasp local information while deeper layers use filters whose receptive fields are much broader that therefore capture global information [19].

In Figure 2 we provide a schematic representation of our convolutional neural network.We perform convolutions aiming to both extract features from the data and, at the end of each stage, to reduce its resolution by using appropriate stride. The left part of the network consists of a compression path, while the right part decompresses the signal until its original size is reached. Convolutions are all applied with appropriate padding. The convolutions performed in each stage use volumetric kernels having size 5\times 5\times 5 voxels.As the data proceeds through different stages along the compression path, its resolution is reduced. This is performed through convolution with 2\times 2\times 2 voxels wide kernels applied with stride 2 (Figure 3). Since the second operation extracts features by considering only non overlapping 2\times 2\times 2 volume patches, the size of the resulting feature maps is halved.This strategy serves a similar purpose as pooling layers that, motivated by [16] and other works discouraging the use of max-pooling operations in CNNs, have been replaced in our approach by convolutional ones. Moreover, since the number of feature channels doubles at each stage of the compression path of the V-Net, and due to the formulation of the model as a residual network, we resort to these convolution operations to double the number of feature maps as we reduce their resolution. PReLu non linearities are applied throughout the network. Downsampling allows us to reduce the size of the signal presented as input and to increase the receptive field of the features being computed in subsequent network layers. Each of the stages of the left part of the network, computes a number of features which is two times higher than the one of the previous layer."

During every training iteration, we fed as input to the network randomly deformed versions of the training images by using a dense deformation field obtained through a 2\times 2\times 2 grid of control-points and B-spline interpolation. This augmentation has been performed ”on-the-fly”, prior to each optimisation iteration, in order to alleviate the otherwise excessive storage requirements. Additionally we vary the intensity distribution of the data by adapting, using histogram matching, the intensity distributions of the training volumes used in each iteration, to the ones of other randomly chosen scans belonging to the dataset.

What is meant by the author saying that replacing pooling layers with convolutional layers reduces the memory footprint during training? ,"The author means that replacing pooling layers with convolutional layers reduces the amount of memory needed for training, because no switches are required to map the output of the pooling layers back to their inputs for backpropagation","Replacement of pooling layers with convolution layers resulted in smaller memory footprint due to the fact that there is no need to map the output of pooling layers back to their inputs during back-propagation step of training,","Replacing pooling operations with convolutional ones results also to networks that, depending on the specific implementation, can have a smaller memory footprint during training, due to the fact that no switches mapping the output of pooling layers back to their inputs are needed for back-propagation, and that can be better understood and analysed [19] by applying only de-convolutions instead of un-pooling operations."
Does deconvolution and unpooling conduct the same goal in the network?,"No.

Deconvolution and unpooling serve different purposes in the network. Deconvolution increases the size of the input, while unpooling reduces the size of the input by downsampling",Yes the purpose of the de-convolution layer is to increase the size similar to un-pooling operation.,"The right portion of the network extracts features and expands the spatial support of the lower resolution feature maps in order to gather and assemble the necessary information to output a two channel volumetric segmentation.

Does using horizontal connections depend on the amount and complexity of the data wanted to be segmented?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

NO.

Using horizontal connections does not depend on the amount and complexity of the data wanted to be segmented","Yes, more complex data can be finely segmented by using horizontal connections in the CNN network.","Similarly to [14], we forward the features extracted from early stages of the left part of the CNN to the right part. This is schematically represented in Figure 2 by horizontal connections. In this way we gather fine grained detail that would be otherwise lost in the compression path and we improve the quality of the final contour prediction. We also observed that when these connections improve the convergence time of the model."
"Does the phrase ""data with larger spatial support than the typical size of the anatomy"" refer to feature maps with a larger number of channels than the input map at the deepest layer, or does it refer to something else?","No, the phrase ""data with larger spatial support than the typical size of the anatomy"" does not refer to feature maps with a larger number of channels than the input map at the deepest layer. Instead, it refers to the fact that the features computed in the deepest layer are computed from data that has a larger spatial support than the typical size of the anatomy being segmented, which imposes global constraints on the segmentation",Yes the phrase refer to feature maps with a larger number of channels than the input map at the deepest layer. As we move deeper the network will capture more features..,"We report in Table 1 the receptive fields of each network layer, showing the fact that the innermost portion of our CNN already captures the content of the whole input volume. We believe that this characteristic is important during segmentation of poorly visible anatomy: the features computed in the deepest layer perceive the whole anatomy of interest at once, since they are computed from data having a spatial support much larger than the typical size of the anatomy we seek to delineate, and therefore impose global constraints."
"Does performing augmentation ""on-the-fly"" prior to each optimization iteration slow down the learning process?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

NO.

Performing augmentation ""on-the-fly"" prior to each optimization iteration does not slow down the learning process, as the deformation field is obtained through a 2x2x2 grid of control points and B-spline interpolation, which is a fast and efficient process",On the fly data augmentation will decrease the storage requirements and will increase the speed of each training iteration.,"During every training iteration, we fed as input to the network randomly deformed versions of the training images by using a dense deformation field obtained through a 2\times 2\times 2 grid of control-points and B-spline interpolation. This augmentation has been performed ”on-the-fly”, prior to each optimisation iteration, in order to alleviate the otherwise excessive storage requirements. Additionally we vary the intensity distribution of the data by adapting, using histogram matching, the intensity distributions of the training volumes used in each iteration, to the ones of other randomly chosen scans belonging to the dataset."
Is the v-net model used in other medical tasks or on another MRI data as a pretrained model? What are the results? ,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

No, the V-Net model was not used in other medical tasks or on another MRI data as a pretrained model. The model was specifically designed and trained for prostate segmentation on the MRI data provided in the challenge","Yes V-Net is tested as a pretrained model on 30 MRI volumes for which ground truth segmentation was hidden,",We tested V-Net on 30 MRI volumes depicting prostate whose ground truth annotation was secret. All the results reported in this section of the paper were obtained directly from the organisers of the challenge after submitting the segmentation obtained through our approach. The test set was representative of the clinical variability encountered in prostate scans in real clinical settings [7].
Are the comparisons provided for the task enough to replace the consultant or doctor in such a critical field?,No,Keeping in view the cost and expert requirements the doctors can only be replaced if the V-Net can be trained on sufficiently large dataset annotated by experts,Annotated medical volumes are not easy to obtain due to the fact that one or more experts are required to manually trace a reliable ground truth annotation and that there is a cost associated with their acquisition. In this work we found necessary to augment the original training dataset in order to obtain robustness and increased precision on the test dataset.
What is volumetric neural network?,"A volumetric neural network is a type of neural network that processes and analyzes 3D data, such as medical imaging volumes, in a spatially consistent manner",A volumetric neural network works on the input of 3D volumes and uses 3D convolution filters.,"We presented and approach based on a volumetric convolutional neural network that performs segmentation of MRI prostate volumes in a fast and accurate manner. We introduced a novel objective function that we optimise during training based on the Dice overlap coefficient between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth annotation. Our Dice loss layer does not need sample re-weighting when the amount of background and foreground pixels is strongly unbalanced and is indicated for binary segmentation tasks. Although we inspired our architecture to the one proposed in [14], we divided it into stages that learn residuals and, as empirically observed, improve both results and convergence time. Future works will aim at segmenting volumes containing multiple regions in other modalities such as ultrasound and at higher resolutions by splitting the network over multiple GPUs."
"What are differences between  “warping error”, the “Rand error” and the “pixel error” ?","The ""warping error"" measures the difference between the predicted and ground truth shapes, while the ""Rand error"" measures the difference between the predicted and ground truth pixel values. The ""pixel error"" is a measure of the difference between the predicted and ground truth pixel values, but it is not normalized by the number of pixels.

In other words, the warping error focuses on the shape of the predicted image, while the Rand error and pixel error focus on the pixel values","If both queries and documents are short, fine-granular interaction is not required. : it uses BERT to produce a single embedding vector for the query and another for the document, extracted from BERT’s [CLS] contextualized embedding and expanded through a linear layer to dimension 4096 (which equals N_{q}\times 128=32\times 128). Relevance is estimated as the inner product of the query’s and the document’s embeddings, which we found to perform better than cosine similarity for single-vector re-ranking.","The u-net (averaged over 7 rotated versions of the input data) achieves without any further pre- or postprocessing a warping error of 0.0003529 (the new best score, see Table 1) and a rand-error of 0.0382."
Is Data Augmentation always sufficient to support performance in the segmentation task? ,"No. While data augmentation can be highly effective in improving the performance of a segmentation network, it is not always sufficient to support good performance. Other factors, such as the quality and quantity of the training data, the network architecture, and the specific task requirements, also play a crucial role in determining the performance of the segmentation model",Performance of microscopy image segmentation task can be improved by using elastic deformation based segmentation.,"Data augmentation is essential to teach the network the desired invariance and robustness properties, when only few training samples are available. In case of microscopical images we primarily need shift and rotation invariance as well as robustness to deformations and gray value variations. Especially random elastic deformations of the training samples seem to be the key concept to train a segmentation network with very few annotated images.We generate smooth deformations using random displacement vectors on a coarse 3 by 3 grid. The displacements are sampled from a Gaussian distribution with 10 pixels standard deviation. Per-pixel displacements are then computed using bicubic interpolation. Drop-out layers at the end of the contracting path perform further implicit data augmentation. The u-net architecture achieves very good performance on very different biomedical segmentation applications. Thanks to data augmentation with elastic deformations, it only needs very few annotated images and has a very reasonable training time of only 10 hours on a NVidia Titan GPU (6 GB).We provide the full Caffe[6]-based implementation and the trained networks444U-net implementation, trained networks and supplementary material available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net. We are sure that the u-net architecture can be applied easily to many more tasks. As for our tasks there is very little training data available, we use excessive data augmentation by applying elastic deformations to the available training images. This allows the network to learn invariance to such deformations, without the need to see these transformations in the annotated image corpus. This is particularly important in biomedical segmentation, since deformation used to be the most common variation in tissue and realistic deformations can be simulated efficiently. The value of data augmentation for learning invariance has been shown in Dosovitskiy et al. [2] in the scope of unsupervised feature learning."
Is fast processing the only metric that we consider in segmentation?,No,"Other than the processing time, performance of the segmentation task is also measure by computing the warping error, Rand error and the pixel error from thresholded segmentation map and also by IOU metric.","We demonstrate the application of the u-net to three different segmentation tasks. The first task is the segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic recordings. An example of the data set and our obtained segmentation is displayed in Figure 2. We provide the full result as Supplementary Material. The data set is provided by the EM segmentation challenge [14] that was started at ISBI 2012 and is still open for new contributions. The training data is a set of 30 images (512x512 pixels) from serial section transmission electron microscopy of the Drosophila first instar larva ventral nerve cord (VNC). Each image comes with a corresponding fully annotated ground truth segmentation map for cells (white) and membranes (black). The test set is publicly available, but its segmentation maps are kept secret. An evaluation can be obtained by sending the predicted membrane probability map to the organizers. The evaluation is done by thresholding the map at 10 different levels and computation of the “warping error”, the “Rand error” and the “pixel error” [14]. Here we achieve an average IOU (“intersection over union”) of 92%, which is significantly better than the second best algorithm with 83% (see Table 2)."
Can we try to re-generate those unreachable images using recent methods to enhance medical tasks?,"Yes, recent methods can be used to re-generate unreachable images for medical tasks",unreachable images can be generated by using elastic deformation based augmentation methods.,"Data augmentation is essential to teach the network the desired invariance and robustness properties, when only few training samples are available.

Do Ciresan et al. treat each patch as a separated input in their previous approach in segmentation?,Yes,Yes Ciresan et al approach treated segmentation of each patch differently.,"The typical use of convolutional networks is on classification tasks, where the output to an image is a single class label. However, in many visual tasks, especially in biomedical image processing, the desired output should include localization, i.e., a class label is supposed to be assigned to each pixel. Moreover, thousands of training images are usually beyond reach in biomedical tasks. Hence, Ciresan et al. [1] trained a network in a sliding-window setup to predict the class label of each pixel by providing a local region (patch) around that pixel as input. First, this network can localize. Secondly, the training data in terms of patches is much larger than the number of training images. The resulting network won the EM segmentation challenge at ISBI 2012 by a large margin. Obviously, the strategy in Ciresan et al. [1] has two drawbacks. First, it is quite slow because the network must be run separately for each patch, and there is a lot of redundancy due to overlapping patches.Secondly, there is a trade-off between localization accuracy and the use of context. Larger patches require more max-pooling layers that reduce the localization accuracy, while small patches allow the network to see only little context. More recent approaches [11, 4] proposed a classifier output that takes into account the features from multiple layers. Good localization and the use of context are possible at the same time."
Why does using larger patches reduce localization accuracy?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Using larger patches reduces localization accuracy because it requires more max-pooling layers, which can reduce the localization accuracy",Larger patches reduce localization accuracy because they require more max-pooling layers.,"Obviously, the strategy in Ciresan et al. [1] has two drawbacks.

What would happen to the model performance if we just use connections from earlier layers of contracting path while going deeper without upsampling to perform localization?,The model performance would degrade,Model need to match the size of expansion path with the contacting path at each stage. Otherwise the localization performance would suffer.,"In this paper, we build upon a more elegant architecture, the so-called “fully convolutional network” [9]. We modify and extend this architecture such that it works with very few training images and yields more precise segmentations; see Figure 1. The main idea in [9] is to supplement a usual contracting network by successive layers, where pooling operators are replaced by upsampling operators. Hence, these layers increase the resolution of the output. In order to localize, high resolution features from the contracting path are combined with the upsampled output. A successive convolution layer can then learn to assemble a more precise output based on this information. One important modification in our architecture is that in the upsampling part we have also a large number of feature channels, which allow the network to propagate context information to higher resolution layers. As a consequence, the expansive path is more or less symmetric to the contracting path, and yields a u-shaped architecture. The network does not have any fully connected layers and only uses the valid part of each convolution, i.e., the segmentation map only contains the pixels, for which the full context is available in the input image. This strategy allows the seamless segmentation of arbitrarily large images by an overlap-tile strategy (see Figure 2). To predict the pixels in the border region of the image, the missing context is extrapolated by mirroring the input image. This tiling strategy is important to apply the network to large images, since otherwise the resolution would be limited by the GPU memory."

Is convolution and up-convolution considered as the transform and its inverse?,"Yes. Convolution and up-convolution are considered as the transform and its inverse, respectively",Ye up-convolution operation upsamples the feature resolution back to original and also reduces the number of feature channels.,"The network architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. It consists of a contracting path (left side) and an expansive path (right side). The contracting path follows the typical architecture of a convolutional network. It consists of the repeated application of two 3x3 convolutions (unpadded convolutions), each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a 2x2 max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling. At each downsampling step we double the number of feature channels. Every step in the expansive path consists of an upsampling of the feature map followed by a 2x2 convolution (“up-convolution”) that halves the number of feature channels, a concatenation with the correspondingly cropped feature map from the contracting path, and two 3x3 convolutions, each followed by a ReLU. The cropping is necessary due to the loss of border pixels in every convolution. At the final layer a 1x1 convolution is used to map each 64-component feature vector to the desired number of classes.

Which gives better performance: using more than one image in the batch or larger input tiles with only one image in the batch ?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Using larger input tiles with only one image in the batch gives better performance",According to the experiments in the paper use of large tiles instead of large size is preferred which reduces the overhead and maximize the use of GPU memory.,"The input images and their corresponding segmentation maps are used to train the network with the stochastic gradient descent implementation of Caffe [6].Due to the unpadded convolutions, the output image is smaller than the input by a constant border width. To minimize the overhead and make maximum use of the GPU memory, we favor large input tiles over a large batch size and hence reduce the batch to a single image. Accordingly we use a high momentum (0.99) such that a large number of the previously seen training samples determine the update in the current optimization step."

"Is it correct that The separation border equation for a cell is meant majorly by critical nearer cells and classes and when these cells become more and more distant in the map, the boarder equation goes to the weight assigned to this class ?","Yes. The separation border equation is primarily determined by critical nearer cells and classes, and the weight assigned to this class decreases as the cells become more distant in the map",Yes the loss function can handle the changes in distance between the cell.,"Another challenge in many cell segmentation tasks is the separation of touching objects of the same class; see Figure 3.

What performance metric does IOU measure?,Intersection over Union (IoU) measures the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth box,The IOU measures the overlap between the ground-truth RoI and the RoI detected by the model.,"With pre-computed region proposals, it is easy to end-to-end train the R-FCN architecture. Following [6], our loss function defined on each RoI is the summation of the cross-entropy loss and the box regression loss: L(s,t(x,y,w,h)) = Lcls(sc∗ ) + λ[c∗ > 0]Lreg(t, t∗). Here c∗ is the RoI’s ground-truth label (c∗ = 0 means background). Lcls(sc∗ ) = − log(sc∗) is the cross-entropy loss for classification, Lreg is the bounding box regression loss as defined in [6], and t∗ represents the ground truth box. [c∗ > 0] is an indicator which equals to 1 if the argument is true and 0 otherwise. We set the balance weight λ = 1 as in [6]. We define positive examples as the RoIs that have intersection-over-union (IoU) overlap with a ground-truth box of at least 0.5, and negative otherwise."
Is Faster R-CNN +++ another different architecture or just some refinement for the known models?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Faster R-CNN +++ is a refinement of the known models, not a different architecture","Faster R-CNN+++ is a refined model of Faster R-CNN. Faster R-CNN+++ uses iterative box regression, context and multi-scale training to refine the original model.","Table 5 shows more comparisons. Following the multi-scale training in [8], we resize the image in each training iteration such that the scale is randomly sampled from {400,500,600,700,800} pixels. We still test a single scale of 600 pixels, so add no test-time cost. The mAP is 80.5%. In addition, we train our model on the MS COCO [13] trainval set and then fine-tune it on the PASCAL VOC set. R-FCN achieves 83.6% mAP (Table 5), close to the “Faster R-CNN +++” system in [9] that uses ResNet-101 as well. We note that our competitive result is obtained at a test speed of 0.17 seconds per image, 20\times faster than Faster R-CNN +++ that takes 3.36 seconds as it further incorporates iterative box regression, context, and multi-scale testing [9].These comparisons are also observed on the PASCAL VOC 2012 test set (Table 5)."
Why was R-FCN unable to converge using only one score map?,R-FCN was unable to converge using only one score map because it lacks the ability to capture spatial information,"R-FCN depends on the score maps of R-FCN for its output as the score maps are used for the rod pooling layer. Therefore, when the k = 1 and there is only one score map, RoIs don't actually capture any spatial information and therefore the model fails to learn the task.","In this paper, we develop a framework called Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) for object detection. Our network consists of shared, fully convolutional architectures as is the case of FCN [15]. To incorporate translation variance into FCN, we construct a set of position-sensitive score maps by using a bank of specialized convolutional layers as the FCN output. Each of these score maps encodes the position information with respect to a relative spatial position (e.g., “to the left of an object”). On top of this FCN, we append a position-sensitive RoI pooling layer that shepherds information from these score maps, with no weight (convolutional/fc) layers following. The entire architecture is learned end-to-end. All learnable layers are convolutional and shared on the entire image, yet encode spatial information required for object detection. Figure 1 illustrates the key idea and Table 1 compares the methodologies among region-based detectors. The importance of position-sensitivity is further demonstrated by setting k=1, for which R-FCN is unable to converge. In this degraded case, no spatial information can be explicitly captured within an RoI. Moreover, we report that naïve Faster R-CNN is able to converge if its RoI pooling output resolution is 1\times 1, but the mAP further drops by a large margin to 61.7% (Table 2). Given the proposal regions (RoIs), the R-FCN architecture is designed to classify the RoIs into object categories and background. In R-FCN, all learnable weight layers are convolutional and are computed on the entire image. The last convolutional layer produces a bank of k^{2} position-sensitive score maps for each category, and thus has a k^{2}(C+1)-channel output layer with C object categories (+1 for background). The bank of k^{2} score maps correspond to a k\times k spatial grid describing relative positions. For example, with k\times k=3\times 3, the 9 score maps encode the cases of {top-left, top-center, top-right, …, bottom-right} of an object category."
What was Faster R-CNN developed to overcome in the Fast R-CNN?,Faster R-CNN was developed to overcome the computational cost of the sliding window approach used in Fast R-CNN,"Faster R-CNN uses a RPN component to predict bounding boxes of objects it detects instead of sliding windows, which is what Fast R-CNN uses. From the names of the two models, it can be inferred that the change in methodology allowed Faster R-CNN to be more computationally efficient while still performing well.","There have been object detectors that can be thought of as “fully convolutional” models. OverFeat [21] detects objects by sliding multi-scale windows on the shared convolutional feature maps; similarly, in Fast R-CNN [6] and [12], sliding windows that replace region proposals are investigated. In these cases, one can recast a sliding window of a single scale as a single convolutional layer. The RPN component in Faster R-CNN [18] is a fully convolutional detector that predicts bounding boxes with respect to reference boxes (anchors) of multiple sizes. The original RPN is class-agnostic in [18], but its class-specific counterpart is applicable (see also [14]) as we evaluate in the following."
What is the hole algorithm?,"The hole algorithm, also known as the ""à trous"" trick, is a technique used to compensate for the reduced stride in the convolutional layers of a neural network, specifically in the conv5 stage, by adding additional filters to fill in the ""holes"" created by the reduced stride",The authors do not explain exactly what the hole algorithm is. It is implied that the hole algorithm is a trick that is used to try to improve performance by changing the stride and filters of convolutional layers.,"À trous and stride. Our fully convolutional architecture enjoys the benefits of the network modifications that are widely used by FCNs for semantic segmentation [15, 2]. Particularly, we reduce ResNet-101’s effective stride from 32 pixels to 16 pixels, increasing the score map resolution. All layers before and on the conv4 stage [9] (stride=16) are unchanged; the stride=2 operations in the first conv5 block is modified to have stride=1, and all convolutional filters on the conv5 stage are modified by the “hole algorithm” [15, 2] (“Algorithme à trous” [16]) to compensate for the reduced stride. For fair comparisons, the RPN is computed on top of the conv4 stage (that are shared with R-FCN), as is the case in [9] with Faster R-CNN, so the RPN is not affected by the à trous trick.

"What does ""non-maximum suppression"" mean?","Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is a technique used to reduce the number of proposed bounding boxes (RoIs) after the RPN and R-FCN inference stages, by discarding boxes that do not have the highest confidence score within a given threshold (in this case, 0.3 IoU)",The authors do not explain exactly what non-maximum suppression is. It is implied that it is a common post-processing method that culls RoIs that have low IoU scores.,"Inference. As illustrated in Figure 2, the feature maps shared between RPN and R-FCN are computed (on an image with a single scale of 600). Then the RPN part proposes RoIs, on which the R-FCN part evaluates category-wise scores and regresses bounding boxes.During inference we evaluate 300 RoIs as in [18] for fair comparisons. The results are post-processed by non-maximum suppression (NMS) using a threshold of 0.3 IoU [7], as standard practice."
How can highest-loss examples be selected?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

By sorting all RoIs (positive and negative) by loss and selecting B RoIs with the highest loss","Losses are calculated individually for each RoI, then sorted. Then, only the losses of the RoIs chosen are used for backpropagation.","It is easy for our method to adopt online hard example mining (OHEM) [22] during training. Our negligible per-RoI computation enables nearly cost-free example mining. Assuming N proposals per image, in the forward pass, we evaluate the loss of all N proposals. Then we sort all RoIs (positive and negative) by loss and select B RoIs that have the highest loss. Backpropagation [11] is performed based on the selected examples. Because our per-RoI computation is negligible, the forward time is nearly not affected by N, in contrast to OHEM Fast R-CNN in [22] that may double training time. We provide comprehensive timing statistics in Table 5 in the next section."

What are the evidences that region-wise computations are of low cost ?,"The evidences that region-wise computations are of low cost are:

* R-FCN has negligible per-region cost.
* R-FCN is 2.5 times faster than Faster R-CNN on a K40 GPU.
* R-FCN trains faster than Faster R-CNN.
* Mining hard examples adds no cost to R-FCN training","As seen in Table 5, Faster R-CNN is 2.5 times slower than R-FCN when mining for 300 RoIs, and 6 times slower when mining for 2000 RoIs, proving that region-wise computations are of low cost.","Next we compare with standard “Faster R-CNN + ResNet-101” [9] which is the strongest competitor and the top-performer on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ImageNet benchmarks. We use k\times k=7\times 7 in the following.Table 5 shows the comparisons. Faster R-CNN evaluates a 10-layer subnetwork for each region to achieve good accuracy, but R-FCN has negligible per-region cost.With 300 RoIs at test time, Faster R-CNN takes 0.42s per image, 2.5\times slower than our R-FCN that takes 0.17s per image (on a K40 GPU; this number is 0.11s on a Titan X GPU). R-FCN also trains faster than Faster R-CNN.Moreover, hard example mining [22] adds no cost to R-FCN training (Table 5).It is feasible to train R-FCN when mining from 2000 RoIs, in which case Faster R-CNN is 6\times slower (2.9s vs. 0.46s). But experiments show that mining from a larger set of candidates (e.g., 2000) has no benefit (Table 5). So we use 300 RoIs for both training and inference in other parts of this paper."
What is the purpose of bounding box regression?,"To parameterize a bounding box as (tx, ty, tw, th) following the parameterization in [6]",Bounding box regression is needed to find the coordinates of the bounding boxes of the objects within the RoI.,"We further address bounding box regression [7, 6] in a similar way. Aside from the above k^{2}(C+1)-d convolutional layer, we append a sibling 4k^{2}-d convolutional layer for bounding box regression. The position-sensitive RoI pooling is performed on this bank of 4k^{2} maps, producing a 4k^{2}-d vector for each RoI. Then it is aggregated into a 4-d vector by average voting. This 4-d vector parameterizes a bounding box as t=(t_{x},t_{y},t_{w},t_{h}) following the parameterization in [6]. We note that we perform class-agnostic bounding box regression for simplicity, but the class-specific counterpart (i.e., with a 4k^{2}C-d output layer) is applicable."
"What is the difference between (x,y) possible pairs and number of pixels n in each bin?","The number of possible pairs (x,y) in each bin is k^2, while the number of pixels n in each bin is approximately w/k x h/k","The number of possible pairs (x,y) is n, as (x,y) iterates through each pixel in the bin.","Position-sensitive score maps & Position-sensitive RoI pooling. To explicitly encode position information into each RoI, we divide each RoI rectangle into k\times k bins by a regular grid. For an RoI rectangle of a size w\times h, a bin is of a size \approx\frac{w}{k}\times\frac{h}{k} [8, 6].In our method, the last convolutional layer is constructed to produce k^{2} score maps for each category. Inside the (i,j)-th bin (0\leq i,j\leq k-1), we define a position-sensitive RoI pooling operation that pools only over the (i,j)-th score map:r_{c}(i,j\leavevmode\nobreak\ |\leavevmode\nobreak\ \Theta)=\sum_{(x,y)\in\text{bin}(i,j)}z_{i,j,c}(x+x_{0},y+y_{0}\leavevmode\nobreak\ |\leavevmode\nobreak\ \Theta)/n.(1)Here r_{c}(i,j) is the pooled response in the (i,j)-th bin for the c-th category, z_{i,j,c} is one score map out of the k^{2}(C+1) score maps, (x_{0},y_{0}) denotes the top-left corner of an RoI, n is the number of pixels in the bin, and \Theta denotes all learnable parameters of the network. The (i,j)-th bin spans \lfloor i\frac{w}{k}\rfloor\leq x<\lceil(i+1)\frac{w}{k}\rceil and \lfloor j\frac{h}{k}\rfloor\leq y<\lceil(j+1)\frac{h}{k}\rceil.The operation of Eqn.(1) is illustrated in Figure 1, where a color represents a pair of (i,j).Eqn.(1) performs average pooling (as we use throughout this paper), but max pooling can be conducted as well."
Does each channel maps the a response from a different position of the image ?,"No.

Each channel of the position-sensitive score maps learned by R-FCN maps the response from the same position of the image, but with different orientations. The kxk spatial grid describes relative positions within the object category, so each channel corresponds to a different orientation of the object",The k^2 channels for each category C of the final convolutional layer each map to cells within a spatial grid that correspond to a position relative to an object.,"Visualization.In Figure 4 and 4 we visualize the position-sensitive score maps learned by R-FCN when k\times k=3\times 3. These specialized maps are expected to be strongly activated at a specific relative position of an object. For example, the “top-center-sensitive” score map exhibits high scores roughly near the top-center position of an object.If a candidate box precisely overlaps with a true object (Figure 4), most of the k^{2} bins in the RoI are strongly activated, and their voting leads to a high score. On the contrary, if a candidate box does not correctly overlaps with a true object (Figure 4), some of the k^{2} bins in the RoI are not activated, and the voting score is low. Given the proposal regions (RoIs), the R-FCN architecture is designed to classify the RoIs into object categories and background. In R-FCN, all learnable weight layers are convolutional and are computed on the entire image. The last convolutional layer produces a bank of k^{2} position-sensitive score maps for each category, and thus has a k^{2}(C+1)-channel output layer with C object categories (+1 for background). The bank of k^{2} score maps correspond to a k\times k spatial grid describing relative positions. For example, with k\times k=3\times 3, the 9 score maps encode the cases of {top-left, top-center, top-right, …, bottom-right} of an object category."
What are the benefits of selective pooling?,"Selective pooling in the position-sensitive RoI layer enables the network to learn specialized position-sensitive score maps, which improves object detection performance","Selective pooling allows the model to learn position-sensitive score maps, which contain information crucial for learning. This can be seen from the k = 1 case, meaning there is only one score map and no spatial information is learned, where the model fails to converge. Selective pooling also changes the architecture in a way that there is no need for additional layers after the final RoI layer, which greatly decreases computation time.","The concept of position-sensitive score maps is partially inspired by [3] that develops FCNs for instance-level semantic segmentation.We further introduce the position-sensitive RoI pooling layer that shepherds learning of the score maps for object detection. There is no learnable layer after the RoI layer, enabling nearly cost-free region-wise computation and speeding up both training and inference. The importance of position-sensitivity is further demonstrated by setting k=1, for which R-FCN is unable to converge. In this degraded case, no spatial information can be explicitly captured within an RoI. Moreover, we report that naïve Faster R-CNN is able to converge if its RoI pooling output resolution is 1\times 1, but the mAP further drops by a large margin to 61.7% (Table 2). R-FCN ends with a position-sensitive RoI pooling layer. This layer aggregates the outputs of the last convolutional layer and generates scores for each RoI. Unlike [8, 6], our position-sensitive RoI layer conducts selective pooling, and each of the k\times k bin aggregates responses from only one score map out of the bank of k\times k score maps. With end-to-end training, this RoI layer shepherds the last convolutional layer to learn specialized position-sensitive score maps.Figure 1 illustrates this idea. Figure 4 and 4 visualize an example. The details are introduced as follows."
What's the reason for sharing features between R-FCN and RPN,To reduce computational cost and improve performance by leveraging shared contextual information,"The feature maps contain information from the input image. The RPN uses those features to find RoIs, while the R-FCN uses those features to detect objects.","Inference. As illustrated in Figure 2, the feature maps shared between RPN and R-FCN are computed (on an image with a single scale of 600). Then the RPN part proposes RoIs, on which the R-FCN part evaluates category-wise scores and regresses bounding boxes.During inference we evaluate 300 RoIs as in [18] for fair comparisons. The results are post-processed by non-maximum suppression (NMS) using a threshold of 0.3 IoU [7], as standard practice."
Should we need to increase the size of the network to reach considerable efficiency after adding region-wise layers?,No,"No, as seen by the model presented in the paper, performance can be maintained or even improved while keeping computational efficiency high and not adding region-wise layers.","In this paper, we develop a framework called Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) for object detection. Our network consists of shared, fully convolutional architectures as is the case of FCN [15]. To incorporate translation variance into FCN, we construct a set of position-sensitive score maps by using a bank of specialized convolutional layers as the FCN output. Each of these score maps encodes the position information with respect to a relative spatial position (e.g., “to the left of an object”). On top of this FCN, we append a position-sensitive RoI pooling layer that shepherds information from these score maps, with no weight (convolutional/fc) layers following. The entire architecture is learned end-to-end. All learnable layers are convolutional and shared on the entire image, yet encode spatial information required for object detection. Figure 1 illustrates the key idea and Table 1 compares the methodologies among region-based detectors. On the other hand, our R-FCN system has significantly better accuracy (Table 2). Its mAP (76.6%) is on par with the standard Faster R-CNN’s (76.4%, Table 5). These results indicate that our position-sensitive strategy manages to encode useful spatial information for locating objects, without using any learnable layer after RoI pooling. Next we compare with standard “Faster R-CNN + ResNet-101” [9] which is the strongest competitor and the top-performer on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ImageNet benchmarks. We use k\times k=7\times 7 in the following.Table 5 shows the comparisons. Faster R-CNN evaluates a 10-layer subnetwork for each region to achieve good accuracy, but R-FCN has negligible per-region cost.With 300 RoIs at test time, Faster R-CNN takes 0.42s per image, 2.5\times slower than our R-FCN that takes 0.17s per image (on a K40 GPU; this number is 0.11s on a Titan X GPU). R-FCN also trains faster than Faster R-CNN.Moreover, hard example mining [22] adds no cost to R-FCN training (Table 5).It is feasible to train R-FCN when mining from 2000 RoIs, in which case Faster R-CNN is 6\times slower (2.9s vs. 0.46s). But experiments show that mining from a larger set of candidates (e.g., 2000) has no benefit (Table 5). So we use 300 RoIs for both training and inference in other parts of this paper. We presented Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks, a simple but accurate and efficient framework for object detection. Our system naturally adopts the state-of-the-art image classification backbones, such as ResNets, that are by design fully convolutional. Our method achieves accuracy competitive with the Faster R-CNN counterpart, but is much faster during both training and inference."
"What do authors mean by saying that RoI layer was added ""unnaturally"" in the ResNet  ?","The authors mean that the RoI layer was added in a way that deviates from the natural progression of the network's architecture, specifically by inserting it between two sets of convolutional layers","Old object detection networks used two subnetworks, one being a convolutional subnetwork with a pooling layer, and another being fully connected layers. The pooling layer served as a RoI pooling layer. The authors imply that natural intuition for creating a fully convolutional network would be to get rid of the fully connected layers and just keep using the final pooling layer as the only layer in the RoI subnetwork. But in ResNet, the RoI subnetwork is actually in the middle of the network, which the authors deem to be unnatural.","A prevalent family [8, 6, 18] of deep networks for object detection can be divided into two subnetworks by the Region-of-Interest (RoI) pooling layer [6]: (i) a shared, “fully convolutional” subnetwork independent of RoIs, and (ii) an RoI-wise subnetwork that does not share computation. This decomposition [8] was historically resulted from the pioneering classification architectures, such as AlexNet [10] and VGG Nets [23], that consist of two subnetworks by design — a convolutional subnetwork ending with a spatial pooling layer, followed by several fully-connected (fc) layers. Thus the (last) spatial pooling layer in image classification networks is naturally turned into the RoI pooling layer in object detection networks [8, 6, 18]. But recent state-of-the-art image classification networks such as Residual Nets (ResNets) [9] and GoogLeNets [24, 26] are by design fully convolutional111Only the last layer is fully-connected, which is removed and replaced when fine-tuning for object detection.. By analogy, it appears natural to use all convolutional layers to construct the shared, convolutional subnetwork in the object detection architecture, leaving the RoI-wise subnetwork no hidden layer. However, as empirically investigated in this work, this naïve solution turns out to have considerably inferior detection accuracy that does not match the network’s superior classification accuracy. To remedy this issue, in the ResNet paper [9] the RoI pooling layer of the Faster R-CNN detector [18] is unnaturally inserted between two sets of convolutional layers — this creates a deeper RoI-wise subnetwork that improves accuracy, at the cost of lower speed due to the unshared per-RoI computation."
"How can one explain the statement ""inferior detection accuracy that does not match the network’s superior classification accuracy"" mentioned by the authors ?","The statement ""inferior detection accuracy that does not match the network's superior classification accuracy"" can be explained by the fact that the naïve solution of using all convolutional layers to construct the shared, convolutional subnetwork in the object detection architecture does not respect the spatial information and therefore leads to lower detection accuracy compared to the standard Faster R-CNN system that inserts the RoI pooling layer between conv4 and conv5","The authors show in Table 2 that a naive implementation of Faster R-CNN, which used the methodology that the authors claimed to have inferior detection accuracy, actually does have inferior detection accuracy.","But recent state-of-the-art image classification networks such as Residual Nets (ResNets) [9] and GoogLeNets [24, 26] are by design fully convolutional111Only the last layer is fully-connected, which is removed and replaced when fine-tuning for object detection..

Analysis. Table 2 shows the results. We note that the standard (not naïve) Faster R-CNN in the ResNet paper [9] achieves 76.4% mAP with ResNet-101 (see also Table 5), which inserts the RoI pooling layer between conv4 and conv5 [9]. As a comparison, the naïve Faster R-CNN (that applies RoI pooling after conv5) has a drastically lower mAP of 68.9% (Table 2). This comparison empirically justifies the importance of respecting spatial information by inserting RoI pooling between layers for the Faster R-CNN system. Similar observations are reported in [19]. Naïve Faster R-CNN. As discussed in the introduction, one may use all convolutional layers in ResNet-101 to compute the shared feature maps, and adopt RoI pooling after the last convolutional layer (after conv5). An inexpensive 21-class fc layer is evaluated on each RoI (so this variant is “almost” fully convolutional). The à trous trick is used for fair comparisons."
Will these embeddings be based on measuring similarities between features of new faces and features extracted from faces which the model was trained on ?,Yes,FaceNet embeddings can be used to measure similarity between new faces and trained faces.,"In this paper we present a unified system for face verification (is this thesame person), recognition (who is this person) and clustering (find commonpeople among these faces). Our method is based on learning a Euclideanembedding per image using a deep convolutional network. The network is trainedsuch that the squared L2 distances in the embedding space directly correspond toface similarity: faces of the same person have small distances and faces ofdistinct people have large distances."
"What does ""online triplet mining method"" mean?","Sure! Here's my answer:

FaceNet uses an online triplet mining method to train its embedding",Online triplet mining method generates two matching face thumbnails and a non-matching face thumbnail from the training data.,"In contrast to these approaches, FaceNet directly trains its output to be acompact 128-D embedding using a triplet-based loss function based onLMNN [19].

The thumbnails aretight crops of the face area, no 2D or 3D alignment, other than scale andtranslation is performed."
How could we recognize previously unseen person using k-NN?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

We could recognize previously unseen persons using k-NN by simply adding their new embeddings to the existing database and comparing them to the embeddings of known individuals using the same distance metric",k-NN classification can be used to recognize the unseen faces by computing the distance between the FaceNet embeddings.,"Once this embedding has been produced, then the aforementioned tasks becomestraight-forward: face verification simply involves thresholding the distancebetween the two embeddings; recognition becomes a k-NN classification problem;and clustering can be achieved using off-the-shelf techniques such as k-meansor agglomerative clustering."
What does curriculum learning aim at ?,"Curriculum learning aims to ensure that the training data is well-structured and increasingly difficult, so that the network can learn and improve its performance consistently",Curriculum learning is a method for good triplets selection.,"Choosing which triplets to use turnsout to be very important for achieving good performance and, inspired bycurriculum learning [1], we present a novel onlinenegative exemplar mining strategy which ensures consistently increasingdifficulty of triplets as the network trains. To improveclustering accuracy, we also explore hard-positive mining techniques whichencourage spherical clusters for the embeddings of a single person."
What do hard-positive mining techniques mean?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Hard-positive mining techniques refer to strategies that select the most difficult examples, or ""hard negative examples,"" to be used as part of the training data. These techniques aim to encourage the network to learn more robust and accurate representations by exposing it to a diverse range of challenging examples",Hard-positive mining techniques use spherical clusters for the embeddings of a single person.,"Choosing which triplets to use turnsout to be very important for achieving good performance and, inspired bycurriculum learning [1], we present a novel onlinenegative exemplar mining strategy which ensures consistently increasingdifficulty of triplets as the network trains.

Does the inception model run different convolutions in parallel on cropped portions of the original images or on the same image?,The Inception model runs different convolutions in parallel on cropped portions of the original images,Inception model runs convolutions in parallel but it is not clear from paper that it runs on patches or complete image.,"In this paper we explore two different deep network architectures that havebeen recently used to great success in the computer vision community. Both aredeep convolutional networks [8, 11]. The firstarchitecture is based on the Zeiler&Fergus [22] model whichconsists of multiple interleaved layers of convolutions, non-linearactivations, local response normalizations, and max pooling layers. Weadditionally add several 1{\times}1{\times}d convolution layers inspired bythe work of [9]. The second architecture is based on theInception model of Szegedy et al. which was recently used as thewinning approach for ImageNet 2014 [16]. These networks usemixed layers that run several different convolutional and pooling layers inparallel and concatenate their responses. We have found that these models canreduce the number of parameters by up to 20 times and have the potential toreduce the number of FLOPS required for comparable performance."
"Could we consider ""randomly sampled negative faces added to each mini-batch"" as a mean of making the model more regularized against negative faces?","Yes, randomly sampling negative faces and adding them to each mini-batch can be seen as a form of regularization against negative faces",Model can be regularized against negative and poorly labeled faces by adding hard positive and negative examples in each mini-batch,"It is infeasible to compute the \operatorname{argmin} and \operatorname{argmax} across the wholetraining set. Additionally, it might lead to poor training, as mislabelled andpoorly imaged faces would dominate the hard positives and negatives.There are two obvious choices that avoid this issue:•Generate triplets offline every n steps, using the most recentnetwork checkpoint and computing the \operatorname{argmin} and \operatorname{argmax} on a subsetof the data.•Generate triplets online. This can be done by selecting the hardpositive/negative exemplars from within a mini-batch. To have a meaningful representation of the anchor-positive distances, it needsto be ensured that a minimal number of exemplars of any one identity is presentin each mini-batch. In our experiments we sample the training data such thataround 40 faces are selected per identity per mini-batch. Additionally, randomlysampled negative faces are added to each mini-batch."
Could the model just choose the embedding function to be zero just to overcome the very small distance that might occur in case of choosing the hardest negatives during triplet selection?,"No.

The model cannot choose the embedding function to be zero to overcome the small distance issue during triplet selection, as the embedding function is learned during training and is not a parameter that can be set to zero. Additionally, setting the embedding function to zero would not help the model overcome the issue of collapsed models, as it would still result in a model with poor generalization performance",No the zero embeddings can result in a collapsed model.,"Selecting the hardest negatives can in practice lead to bad local minima early on intraining, specifically it can result in a collapsed model (i.e. f(x)=0). Inorder to mitigate this, it helps to select x_{i}^{n} such that\left\|f(x_{i}^{a})-f(x_{i}^{p})\right\|_{2}^{2}<\left\|f(x_{i}^{a})-f(x_{i}^{n})\right\|_{2}^{2}\;.(4)We call these negative exemplars semi-hard, as they are further awayfrom the anchor than the positive exemplar, but still hard because the squareddistance is close to the anchor-positive distance. Those negatives lie insidethe margin \alpha."
Why did the authors finetune the VAE on language understanding tasks?,To improve the generalization of the VAE on low-resource language understanding tasks by fine-tuning the pre-trained model and the classifier,"The authors might be performing finetuning of the pretrained model and classifier weights to perform better on low resource language understanding tasks. However, the authors do explore two different methods - a feature-based method and a fine tune method, and it is not obvious if one is radically better than the other.","Due to the regularization term L R , OPTIMUS can organize sentences in the way specified by the prior distribution. For basic VAEs, a smooth feature space is learned, which is specifically beneficial for better generalization when the number of task-specific labeled data is low. To have a fair comparison, we follow the BERT paper, where the hidden feature of [CLS] is used as the sentence-level representation. In this way, the linear classifiers for both models have the same number of trainable parameters. Though the latent vector z is typically used as sentence-level representation in VAE literature, we argue that the KL regularization applied on z has a large impact on the preceding layer feature h [CLS] . Specifically, h [CLS] is fed into an linear classifier W C ∈ R K×H, where K is the number of classes, with objective − log(softmax(h [CLS] W C >  )). Two schemes are used: (i) Fine-tuning, where both the pre-trained model and the classifier are updated; (ii) Feature-based, where pre-trained model weights are frozen to provide embeddings for the classifier update."
How does training pre-training a latent space in Optimus lead to higher performance for dialog generation? Is it because the whole dialog can be encoded in the latent space?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Yes, training a pre-trained latent space in Optimus leads to higher performance for dialog generation because the whole dialog can be encoded in the latent space. By jointly embedding the history and response in a single latent space, Optimus can capture the long-range dependencies and contextual information in the dialog, leading to more coherent and relevant responses","There is no information about dialog generation specifically, to explain if this outperformance by OPTIMUS can be attributed specifically to being able to encode the entire dialog in latent space.","Dialog response generation The open-domain dialog response generation task is considered: generating responses z given a dialog history c. Following (Gao et al, 2019a), we embed the history and response in a joint latent space as z_{S2S} and z_{ae}, respectively. A fusion regularization is used to match the responses to the context. We consider Dailydialog (Li et al, 2017) used in (Gu et al, 2019), which has 13,118 daily conversations. Each utterance is processed as the response of previous 10 context utterances from both speakers. The baseline methods are described in Appendix. We measure the performance using Bleu (Chen and Cherry, 2014), and compute the precision, recall and Fl in Table 4. OPTIMUS shows higher Bleu scores than all existing baselines."
"Are there any similar approaches to OPTIMUS, but on bigger and more modern architectures (e.g., GPT-J, T5)?",Yes,"This paper does not mention any existing approaches similar to OPTIMUS which use larger models such as GPT-J or T-5. The authors do mention in multiple places that using VAEs (which is what OPTIMUS is) is not very common in the field, and that existing attempts to use VAEs for language modelling typically use smaller models that are not very deep. Both these pieces of information suggest that work using models such as GPT-J or T5 for similar VAE-based approaches does not exist, but it is not possible to say that with certainty from the contents of this paper alone.","While deep generative models (DGMs) such as VAEs are theoretically attractive due to its principle nature, it is now rarely used by practitioners in the modern pre-trained language modeling era where BERT/GPT dominate with strong empirical performance. That’s why this paper makes a timely contribution to making DGMs practical for NLP. We hope that this paper will help renew interest in DGMs for this purpose.Hence, we deliberately keep a simple model, believing that the first pre-trained big VAE model itself and its implications are novel: it helps the community to recognize the importance of DGMs in the pre-training era, and revisit DGMs to make it more practical.Indeed, Optimus is uniquely positioned to learn a smooth latent space to organize sentences, which can enable guided language generation compared with GPT-2, and yield better generalization in low-resource language understanding tasks than BERT. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma and Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) provide a tractable method to train latent-variable generative models. In NLP, latent variables may assume the role of higher-level sentence representations, which govern a lower-level word-by-word generation process, thus facilitating controlled text generation (Bowman et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2017). By representing sentences in a low-dimensional latent space, VAEs allow easy manipulation of sentences using the corresponding compact vector representations, such as feature regularization specified by prior distributions, and guided sentence generation with interpretable vector operators. Despite the attractive theoretical strengths, the current language VAEs are often built with shallow network architectures, such as two-layer LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). This limits the model’s capacity and leads to sub-optimal performance."
How is the Optimus pre-training objectives and its information bottleneck approach any different to those of traditional VAEs (used for image generation)?,"The Optimus pre-training objectives and its information bottleneck approach differ from traditional VAEs used for image generation in several ways:

1. Latent vector injection: Optimus introduces two schemes to inject conditioning vectors into GPT-2 without re-training it, which is not a common practice in traditional VAEs.
2. Combining BERT/GPT-2: The design idea to combine existing PLMs for larger and complex models is a novel approach in Optimus, not typically seen in traditional VAEs.
3. Pre-training on massive datasets: Optimus demonstrates that pre-training on massive datasets can effectively reduce KL vanishing, whereas traditional VAEs often use smaller datasets.
4. IB perspective: Optimus provides a principled approach to balancing compactness and usability of learned representations from the perspective of information bottleneck, which is not a primary focus in traditional VAEs.

Overall, Optimus introduces several novel technical contributions and implications that differentiate it from traditional VAEs used for image generation","The paper explains how information theoretic principles can be used to measure the predictive power of a model and its' compactness (a measure of how complex the learned representations are)and represent it as a tradeoff. They explain how they manage to inject conditioning vectors into GPT without having to pretrain it again specifically for this and also discuss how they combine GPT and BERT. However, the authors do not specifically discuss the differences between their VAE by comparing it with VAEs used for image generation. Presumably, this might be because the authors intended to create a simple VAE model, as a proof of concept that such models can work well for language tasks as well, which is why might not be making extensive customisations to tailor VAEs for language tasks.","From an information theory perspective, information bottleneck (IB) provides a principled approach to find the trade-off between predictive power and complexity (compactness) when summarizing observed data in learned representations. We show that our Optimus pre-training objectives effectively practice the IB principle as follows. Along the way to build the first big VAE language model, there are several technical contributions/implications that are novel: (\textup{\it i}) Latent vector injection: this work demonstrates two schemes to discuss how to effectively inject conditioning vectors into GPT-2 without re-training it.(\textup{\it ii}) The design idea to combine BERT/GPT-2 serves as a practical recipe to inspire people to integrate and reuse existing PLMs for larger and complex models.(\textup{\it iii}) Pre-training on massive datasets itself is an effective approach to reduce KL vanishing, as demonstrated by the state of-the-art performance on four VAE language modeling datasets. (\textup{\it iv}) The proof of VAE objective from the lens of IB, showing that VAE is a principled approach to balance the compactness and usability of learned representations.(\textup{\it v}) Improved performance on several language tasks shows the importance and necessity of pre-training a latent space."
"How are WordPiece Embeddings and Byte Pair Encoding tokenization different, and why do BERT and GPT-2 use them respectively?","WordPiece Embeddings (WPE) and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization differ in their approach to representing words as embeddings. WPE represents each word as a combination of its token, position, and segment embeddings, while BPE represents each word as a combination of its token and position embeddings. BERT uses WPE because it was designed for language understanding tasks, which require more contextual information about words. GPT-2 uses BPE because it was designed for language generation tasks, which require more efficient tokenization","BERT and GPT2 are different kinds of models, which is why they might be using different kinds of encoding schemes. BERT is primarily an encoder model, while GPT-like models are generative models that autoregressively predict the next token based on the series of tokens seen so far. This primary difference in class of models might explain why BERT uses WPE while GPT uses BPE tokenization. More details on why these specific tokenization schemes are used for each model can not be found in this paper.","PLMs can generally play two different roles:(\textup{\it i})a generic encoder such as BERT Devlin et al. (2019) to provide contextualized representations for language understanding tasks, and(\textup{\it ii})a powerful decoder such as GPT-2 Radford et al. (2019) to generate text sequences in an auto-regressive manner. In a bid to combine language understanding and generation tasks in one unified framework, several model variants have been proposed, including UniLM Dong et al. (2019), BART Lewis et al. (2019), and T5 Raffel et al. (2019). Although significant performance improvement has been reported on a wide range of NLP tasks, these models lack of explicit modeling of structures in a compact latent space, rendering it difficult to control language generation/representation from an abstract level. Two technical questions remain, when pre-training Optimus from BERT & GPT-2:(\textup{\it i}) How to represent sentences, since the two PLMs employ different tokenization schemes?(\textup{\it ii}) How to adapt a pre-trained GPT-2 to arbitrary conditional input without re-training the model again? Controllable GPT-2 models have been studied in Keskar et al. (2019); Zellers et al. (2019); Peng et al. (2020a, b) when prescribed control codes/tokens are provided, but it is still unknown how to ground GPT-2 to arbitrary conditional inputs. In BERT, WordPiece Embeddings (WPE) is used for tokenization (vocabulary size is 28996 for the cased version). In GPT-2, the modified Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Radford et al. (2019) is used for tokenization (vocabulary size is 50260). A given token is represented as {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Emb}}, by summing the corresponding token, position and segment embeddings 333Optimus does not require segment embeddings, but we remain it due to BERT initialization..For a sentence, we present it in both types of tokenization: the input of encoder is WPE, and the output of decoder is BPE to compute the reconstruction loss. However, the only source of variation in NLMs, GPT2 and GPT3 is modeled in the conditionals at every step: the text generation process only depends on previous word tokens, and there is limited capacity for the generation to be guided by the higher-level structures that are likely presented in natural language, such as tense, topics or sentiment."
"If the same information from the latent vector is being added during decoding, why did the Memory scheme yield higher performance?","The Memory scheme yields higher performance because it allows the decoder to attend the latent information at every layer of the network directly, while the Embedding method only allows the decoder to see the latent information at the input and output layers","The authors theorize that the memory scheme is better since the latent information is accessible to every layer in the neural network, instead of being available to only two layers (input, output) in the embedding approach.","Similar to BERT, the first token of every sentence is always a special classification token ([CLS]). The last-layer hidden state {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}\in\mathbb{R}^{H} corresponding to this token is used as the sentence-level representation. It further constructs the latent representation \boldsymbol{z}={{\bf W}}_{\text{E}}{\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}, where \boldsymbol{z}\in\mathbb{R}^{P} is a P-dimensional vector and {{\bf W}}_{\text{E}}\in\mathbb{R}^{P\times H} is the weight matrix. To facilitate \boldsymbol{z} in GPT-2 decoding without re-training the weights, we consider two schemes, illustrated in Figure 2:•Memory: \boldsymbol{z} plays the role of an additional memory vector {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Mem}} for GPT2 to attend. Specifically, {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Mem}}={{\bf W}}_{\text{M}}\boldsymbol{z}, where {{\bf W}}_{\text{M}}\in\mathbb{R}^{LH\times P} is the weight matrix. {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Mem}}\in\mathbb{R}^{LH} is separated into L vectors of length H, each of which is attended by GPT-2 in one layer.•Embedding: \boldsymbol{z} is added on the original embedding layer, and directly used in every decoding step. The new embedding representation is {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Emb}}^{\prime}={\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Emb}}+{{\bf W}}_{\text{D}}\boldsymbol{z}, where {{\bf W}}_{\text{D}}\in\mathbb{R}^{H\times P}.We study their empirical performance in Section B.1 of Appendix, and observe that Memory is significantly more effective than Embedding, and the integration of both schemes yields slightly better results. We hypothesize that the reason why Memory is superior is because it allows the decoder to attend the latent information at every layer ofthe network directly, while the Embedding method only allows the decoder to see the latentinformation at the input and output layer.In our experiments, we use the integration scheme by default.In summary, the encoder parameters \boldsymbol{\phi}=\{\boldsymbol{\phi}_{\text{BERT}},{{\bf W}}_{\text{E}}\}, and decoder parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}=\{\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{GPT-2}},{{\bf W}}_{\text{M}},{{\bf W}}_{\text{D}}\}."
"Why does annealing the value of beta and, as a consequence, decrease the KL regularization during training cause the decoder to make greater use of z?","By annealing the value of beta and decreasing the KL regularization during training, the decoder is able to make greater use of z because the model is no longer penalized as heavily for deviating from the prior distribution. This allows the decoder to explore the latent space more freely and use the information in z more effectively","While the authors explained in detail the method in which they cyclically annealed the value of beta while training their VAE and that KL regularization impacts features on the previous layer, this paper does not delve into the reasons why annealing the value of beta causes the decoder to make greater use of z. This is possibly because annealing beta as described in the paper is a widely used practice while training models such as these, which is why the authors may not have chosen to explain this assuming that these are broadly known pieces of information.","To reduce this issue, we follow the intuition that if the encoder is providing useful information from the beginning of decoder training, the decoder is more likely to make use of \boldsymbol{z} Fu et al. (2019); He et al. (2019). Specifically, we use the cyclical schedule to anneal \beta for 10 periods Fu et al. (2019).Within one period, there are three consecutive stages: Training AE (\beta=0) for 0.5 proportion, annealing \beta from 0 to 1 for 0.25 proportion, and fixing \beta=1 for 0.25 proportion. When \beta>0, we use the KL thresholding scheme Li et al. (2019); Kingma et al. (2016), and replace the KL term \mathcal{L}_{R} in (6) with a hinge loss term that maxes each component of the original KL with a constant \lambda:ℒR′=∑imax[λ,KL(qϕ(zi|𝒙)||p(zi))]\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{R}^{\prime}=\sum_{i}\max[\lambda,\mbox{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(z_{i}|\boldsymbol{x})||p(z_{i}))]caligraphic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_max [ italic_λ , KL ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | bold_italic_x ) | | italic_p ( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ) ](9)Here, z_{i} denotes the ith dimension of \boldsymbol{z}. Usingthe thresholding objective causes learning to give up driving down KL for dimensions of \boldsymbol{z} that are already beneath the target compression rate. Due to the regularization term \mathcal{L}_{R}, Optimus can organize sentences in the way specified by the prior distribution. For basic VAEs, a smooth feature space is learned, which is specifically beneficial for better generalization when the number of task-specific labeled data is low.To have a fair comparison, we follow the BERT paper, where the hidden feature of [CLS] is used as thesentence-level representation. In this way, the linear classifiers for both models have the same number of trainableparameters. Though the latent vector \boldsymbol{z} is typically used as sentence-level representation in VAE literature, we argue that the KL regularization applied on \boldsymbol{z} has a large impact on the preceding layer feature {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}.Specifically, {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}} is fed into an linear classifier {{\bf W}}_{\text{C}}\in\mathbb{R}^{K\times H}, where K is the number of classes, with objective -\log(\text{softmax}({\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}{{\bf W}}_{\text{C}}^{\top})). Two schemes are used:(\textup{\it i}) Fine-tuning, where both the pre-trained model and the classifier are updated;(\textup{\it ii}) Feature-based, where pre-trained model weights are frozen to provide embeddings for the classifier update."
Why does higher performance than hierarchical VAE (hVAE) show that it is important to pre-train a latent space? Did hVAE not pre-train a latent space or was the approach different?,"Pre-training a latent space is important because Optimus, which does so, outperforms hVAE, which does not or does so differently","This paper does not contain detailed information about VAEs so answering it with information from this paper is not possible. The authors mention that their outperformance of existing VAE methods might be due to the efficacy of their pretraining method which is able to solve the KL vanishing issue sufficiently, but it is unclear if hVAE faced similar problems or not.","The results are shown in Table 1. Various \lambda values are used, we observe a trade-off between language modeling and representation learning, controlled by \lambda. Compared with existing VAE methods, Optimus achieve significantly lower perplexity, and higher MI/AU. This indicates that our pre-training method is an effective approach to reduce KL vanishing issue and training VAEs, especially given the fact that we only fine-tune on these datasets for one epoch. Optimus achieves lower perplexity compared with GPT-2 on three out of four datasets. Intuitively, this is because the model can leverage the prior language knowledge encoded in \boldsymbol{z}. This gap is larger, when the sentences in the dataset exhibit common regularities, such as \mathtt{SNLI}, where the prior plays a more important/effective role in this scenario.Though the form of our model is simple, Optimus shows stronger empirical performance than sophisticated models that are particularly designed for long-text, such as hVAE in Shen et al. (2019). For example, the KL and PPL ofOptimus (15.09 and 22.79) are much better than hVAE (6.8 and 45.8) on Yelp dataset. This verifies the importance of pre-training a latent space.The full experimental results are shown in Table 8, 9, 10 and 11 of Appendix."
"What does ""Active Units"" mean and how is it measured?",Active Units (AU) refer to the units or dimensions of the latent space that are most relevant for generating the output language. They are measured by calculating the Mutual Information (MI) between the latent space and the output language,"“Active units” is a measurement metric used by the authors to measure the learning capacity of their model. Additional information on how it is measured is not available in this paper, presumably because it is a widely known unit of measurement in the field.","There are two types of metrics to evaluate language VAEs.(\textup{\it i}) Generation capability: we use perplexity (PPL). Note that NLM and GPT-2 has exactly PPL, while VAEs does not. Following He et al. (2019), we use the importance weighted bound in Burda et al. (2015) to approximate \log p(\boldsymbol{x}), and report PPL.(\textup{\it ii}) Representation learning capability: Active units (AU) of \boldsymbol{z} and its Mutual Information (MI) with \boldsymbol{x}.We report the full results with ELBO, KL and Reconstruction in Appendix, but note that higher ELBO does not necessarily yield better language modeling."
"How do the specific contributions of this work make the construction of deep generative models, like VAEs, for language modeling more practical?","The specific contributions of this work make the construction of deep generative models, like VAEs, for language modeling more practical by providing a tractable method to train latent-variable generative models, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training on massive datasets, and showing the importance and necessity of pre-training a latent space for language tasks","The main thesis of this work is around the idea that large VAE models for language tasks can work effectively, and the authors attempt to provide initial evidence for this by implementing a large model which they named OPTIMUS. The first major contribution the authors make is in showing how the KL vanishing issue is addressed in the pretraining phase. Next, the authors explain how conditioning vectors can be injected into GPT without the need for retraining, which brings down the cost and barrier to entry to develop models such as these. Finally, the authors also discuss how to combine multiple pretrained language models (PLMs) such as BERT and GPT, which have very different input formats (i.e. tokenization schemes).","Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) Kingma and Welling (2013); Rezende et al.

How is using a conditional GAN to produce a latent vector from a label different to using the encoder in OPTIMUS with just the label as its input? ,"Using a conditional GAN to produce a latent vector from a label is different from using the encoder in OPTIMUS with just the label as its input because the former generates a latent vector that is specifically tailored to the given label, while the latter generates a latent vector that captures the underlying structure of the data","The conditional GAN generates a latent vector which is then passed to OPTIMUS' decoder, which produces the output. It is unclear if merely passing a label to OPTIMUS' encoder would be sufficient to generate a useful latent space encoding since the OPTIMUS encoder has not been trained with this objective in mind.","The short \mathtt{Yelp} dataset collected in Shen et al. (2017) is used. It contains 444K training sentences, and we use separated datasets of 10K sentences for validation/testing, respectively. The goal is to generate text reviews given the positive/negative sentiment. We fine-tune Optimus using the VAE objective on the dataset, then freeze backbone weights. A conditional GAN Mirza and Osindero (2014) is trained on the fixed latent space. The generation process is to first produce a latent vector \boldsymbol{z}_{y} based on a given label y using conditional GAN, then generate sentences conditioned on \boldsymbol{z}_{y} using the decoder.The baselines are described in Appendix. G-score computes the geometric mean of Accuracy and Bleu, measuring the comprehensive quality of both content and style.Self-Bleu measures the diversity of the generated sentences. The results are shown in Table 6, Optimus achieves the best performance on all metrics.This verifies the importance of learning a smooth and meaningful latent space.The conditional generated sentences are shown in Appendix."
What metric did the authors use to measure generalizability on low-resource language understanding tasks?,The authors used the validation set to measure generalizability on low-resource language understanding tasks,"The main performance metric the authors use to measure generalizability on low resource is the GLUE benchmark. More broadly, the authors explain that their model is suitable for low resource settings to begin with since their model can be specialized at low cost (through feature based approaches) and can function with very little labelled data.","We further consider the GLUE benchmark Wang et al. (2019), which consists of nine datasets for general language understanding.Following the finetuning schedule in Devlin et al. (2019), we use learning rate [2,3,4,5]\times 10^{-5} and train the model for 3 epochs. We select the best performance among different runs. We show the results on the validation set in Table 7.With the feature-based scheme, Optimus yields higher performance than BERT, especially on the large datasets such as MNLI, QQP and QNLI. When the full models are fine-tuned, the two methods perform quite similarly. In summary, the scenarios that Optimus fit the low-resource settings are two-fold: (1) The required computing resource is low: the feature-based approach only updates the classifier, whosecomputing requirement is much lower than full-model fine-tuning; (2) The number of required labelled data is low: when labelled data is rare, Optimus adapts better.The results confirm that Optimus can maintain and exploit the structures learned in pre-training, and presents a more general representation that can be adapted to new tasks more easily than BERT – feature-based adaption is much faster and easier to perform than fine-tuning."
"What does ""smooth feature regularization"" mean?","Smooth feature regularization refers to the regularization term \mathcal{L}_{R} in the VAE objective, which encourages the learned latent space to be smooth and structured, rather than allowing it to become too complex or high-dimensional. This helps the model learn more generalizable features and improves its performance on downstream tasks","The authors do not explicitly define what ""smooth"" means anywhere in the paper, though possible meanings could be interpolated from the author's statements in the papers. The authors mention that the regularization term in Optimus is what helps a basic VAE learn a smooth feature space. They also use t-SNE to visualize learned features, which indicates that ""smooth"" in this context just means cleaner, free-flowing boundaries of the latent space. However, additional information is required to formally define smoothness, which does not seem to be available in the paper.","•AE. Only \mathcal{L}_{E} is considered (\beta=0), while the Gaussian sampling in q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z}|\boldsymbol{x}) remains. In other words, the regularization is removed, and a point-estimate is likely to be learned to represent the text sequence’s latent feature.Note our reconstruction is on sentence-level, while other PLMs Devlin et al. (2019); Yang et al. (2019) employ masked LM loss, performing token-level reconstruction. •VAE. The full VAE objective is considered (\beta>0). It tends to learn a smooth latent space due to \mathcal{L}_{R}. Due to the regularization term \mathcal{L}_{R}, Optimus can organize sentences in the way specified by the prior distribution. For basic VAEs, a smooth feature space is learned, which is specifically beneficial for better generalization when the number of task-specific labeled data is low.To have a fair comparison, we follow the BERT paper, where the hidden feature of [CLS] is used as thesentence-level representation. In this way, the linear classifiers for both models have the same number of trainableparameters. Though the latent vector \boldsymbol{z} is typically used as sentence-level representation in VAE literature, we argue that the KL regularization applied on \boldsymbol{z} has a large impact on the preceding layer feature {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}.Specifically, {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}} is fed into an linear classifier {{\bf W}}_{\text{C}}\in\mathbb{R}^{K\times H}, where K is the number of classes, with objective -\log(\text{softmax}({\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}{{\bf W}}_{\text{C}}^{\top})). Two schemes are used:(\textup{\it i}) Fine-tuning, where both the pre-trained model and the classifier are updated;(\textup{\it ii}) Feature-based, where pre-trained model weights are frozen to provide embeddings for the classifier update. We use tSNE Maaten and Hinton (2008) to visualize the learned feature on a 2D map. The validation set of Yelp is used to extract the latent features.Compared with BERT, Optimus learns a smoother space and more structured latent patterns, which explains why Optimus can yield better classification performance and faster adaptation."
"What is ""KL vanishing"" with respect to VAEs?","KL vanishing refers to the issue in VAEs where the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the approximate posterior and the prior becomes too small during training, leading to a loss of information and poor performance","The authors do not explicitly explain the KL vanishing problem in detail, but they do cite a recent work, Bowman et al. (2016), that probably contains more detailed information on this problem. Additionally, the authors explain that KL regularization is a problem that specifically happens with Variational Autoencoders only (i.e. regular AEs do not seem to have this problem). When explaining how VAEs can be considered to be equivalent to AEs with KL regularization, we see the main difference between AEs and VAEs is the extra KL term added to VAEs. Putting all this information together, one could conclude that ""KL vanishing"" refers to this KL term in a VAE becoming zero during training. The authors list multiple methods (annealing, specialized decoder architectures, auxiliary loss functions, etc) that people in the field have used to prevent this from happening.","There is an alternative interpretation of the ELBO: the VAE objective can be viewed as a regularized version of the autoencoder (AE) Goodfellow et al. (2016).It is thus natural to extend the negative of \mathcal{L}_{\text{ELBO}} in (3) by introducing a hyper-parameter \beta to control the strength of regularization:\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\displaystyle=\mathcal{L}_{E}+\beta\mathcal{L}_{R},~{}~{}\text{with}(4)\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{E}\displaystyle=-\mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z}|\boldsymbol{x})}\big{[}\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{z})\big{]}(5)\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{R}=KL(qϕ(𝒛|𝒙)||p(𝒛))\displaystyle=\mbox{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z}|\boldsymbol{x})||p(\boldsymbol{z}))= KL ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_z | bold_italic_x ) | | italic_p ( bold_italic_z ) )(6)where \mathcal{L}_{E} is the reconstruction error (or negative log-likelihood (NLL)), and \mathcal{L}_{R} is a KL regularizer.The cost function \mathcal{L}_{\beta} provides a unified perspective for understanding various autoencoder variants and training methods. We consider two types of latent space with the following objectives: We train the model parameters \{\boldsymbol{\phi},\boldsymbol{\theta}\} using two objectives: AE and VAE, discussed in Section 4.1. Pre-training AE using  (5) is straightforward. However, pre-training VAE can be challenging due to the notorious KL vanishing issue Bowman et al. (2016), where(\textup{\it i})an encoder that produces posteriors almost identical to the Gaussian prior for all sentences (rather than a more interesting posterior); and(\textup{\it ii})a decoder that completely ignores \boldsymbol{z} in (2), and a learned model that reduces to a simpler NLM.

Transformers Vaswani et al. (2017) are recently considered in VAEs for classification Gururangan et al. (2019) and storytelling Wang and Wan (2019). Pre-training VAEs has been recently considered in conditional text generation to amortize the training of decoders and to allow easy adaptation in new generation tasks Duan et al. (2019)."
"Is ""one-step-ahead conditional"" here mean the same as the modelled probability of calculating the next token?","Yes.

In the context of neural language models, the ""one-step-ahead conditional"" refers to the probability of calculating the next token in a sequence, given the previous tokens. This is the same as the modelled probability of calculating the next token","Yes, ""one-step-ahead conditional"", in this context refers to the calculation of probabilities for what the next token might be, given a sequence of past tokens in a sentence","To generate a text sequence of length T, \boldsymbol{x}=[x_{1},\cdots,x_{T}], neural language models (NLM) Mikolov et al. (2010) generate every token x_{t} conditioned on the previous word tokens:\displaystyle\vspace{-2mm}p(\boldsymbol{x})=\prod_{t=1}^{T}p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(x_{t}|x_{<t}),\vspace{-2mm}(1)where x_{<t} indicates all tokens before t, and \boldsymbol{\theta} is the model parameter.In NLMs, each one-step-ahead conditional in (1) is modeled by an expressive family of neural networks, and is typically trained via maximum likelihood estimate (MLE).Perhaps the most well-known NLM instance is GPT-2 Radford et al. (2019), which employs Transformers Vaswani et al. (2017) for each conditional, and \boldsymbol{\theta} is learned on a huge amount of OpenWeb text corpus. GPT-2 has shown surprisingly realistic text generation results, and low perplexity on several benchmarks. GPT-3 Brown et al. (2020) was recently proposed to further scale up NLMs to 175 billion parameters, showing impressive results on few-shot learning on multiple language tasks."
"Does ""generation"" and ""inference"" here mean the same as ""decoder"" and ""encoder"", respectively?","No.

In the context of VAEs and GPT-2, ""generation"" and ""inference"" refer to different aspects of the model's functionality, whereas ""decoder"" and ""encoder"" refer to specific components of the model.

""Generation"" refers to the process of producing new text, such as in the case of the decoder network generating text given a latent vector.

""Inference"" refers to the process of approximating the true posterior distribution over the latent variables, such as in the case of the inference model or encoder network.

So, while the decoder and encoder are both important components of the VAE and GPT-2 models, they serve different purposes and are not interchangeable with the terms ""generation"" and ""inference""","Yes, in this context, ""generation"" refers to ""decoder"" and ""inference"" refers to encoder.","The generative model (decoder) draws a latent vector \boldsymbol{z} from the continuous latent space with priorp(\boldsymbol{z}), and generates the text sequence \boldsymbol{x} from a conditional distribution p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{z}); p(\boldsymbol{z}) is typically assumed a multivariate Gaussian, and \boldsymbol{\theta} represents the neural network parameters. The following auto-regressive decoding process is usually used:\displaystyle\vspace{-2mm}p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{z})=\prod_{t=1}^{T}p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(x_{t}|x_{<t},\boldsymbol{z}).\vspace{-4mm}(2)Intuitively, VAE provides a “hierachical” generation procedure: \boldsymbol{z}\sim p(\boldsymbol{z}) determines the high-level semantics, followed by (2) to produce the output sentences with low-level syntactic and lexical details. This contrasts with (1) in the explicit dependency on \boldsymbol{z}. Similar to GPT-2, parameters \boldsymbol{\theta} are typically learned by maximizing the marginal log likelihood \log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x})=\log\int p(\boldsymbol{z})p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{z})\mbox{d}\boldsymbol{z}.However, this marginal term is intractable to compute for many decoder choices. Thus, variational inference is considered, and the true posterior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{z}|\boldsymbol{x})\propto p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{z})p(\boldsymbol{z}) is approximated viathe variational distribution q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z}|\boldsymbol{x}) is (often known as the inference model or encoder), implemented via a \boldsymbol{\phi}-parameterized neural network.It yields the evidence lower bound objective (ELBO):\displaystyle\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x})\geq\mathcal{L}_{\text{ELBO}}=(3)𝔼qϕ⁢(𝒛|𝒙)[logp𝜽(𝒙|𝒛)]−KL(qϕ(𝒛|𝒙)||p(𝒛))\displaystyle\mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z}|\boldsymbol{x})}\big{[}\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{z})\big{]}-\mbox{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z}|\boldsymbol{x})||p(\boldsymbol{z}))blackboard_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_z | bold_italic_x ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [ roman_log italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_x | bold_italic_z ) ] - KL ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_z | bold_italic_x ) | | italic_p ( bold_italic_z ) )"
Is the regularization here intended to make sure that the prior distribution is similar to a given distribution like a Gaussian distribution?,"No.

The regularization term \mathcal{L}_{R} in the VAE objective is not intended to make sure that the prior distribution is similar to a given distribution like a Gaussian distribution. Instead, it is a KL regularizer that encourages the latent space to have a specific structure, such as a smooth feature space, which is beneficial for better generalization in tasks with limited labeled data","Yes, regularization is used to ensure that the model, Optimus, can organize sentences in a manner similar to some specified prior distribution. Additionally, authors discuss how the degree of regularization can be controlled through a parameter, beta.","There is an alternative interpretation of the ELBO: the VAE objective can be viewed as a regularized version of the autoencoder (AE) Goodfellow et al. (2016).It is thus natural to extend the negative of \mathcal{L}_{\text{ELBO}} in (3) by introducing a hyper-parameter \beta to control the strength of regularization:\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\displaystyle=\mathcal{L}_{E}+\beta\mathcal{L}_{R},~{}~{}\text{with}(4)\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{E}\displaystyle=-\mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z}|\boldsymbol{x})}\big{[}\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{z})\big{]}(5)\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{R}=KL(qϕ(𝒛|𝒙)||p(𝒛))\displaystyle=\mbox{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z}|\boldsymbol{x})||p(\boldsymbol{z}))= KL ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_z | bold_italic_x ) | | italic_p ( bold_italic_z ) )(6)where \mathcal{L}_{E} is the reconstruction error (or negative log-likelihood (NLL)), and \mathcal{L}_{R} is a KL regularizer.The cost function \mathcal{L}_{\beta} provides a unified perspective for understanding various autoencoder variants and training methods. We consider two types of latent space with the following objectives: Due to the regularization term \mathcal{L}_{R}, Optimus can organize sentences in the way specified by the prior distribution. For basic VAEs, a smooth feature space is learned, which is specifically beneficial for better generalization when the number of task-specific labeled data is low.To have a fair comparison, we follow the BERT paper, where the hidden feature of [CLS] is used as thesentence-level representation. In this way, the linear classifiers for both models have the same number of trainableparameters. Though the latent vector \boldsymbol{z} is typically used as sentence-level representation in VAE literature, we argue that the KL regularization applied on \boldsymbol{z} has a large impact on the preceding layer feature {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}.Specifically, {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}} is fed into an linear classifier {{\bf W}}_{\text{C}}\in\mathbb{R}^{K\times H}, where K is the number of classes, with objective -\log(\text{softmax}({\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}{{\bf W}}_{\text{C}}^{\top})). Two schemes are used:(\textup{\it i}) Fine-tuning, where both the pre-trained model and the classifier are updated;(\textup{\it ii}) Feature-based, where pre-trained model weights are frozen to provide embeddings for the classifier update."
Does this attention mechanism resemble the human attention attitude in the intuition or idea?,"Yes. The attention mechanism in the model resembles the human attention attitude in the intuition or idea, as it is able to learn and exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences, much like how humans attend to different parts of a sentence when understanding its meaning",Yes the attention mechanism resemble to human attention attitude because it can yield more interpretable models which can extract syntactic and semantic structure from sentences.,"As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences."
What are benefits of using learnable parameters for capturing positional information rather than using sines and cosines to capture these positions?,"Using learnable parameters for capturing positional information allows the model to adapt to different sequence lengths and capture more complex positional relationships, whereas using sines and cosines may limit the model's ability to extrapolate to longer sequences",The two choices of Positional encoding are learned and fixed. In the experiments the two versions produced nearly identical results. The fixed sinusoidal positional encoding has the advantage that it can handle the sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.,"Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add ""positional encodings"" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d_{\text{model}} as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed (JonasFaceNet2017, ). We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings (JonasFaceNet2017, ) instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training."
Can't we use parallelization with RNN layers approach with any possible way?,No,Because hidden state of each input position depends on previous hidden state therefore RNN can not be parallelized. Whereas Transformer due to attention layers are highly parallel.,"Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h_{t}, as a function of the previous hidden state h_{t-1} and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks (Kuchaiev2017Factorization, ) and conditional computation (shazeer2017outrageously, ), while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains. As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece (wu2016google, ) and byte-pair (sennrich2015neural, ) representations.To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work. For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles. "
How could restricting self attention to some window with size r be useful with long term dependencies?,"Restricting self-attention to a window with size r can be useful for long-term dependencies by allowing the model to focus on a local neighborhood of the input sequence, reducing the maximum path length and computational complexity, while still capturing long-range dependencies within the window",Restricting self attention to some window with size r does improve computational performance but its effect on long term dependencies have not been explored in the paper.,"As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece (wu2016google, ) and byte-pair (sennrich2015neural, ) representations.To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position.

How would be the results and performance considering accuracy and losses while using window-with-size r self-attention approach with shorter sequences?,"The results and performance using the window-with-size r self-attention approach with shorter sequences would likely be improved, as the increased maximum path length would allow the model to capture longer-range dependencies more effectively",Window-with-size r self-attention approach is only recommended to only improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences.,"As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece (wu2016google, ) and byte-pair (sennrich2015neural, ) representations.To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work."
why would we need to increase learning rate for the first few training steps while we initially use Adam?,"To help the optimizer converge faster.

Increasing the learning rate for the first few training steps allows the optimizer to explore the parameter space more quickly and find a better local minimum. This is especially important when using a gradient-based optimizer like Adam, which relies on the gradient of the loss function to update the parameters. By starting with a higher learning rate, the optimizer can more quickly escape from the initial, poor local minimum and converge to a better one",In adam optimizer learning rate is linearly increased ay startup for the purpose of warmup during training.,"We used the Adam optimizer (kingma2014adam, ) with \beta_{1}=0.9, \beta_{2}=0.98 and \epsilon=10^{-9}. We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula: This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup\_steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup\_steps=4000."
What are the results and performance with no using of label smoothing ?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Without label smoothing, the results and performance are worse than with label smoothing",After applying label smoothing regularization perplexity decreases but the accuracy and BLEU score does improve. This means if we do not apply label smoothing accuracy and BLEU score would be decreased.,"During training, we employed label smoothing of value \epsilon_{ls}=0.1 (DBLP:journals/corr/SzegedyVISW15, ). This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score."
"Can we generalize applying transformers to translate from any language to another rather than English, like German-to-Arabic for example?.","Sure! Yes, we can generalize applying transformers to translate from any language to another, including German-to-Arabic",Since the Transformer performed great on   English-to-French and English-to-German translation tasks and can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers therefore it can be hoped that it can be used for any language other than English.,"On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0, outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P_{drop}=0.1, instead of 0.3. For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers.

In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles. "
Does Conditional Computation have things in common with chain rule between statistical independent variables?,"Yes.

Conditional computation, as described in the context, can be seen as a form of chain rule for independent variables, where the computation of each hidden state is conditioned on the previous hidden state and the input for that position. This allows the model to factorize the computation and improve efficiency, similar to how the chain rule can be used to decompose complex computations into simpler ones",Yes as the chain rule has a sequence of computations similarly conditional computation method is also sequential.,"Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h_{t}, as a function of the previous hidden state h_{t-1} and the input for position t.

what is the definition of BLEU?,"BLEU stands for ""Bilingual Evaluation Understudy"" and it is a metric used to evaluate the quality of machine translation","BLEU score is the metric to compute performance of the language translation task.  On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, big transformer model establishes a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. BLUE score also drops with single head or too many heads.","On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4.

In Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads."
Does Conditional Computation mentioned by the authors mean to perform operations depending on the need to perform them?,Yes,Paper only mention the advantages of conditional computation that is to improve computational efficiency and model performance.,"Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences.

Do conv Nets succeed in sequence modelling in general?,"No, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do not generally succeed in sequence modeling. While CNNs can be used for sequence modeling tasks, they have limitations in terms of computational complexity and ability to learn long-range dependencies",Conv Nets can compute the hidden state of the sequence data in parallel for all input and output positions. However conv nets are still more expensive than the recurrent networks.,"A single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O(log_{k}(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions (NalBytenet2017, ), increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network.Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions (xception2016, ), however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O(k\cdot n\cdot d+n\cdot d^{2}). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model. The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU (extendedngpu, ), ByteNet (NalBytenet2017, ) and ConvS2S (JonasFaceNet2017, ), all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions (hochreiter2001gradient, ). In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2."
How could reducing the number of operations into constant result in decreasing resolution ?,"The number of operations is reduced at the cost of averaging attention-weighted positions, which leads to a decrease in effective resolution",The resolution  is decreased due to averaging in the attention position with Multi-Head Attention.,"Instead of performing a single attention function with d_{\text{model}}-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d_{k}, d_{k} and d_{v} dimensions, respectively.On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d_{v}-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2. The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU (extendedngpu, ), ByteNet (NalBytenet2017, ) and ConvS2S (JonasFaceNet2017, ), all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions.

"Is it crucial to use 6 layers in the encoder? if it is free to change, Does increasing those layers need more data to avoid overfitting or just would take longer time to converge?","No, it is not crucial to use 6 layers in the encoder. Increasing the number of layers can potentially improve the model's performance, but it may also lead to overfitting or longer training times. The optimal number of layers depends on the specific task and dataset, and should be determined through experimentation",For translation tasks the result shows that 6 layers are the optimal number of layers.,"The encoder is composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection (he2016deep, ) around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization layernorm2016 . That is, the output of each sub-layer is \mathrm{LayerNorm}(x+\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)), where \mathrm{Sublayer}(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d_{\text{model}}=512. The decoder is also composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i."
Why -while having data of next positions in training dataset- is it important to modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to ensure that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than ?,To prevent leftward information flow in the decoder and preserve the auto-regressive property,Self attention layer in transformer is modified in decoder stack to attend only the past predictions to preserve the auto-regressive property in the language models.,"The decoder is also composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.

This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i. The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:•In ""encoder-decoder attention"" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as (wu2016google, ; bahdanau2014neural, ; JonasFaceNet2017, ).•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -\infty) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2."
What is Attention Function?How is it calculated?,"Attention Function is a mechanism that computes a weighted sum of values based on the compatibility between a query and a set of key-value pairs.

Calculation: The compatibility function is computed using a dot-product or additive attention mechanism, where the weights are computed as the dot product or sum of the query and key vectors, scaled by a scaling factor. The output is a weighted sum of the values, where the weights are the computed compatibility values",Attention function relates different positions of the sequence to get the overall representation of the sequence. It can be computer by additive attention method or the dot-product method. Attention have been successfully applied in various NLP tasks such as reading comprehensions and summarizations.,"An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention (bahdanau2014neural, ), and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations (cheng2016long, ; decomposableAttnModel, ; paulus2017deep, ; lin2017structured, )."
"What are similarities and differences between Key, Value, and Query?","Sure! Here's my answer:

Similarities:

* All are vectors
* All are used in the attention function

Differences:

* Key and Value represent the input data, while Query represents the context
* The compatibility function computes the weight for each Value based on its similarity with the Query","Key, Value and Query are all vectors, All are used to compute attention. Queries are mapped to a pair of key and value during attention computations.","An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

What is the Difference Between Additive and Multiplicative Attention?,"Additive attention uses a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer to compute the compatibility function, while multiplicative attention (also known as dot-product attention) uses dot products with a scaling factor of 1/√d_k",Dot product attention is calculated using optimized matrix multiplication  operations whereas Additive attention is computed by compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. Multiplicative Attention is much faster and more space-efficient than the additive attention.,"The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention (bahdanau2014neural, ), and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}.

While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. While for small values of d_{k} the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d_{k} (DBLP:journals/corr/BritzGLL17, ). We suspect that for large values of d_{k}, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 111To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q\cdot k=\sum_{i=1}^{d_{k}}q_{i}k_{i}, has mean 0 and variance d_{k}.. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}."
Shouldn't the inputs in the decoder updated while training after initially setting them to -inf ?,"Yes.

In training the decoder, it is common to initialize the input embeddings with negative infinity values, as you mentioned. However, as training progresses, these inputs should be updated based on the generated output symbols. This is because the decoder's output is used as input to the encoder, which in turn affects the decoder's input. Updating the inputs during training helps the model learn the dependencies between the output symbols and the input sequence, leading to better performance","Transformer decoder generates an output sequence (y_{1},...,y_{m}) of symbols one element at a time by using the encoder information. Its input is the shifted target sequence and not the -inf","Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure (cho2014learning, ; bahdanau2014neural, ; sutskever14, ). Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x_{1},...,x_{n}) to a sequence of continuous representations \mathbf{z}=(z_{1},...,z_{n}). Given \mathbf{z}, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y_{1},...,y_{m}) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive (graves2013generating, ), consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next."
How should positional information be interpreted or captured with sines and cosines?,Positional information should be interpreted as a geometric progression of sinusoidal waves with wavelengths ranging from 2π to 10000π,Positional encoding can be generated using sinusoidal function whose wavelengths form a geometric progression which can encode relative positions. Advantage of the sinusoidal positional encoding is that it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.,"where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2\pi to 10000\cdot 2\pi. We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PE_{pos+k} can be represented as a linear function of PE_{pos}. We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings (JonasFaceNet2017, ) instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training."
Do we care in general for resolution while modelling language?,No,As the transformers are used for language modeling there is a resolution problem due to averaging in attention weights. This problem is reduced by using the multiheaded attention.,"The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2."
"Does the statement ""At each step the model is auto-regressive, consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next"" implies that we can use attention in handling time series forecasting?","Yes. The use of auto-regression in the decoder, which consumes previously generated symbols as additional input, is a form of attention that allows the model to capture long-term dependencies in the input sequence. This is particularly useful in time series forecasting tasks, where the model needs to consider the entire history of the time series when making predictions",Attention can be used for sequence modeling and can be used to build encoder decoder models which can handle time series forecasting.,"In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention. Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure (cho2014learning, ; bahdanau2014neural, ; sutskever14, ). Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x_{1},...,x_{n}) to a sequence of continuous representations \mathbf{z}=(z_{1},...,z_{n}).

At each step the model is auto-regressive (graves2013generating, ), consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next."
"What is space meant in ""space-efficient in practice"" ?Does it mean space of search for solutions? or space in memory?",Space in memory,Dot product attention is much faster and more space-efficient than the additive attention. Here the space efficient is referring to the less memory space.,"The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code."
Is task-independent sentence representations same thing as embedding?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

No.

Task-independent sentence representations are a type of representation that can be learned by a model to capture the meaning of sentences in a way that is not specific to any particular task or dataset. Embeddings, on the other hand, are a type of vector representation that maps words or sentences to a dense vector space, where similar words or sentences are close together in the vector space. While embeddings can be used for a variety of tasks, they are not necessarily task-independent, as the same embedding space may be used for different tasks",Task-independent sentence representations learns text embedding and can be implemented efficiently using self-attention.,"Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22]."
What are the two factors the Mobilenet hyperparameters will affect?,"The two factors that the MobileNet hyperparameters (width multiplier and resolution multiplier) will affect are:

1. Network width
2. Network latency",MobileNet architecture introduces two hyper-parameters;  width multiplier and resolution multiplier.,"This paper describes an efficient network architecture and a set of two hyper-parameters in order to build very small, low latency models that can be easily matched to the design requirements for mobile and embedded vision applications. Section 2 reviews prior work in building small models. Section 3 describes the MobileNet architecture and two hyper-parameters width multiplier and resolution multiplier to define smaller and more efficient MobileNets. Section 4 describes experiments on ImageNet as well a variety of different applications and use cases. Section 5 closes with a summary and conclusion. Although the base MobileNet architecture is already small and low latency, many times a specific use case or application may require the model to be smaller and faster. In order to construct these smaller and less computationally expensive models we introduce a very simple parameter \alpha called width multiplier. The role of the width multiplier \alpha is to thin a network uniformly at each layer. For a given layer and width multiplier \alpha, the number of input channels M becomes \alpha M and the number of output channels N becomes \alpha N. In this section we first investigate the effects of depthwise convolutions as well as the choice of shrinking by reducing the width of the network rather than the number of layers. We then show the trade offs of reducing the network based on the two hyper-parameters: width multiplier and resolution multiplier and compare results to a number of popular models. We then investigate MobileNets applied to a number of different applications. In this section we first describe the core layers that MobileNet is built on which are depthwise separable filters. We then describe the MobileNet network structure and conclude with descriptions of the two model shrinking hyper-parameters width multiplier and resolution multiplier."
What are the fields that needs to be carried out in a timely fashion and on a computationally limited platform?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Robotics, self-driving cars, and augmented reality","For robotics, self-driving cars and AR, the recognition task needs to be carried timely and with less computational cost.","Convolutional neural networks have become ubiquitous in computer vision ever since AlexNet [19] popularized deep convolutional neural networks by winning the ImageNet Challenge: ILSVRC 2012 [24]. The general trend has been to make deeper and more complicated networks in order to achieve higher accuracy [27, 31, 29, 8]. However, these advances to improve accuracy are not necessarily making networks more efficient with respect to size and speed. In many real world applications such as robotics, self-driving car and augmented reality, the recognition tasks need to be carried out in a timely fashion on a computationally limited platform."
What are MobileNets are primarily built on and what is it main goal?,"MobileNets are primarily built on depthwise separable convolutions and are designed to optimize for latency, yielding small and efficient models","MobileNets are built primarily on depthwise separable convolutions, a specialized method which reduces the computational cost. The main goal for MobileNets to design an efficient architecture is to reduce latency while maintaining state of the art accuracy.","This paper describes an efficient network architecture and a set of two hyper-parameters in order to build very small, low latency models that can be easily matched to the design requirements for mobile and embedded vision applications. Section 2 reviews prior work in building small models. Section 3 describes the MobileNet architecture and two hyper-parameters width multiplier and resolution multiplier to define smaller and more efficient MobileNets. Section 4 describes experiments on ImageNet as well a variety of different applications and use cases. Section 5 closes with a summary and conclusion. There has been rising interest in building small and efficient neural networks in the recent literature, e.g. [16, 34, 12, 36, 22]. Many different approaches can be generally categorized into either compressing pretrained networks or training small networks directly. This paper proposes a class of network architectures that allows a model developer to specifically choose a small network that matches the resource restrictions (latency, size) for their application. MobileNets primarily focus on optimizing for latency but also yield small networks. Many papers on small networks focus only on size but do not consider speed. MobileNets are built primarily from depthwise separable convolutions initially introduced in [26] and subsequently used in Inception models [13] to reduce the computation in the first few layers. Flattened networks [16] build a network out of fully factorized convolutions and showed the potential of extremely factorized networks. Independent of this current paper, Factorized Networks[34] introduces a similar factorized convolution as well as the use of topological connections. Subsequently, the Xception network [3] demonstrated how to scale up depthwise separable filters to out perform Inception V3 networks. Another small network is Squeezenet [12] which uses a bottleneck approach to design a very small network. Other reduced computation networks include structured transform networks [28] and deep fried convnets [37]."
What is distillation and why it is used?,Distillation is a knowledge transfer technique for deep networks that enables training from large unlabeled datasets by emulating the outputs of a larger model. It is used to reduce the size of a large face attribute classifier with unknown or esoteric training procedures,Distillation is a knowledge transfer technique for deep networks which is used for compute efficient model design.,"Another use-case for MobileNet is compressing large systems with unknown or esoteric training procedures. In a face attribute classification task, we demonstrate a synergistic relationship between MobileNet and distillation [9], a knowledge transfer technique for deep networks. We seek to reduce a large face attribute classifier with 75 million parameters and 1600 million Mult-Adds. The classifier is trained on a multi-attribute dataset similar to YFCC100M [32]. We distill a face attribute classifier using the MobileNet architecture. Distillation [9] works by training the classifier to emulate the outputs of a larger model222The emulation quality is measured by averaging the per-attribute cross-entropy over all attributes. instead of the ground-truth labels, hence enabling training from large (and potentially infinite) unlabeled datasets. Marrying the scalability of distillation training and the parsimonious parameterization of MobileNet, the end system not only requires no regularization (e.g. weight-decay and early-stopping), but also demonstrates enhanced performances. It is evident from Tab. 12 that the MobileNet-based classifier is resilient to aggressive model shrinking: it achieves a similar mean average precision across attributes (mean AP) as the in-house while consuming only 1\% the Multi-Adds."
What is a depthwise separable convolution means?,A depthwise separable convolution is a way of factorizing a standard convolution into two separate layers: a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution. It reduces computation and model size by separating the filtering and combining steps into two separate layers,Depthwise separable convolution is made up of two layers: depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions where depthwise convolutions apply a single filter per each input channel and a Pointwise convolution creates a linear combination of the output of the depthwise layer.,"The standard convolution operation has the effect of filtering features based on theconvolutional kernels and combining features in order to produce a new representation.The filtering and combination steps can be split into two steps via the use offactorized convolutions called depthwise separable convolutions for substantial reduction in computational cost. Depthwise separable convolution are made up of two layers: depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions.We use depthwise convolutions to apply a single filter per each input channel (input depth). Pointwise convolution, asimple 1\times 1 convolution, is then used to create a linear combination of the output of the depthwise layer. MobileNets use bothbatchnorm and ReLU nonlinearities for both layers. Depthwise convolution is extremely efficient relative to standard convolution. However it only filters input channels, it does not combine them to create new features. So an additional layer that computes a linear combination of the output of depthwise convolution via 1\times 1 convolution is needed in order to generate these new features. The combination of depthwise convolution and 1\times 1 (pointwise) convolution is called depthwise separable convolution which was originally introduced in [26]. The MobileNet model is based on depthwise separable convolutions which is a form of factorized convolutions which factorize a standard convolution into a depthwise convolution and a 1\times 1 convolution called a pointwise convolution. For MobileNets the depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel. The pointwise convolution then applies a 1\times 1 convolution to combine the outputs the depthwise convolution. A standard convolution both filters and combines inputs into a new set of outputs in one step. The depthwise separable convolution splits this into two layers, a separate layer for filtering and a separate layer for combining. This factorization has the effect of drastically reducing computation and model size. Figure 2 shows how a standard convolution 2(a) is factorized into a depthwise convolution 2(b) and a 1\times 1 pointwise convolution 2(c)."

What is the computational cost of the standard convolutions and what does it depends on?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The computational cost of standard convolutions in MobileNet models depends multiplicatively on the number of input channels, the number of output channels, and the kernel size","Standard convolutions have the computational cost of: D_{K}\cdot D_{K}\cdot M\cdot N\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F} where the computational cost depends multiplicatively on the number of input channels M, the number of output channels N the kernel size D_{k}\times D_{k} and the feature map size D_{F}\times D_{F}.","D_{K}\cdot D_{K}\cdot M\cdot N\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F}(2)where the computational cost depends multiplicatively on the number of input channels M, the number of output channels N the kernel size D_{k}\times D_{k} and the feature map size D_{F}\times D_{F}. MobileNet models address each of these terms and their interactions. First it uses depthwise separable convolutions to break the interaction between the number of output channels and the size of the kernel."
What are the layers of depthwise separable convolution and discuss the function of each of them.,"The layers of depthwise separable convolution are:

1. Depthwise convolution: Applies a single filter to each input channel, performing a spatial filtering operation.
2. Pointwise convolution: Applies a 1x1 convolution to combine the outputs of the depthwise convolution, creating a linear combination of the filtered features.

The depthwise convolution filters each input channel separately, while the pointwise convolution combines the output of the depthwise convolution into a single output feature map. This factorization reduces computation and model size, making it a key component of MobileNets",Depthwise separable convolutions have two layers—depthwise and pointwise. Depthwise convolutions apply one filter per input channel (input depth). The depthwise layer output is linearly combined using pointwise convolution which is a 1\times 1 convolution.,"Depthwise separable convolution are made up of two layers: depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions.We use depthwise convolutions to apply a single filter per each input channel (input depth).

The MobileNet structure is built on depthwise separable convolutions as mentioned in the previous section except for the first layer which is a full convolution. By defining the network in such simple terms we are able to easily explore network topologies to find a good network. The MobileNet architecture is defined in Table 1. All layers are followed by a batchnorm [13] and ReLU nonlinearity with the exception of the final fully connected layer which has no nonlinearity and feeds into a softmax layer for classification. Figure 3 contrasts a layer with regular convolutions, batchnorm and ReLU nonlinearity to the factorized layer with depthwise convolution, 1\times 1 pointwise convolution as well as batchnorm and ReLU after each convolutional layer.

Does all the layers of the MobileNet use depthwise separable convolution?,"No, not all layers in MobileNet use depthwise separable convolutions.

How the MobileNet model was trained and why it was different than training the large networks?,"MobileNet models were trained with less regularization and data augmentation techniques compared to large networks like Inception V3, and with no weight decay on the depthwise filters.

Authors avoid side heads and label smoothing when training and limit the size of small crops to reduce image distortions Also, depthwise filters needed little or no weight decay. While all these things are common practices for large datasets, this is redundant for MobileNets.","MobileNet models were trained in TensorFlow [1] using RMSprop [33] with asynchronous gradient descent similar to Inception V3 [31]. However, contrary to training large models we use less regularization and data augmentation techniques because small models have less trouble with overfitting. When training MobileNets we do not use side heads or label smoothing and additionally reduce the amount image of distortions by limiting the size of small crops that are used in large Inception training [31]. Additionally, we found that it was important to put very little or no weight decay (l2 regularization) on the depthwise filters since their are so few parameters in them. For the ImageNet benchmarks in the next section all models were trained with same training parameters regardless of the size of the model."

Compare between the results of mobile net and full convolutions on the ImageNet dataset,"Sure! Here's my answer:

MobileNet with depthwise separable convolutions has only 1% less accuracy than a model built with full convolutions on the ImageNet dataset, but it saves tremendously on mult-adds and parameters",Depthwise separable convolutions reduced ImageNet accuracy by 1±% while saving considerable multiplication addition and model parameters.,First we show results for MobileNet with depthwise separable convolutions compared to a model built with full convolutions.

The MobileNet model has only 13 million parameters with the usual 3 million for the body and 10 million for the final layer and 0.58 Million mult-adds. As shown in Tab. 11, the MobileNet version delivers only slightly decreased performance compared to PlaNet despite being much more compact. Moreover, it still outperforms Im2GPS by a large margin. MobileNet can also be deployed as an effective base network in modern object detection systems.We report results for MobileNet trained for object detection on COCO data based on the recent work that won the 2016 COCO challenge [10].In table 13, MobileNet is compared to VGG and Inception V2 [13] under both Faster-RCNN [23] and SSD [21] framework.In our experiments, SSD is evaluated with 300 input resolution (SSD 300) and Faster-RCNN is compared with both 300 and 600 input resolution (Faster-RCNN 300, Faster-RCNN 600).The Faster-RCNN model evaluates 300 RPN proposal boxes per image. The models are trained on COCO train+val excluding 8k minival images and evaluated on minival.For both frameworks, MobileNet achieves comparable results to other networks with only a fraction of computational complexity and model size. We proposed a new model architecture called MobileNets based on depthwise separable convolutions. We investigated some of the important design decisions leading to an efficient model. We then demonstrated how to build smaller and faster MobileNets using width multiplier and resolution multiplier by trading off a reasonable amount of accuracy to reduce size and latency. We then compared different MobileNets to popular models demonstrating superior size, speed and accuracy characteristics. We concluded by demonstrating MobileNet’s effectiveness when applied to a wide variety of tasks. As a next step to help adoption and exploration of MobileNets, we plan on releasing models in Tensor Flow."
What are the reasons for the remarkable progress in the image recognition task? ,"The availability of large-scale annotated datasets, such as ImageNet, and the revival of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have driven the remarkable progress in image recognition","The authors cite the increases in the number of well-constructed large-scale datasets and the usage of CNNs as the main reasons for the progress in the field of image recognition. Well-constructed large-scale datasets facilitate better learning, and the CNN architecture is appropriate for learning informative features from images.","Tremendous progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets (i.e. ImageNet [1, 2]) and the recent revival of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) [3, 4].For data-driven learning, large-scale well-annotated datasets with representative data distribution characteristics are crucial to learning more accurate or generalizable models [5, 4].Unlike previous image datasets used in computer vision, ImageNet [1] offers a very comprehensive database of more than 1.2 million categorized natural images of 1000+ classes.The CNN models trained upon this database serve as the backbone for significantly improving many object detection and image segmentation problems using other datasets [6, 7], e.g., PASCAL [8] and medical image categorization [9, 10, 11, 12].However, there exists no large-scale annotated medical image dataset comparable to ImageNet, as data acquisition is difficult, and quality annotation is costly."
Give examples of two techniques of employing CNNs to medical image,"Sure! Here are two techniques for employing CNNs in medical image analysis, based on the provided context:

1. Using ""off-the-shelf"" CNN features as complementary information channels to existing hand-crafted image features, as demonstrated in [10] and [9] for Chest X-rays and CT lung nodule identification.
2. Performing unsupervised pre-training on natural or medical images and fine-tuning on medical target images using CNN or other types of deep learning models, as shown in [18, 19, 20, 21]","There are three main techniques that are used to apply CNNs to tasks involving medical images: 1) training from scratch, 2) using pre-trained CNNs as feature extractors, then using those features with hand-crafted features, and 3) performing unsupervised pre-training then using CNN for fine-tuning. An example of the ""training from scratch"" technique for employing CNNs to medical images is a CNN that was trained from scratch for LN detection. An example of the ""CNN fine-tuning"" technique is a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet that was used for X-ray and CT images for chest pathology identification and detection.","There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: 1) training the “CNN from scratch” [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]; 2) using “off-the-shelf CNN” features (without retraining the CNN) as complementary information channels to existing hand-crafted image features, for Chest X-rays [10] and CT lung nodule identification [9, 12]; and 3) performing unsupervised pre-training on natural or medical images and fine-tuning on medical target images using CNN or other types of deep learning models [18, 19, 20, 21].A decompositional 2.5D view resampling and an aggregation of random view classification scores are used to eliminate the “curse-of-dimensionality” issue in [22], in order to acquire a sufficient number of training image samples. Although natural images and medical images differ significantly, conventional image descriptors developed for object recognition in natural images, such as the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) [30] and the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) [31], have been widely used for object detection and segmentation in medical image analysis. Recently, ImageNet pre-trained CNNs have been used for chest pathology identification and detection in X-ray and CT modalities [10, 9, 12].They have yielded the best performance results by integrating low-level image features (e.g., GIST [32], bag of visual words (BoVW) and bag-of-frequency [12]). However, the fine-tuning of an ImageNet pre-trained CNN model on medical image datasets has not yet been exploited. Until the detection aggregation approach [22], [41], thoracoabdominal lymph node (LN) detection via CADe mechanisms has yielded poor performance results. In [22], each 3D LN candidate produces up to 100 random 2.5D orthogonally sampled images or views which are then used to train an effective CNN model. The best performance on abdominal LN detection is achieved at 83% recall on 3FP per patient [22], using a “Cifar-10” CNN. Using the thoracoabdominal LN detection datasets [22], we aim to surpass this CADe performance level, by testing different CNN architectures, exploring various dataset re-sampling protocols, and applying transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained CNN models."

We further verify our hypothesis by inheriting and adapting rich hierarchical image features [5, 33] from the large-scale ImageNet dataset for computer aided diagnosis (CAD). We also explore CNN architectures of the most studied seven-layered “AlexNet-CNN” [4], a shallower “Cifar-CNN” [22], and a much deeper version of “GoogLeNet-CNN” [33] (with our modifications on CNN structures). This study is partially motivated by recent studies [34, 35] in computer vision. The thorough quantitative analysis and evaluation on deep CNN [34] or sparsity image coding methods [35] elucidate the emerging techniques of the time and provide useful suggestions for their future stages of development, respectively."
What is the number of images and classes does the ImageNet dataset have?,ImageNet dataset has 1.2 million images and 1000 classes,ImageNet has more than 1.2 million images and about 1000 classes.,"Tremendous progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets (i.e. ImageNet [1, 2]) and the recent revival of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) [3, 4].For data-driven learning, large-scale well-annotated datasets with representative data distribution characteristics are crucial to learning more accurate or generalizable models [5, 4].Unlike previous image datasets used in computer vision, ImageNet [1] offers a very comprehensive database of more than 1.2 million categorized natural images of 1000+ classes.The CNN models trained upon this database serve as the backbone for significantly improving many object detection and image segmentation problems using other datasets [6, 7], e.g., PASCAL [8] and medical image categorization [9, 10, 11, 12].However, there exists no large-scale annotated medical image dataset comparable to ImageNet, as data acquisition is difficult, and quality annotation is costly. The AlexNet architecture was published in [4], achieved significantly improved performance over the other non-deep learning methods for ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012.This success has revived the interest in CNNs [3] in computer vision.ImageNet consists of 1.2 million 256\times 256 images belonging to 1000 categories.At times, the objects in the image are small and obscure, and thus pose more challenges for learning a successful classification model.More details about the ImageNet dataset will be discussed in Sec. III-B.AlexNet has five convolution layers, three pooling layers, and two fully-connected layers with approximately 60 million free parameters.AlexNet is our default CNN architecture for evaluation and analysis in the remainder of the paper. ImageNet [1] has more than 1.2 million 256\times 256 images categorized under 1000 object class categories.There are more than 1000 training images per class.The database is organized according to the WordNet [55] hierarchy, which currently contains only nouns in 1000 object categories.The image-object labels are obtained largely through crowd-sourcing, e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk, and human inspection.Some examples of object categories in ImageNet are “sea snake”, “sandwich”, “vase”, “leopard”, etc.ImageNet is currently the largest image dataset among other standard datasets for visual recognition.Indeed, the Caltech101, Caltech256 and Cifar10 dataset merely contain 60000 32\times 32 images and 10 object classes.Furthermore, due to the large number (1000+) of object classes, the objects belonging to each ImageNet class category can be occluded, partial and small, relative to those in the previous public image datasets.This significant intra-class variation poses greater challenges to any data-driven learning system that builds a classifier to fit given data and generalize to unseen data.For comparison, some example images of Cifar10 dataset and ImageNet images in the “tennis ball” class category are shown in Figure 7.The ImageNet dataset is publicly available, and the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) has become the standard benchmark for large-scale object recognition."

What are the CNN architectures that were explored in this paper?,"The CNN architectures explored in this paper are CifarNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet","The paper uses AlexNet, CifarNet, and GoogLeNet with various numbers of parameters.","We mainly explore three convolutional neural network architectures (CifarNet [5, 22], AlexNet [4] and GoogLeNet [33]) with different model training parameter values.The current deep learning models [22, 52, 53] in medical image tasks are at least 2\sim 5 orders of magnitude smaller than even AlexNet [4].More complex CNN models [22, 52] have only about 150K or 15K parameters.Roth et al. [22] adopt the CNN architecture tailored to the Cifar-10 dataset [5] and operate on image windows of 32\times 32\times 3 pixels for lymph node detection, while the simplest CNN in [54] has only one convolutional, pooling, and FC layer, respectively. We use CifarNet [5] as used in [22] as a baseline for the LN detection.AlexNet [4] and GoogLeNet [33] are also modified to evaluate these state-of-the-art CNN architecture from ImageNet classification task [2] to our CADe problems and datasets.A simplified illustration of three CNN architectures exploited is shown in Figure 5.CifarNet always takes 32\times 32\times 3 image patches as input while AlexNet and GoogLeNet are originally designed for the fixed image dimension of 256\times 256\times 3 pixels.We also reduced the filter size, stride and pooling parameters of AlexNet and GoogLeNet to accommodate a smaller input size of 64\times 64\times 3 pixels.We do so to produce and evaluate “simplified” AlexNet and GoogLeNet versions that are better suited to the smaller scale training datasets common in CADe problems.Throughout the paper, we refer to the models as CifarNet (32x32) or CifarNet (dropping 32x32); AlexNet (256x256) or AlexNet-H (high resolution); AlexNet (64x64) or AlexNet-L (low resolution); GoogLeNet (256x256) or GoogLeNet-H and GoogLeNet (64x64) or GoogLeNet-L (dropping 3 since all image inputs are three channels). The AlexNet architecture was published in [4], achieved significantly improved performance over the other non-deep learning methods for ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012.This success has revived the interest in CNNs [3] in computer vision.ImageNet consists of 1.2 million 256\times 256 images belonging to 1000 categories.At times, the objects in the image are small and obscure, and thus pose more challenges for learning a successful classification model.More details about the ImageNet dataset will be discussed in Sec. III-B.AlexNet has five convolution layers, three pooling layers, and two fully-connected layers with approximately 60 million free parameters.AlexNet is our default CNN architecture for evaluation and analysis in the remainder of the paper. In this section, we evaluate and compare the performances of nine CNN model configurations (CifarNet, AlexNet-ImNet,AlexNet-RI-H, AlexNet-TL-H, AlexNet-RI-L, GoogLeNet-RI-H, GoogLeNet-TL-H, GoogLeNet-RI-L and combined) on two important CADe problems using publicly available datasets [22, 41, 37].

GoogLeNet is the state-of-the-art deep model, which has outperformed other notable models, such as AlexNet, OverFeat, and VGGNet [67, 68] in various computer vision benchmarks. Likewise, a reasonable assumption is that OverFeat and VGGNet may generate quantitative performance results ranked between AlexNet’s and GoogLeNet’s. For completeness, we include the Overfeat and VGGNet in the following evaluations, to bolster our hypothesis."
What are the computer-aided detection problems studied in this paper?,Thoraco-abdominal lymph node detection and interstitial lung disease classification,The paper studies thoraco-abdominal lymph node detection and interstitial lung disease classification.,"Two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification are studied in this work. On mediastinal LN detection, we surpass all currently reported results.We obtain 86\% sensitivity on 3 false positives (FP) per patient, versus the prior state-of-art sensitivities of 78\% [36] (stacked shallow learning) and 70\% [22] (CNN), as prior state-of-the-art. For the first time, ILD classification results under the patient-level five-fold cross-validation protocol (CV5) are investigated and reported. The ILD dataset [37] contains 905 annotated image slices with 120 patients and 6 ILD labels. Such sparsely annotated datasets are generally difficult for CNN learning, due to the paucity of labeled instances. In this paper, we exploit and extensively evaluate three important, previously under-studied factors on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture, dataset characteristics, and transfer learning.We evaluate CNN performance on two different computer-aided diagnosis applications: thoraco-abdominal lymph node detection and interstitial lung disease classification.The empirical evaluation, CNN model visualization, CNN performance analysis, and conclusive insights can be generalized to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks. Until the detection aggregation approach [22, 41], thoracoabdominal lymph node (LN) detection via CADe mechanisms has yielded poor performance results. In [22], each 3D LN candidate produces up to 100 random 2.5D orthogonally sampled images or views which are then used to train an effective CNN model. The best performance on abdominal LN detection is achieved at 83\% recall on 3FP per patient [22], using a “Cifar-10” CNN.

What are the reasons and goals behind image sampling ?,"To balance the data sample number or scale per class, eliminate the ""curse-of-dimensionality"" issue, and reduce the impact of class imbalance","Image sampling is useful for data augmentation to create larger datasets for training, and can also be used to balance the number of data per class during the data augmentation process.","There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: 1) training the “CNN from scratch” [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]; 2) using “off-the-shelf CNN” features (without retraining the CNN) as complementary information channels to existing hand-crafted image features, for Chest X-rays [10] and CT lung nodule identification [9, 12]; and 3) performing unsupervised pre-training on natural or medical images and fine-tuning on medical target images using CNN or other types of deep learning models [18, 19, 20, 21].A decompositional 2.5D view resampling and an aggregation of random view classification scores are used to eliminate the “curse-of-dimensionality” issue in [22], in order to acquire a sufficient number of training image samples. Medical datasets are often “biased”, in that the number of healthy samples is much larger than the number of diseased instances, or that the numbers of images per class are uneven. In ILD dataset, the number of fibrosis samples is about 3.5 times greater than the number of emphysema samples. The number of non-LNs is 3\sim 4 times greater than the number of LNs in lymph node detection. Different sampling or resampling rates are routinely applied to both ILD and LN detection to balance the data sample number or scale per class, as in[22]. We refer this as “Equal Prior”. If we use the same sampling rate, that will lead to a “Biased Prior” across different classes. Evaluation protocols and details are critical to deriving significant empirical findings [34].Our experimental results suggest that different CNN architectures and dataset re-sampling protocols are critical for the LN detection tasks where the amount of labeled training data is sufficient and spatial contexts are local.Since LN images are more flexible than ILD images with respect to resampling and reformatting, LN datasets may be more readily augmented by such image transformations. As a result, LN datasets contain more training and testing data instances (due to data auugmentation) than ILD datasets. They nonetheless remain less comprehensive than natural image datasets, such as ImageNet.Fine-tuning ImageNet-trained models for ILD classification is clearly advantageous and yields early promising results, when the amount of labeled training data is highly insufficient and multi-class categorization is used, as opposed to the LN dataset’s binary class categorization.Another significant finding is that CNNs trained from scratch or fine-tuned from ImageNet models consistently outperform CNNs that merely use off-the-shelf CNN features, in both the LN and ILD classification problems. We further analyze, via CNN activation visualizations, when and why transfer learning from non-medical to medical images in CADe problems can be valuable."
What are the difference between lymph nodes and the hear or liver?,Lymph nodes do not have a pre-determined anatomic orientation like the heart or liver,"Lymph nodes have no predetermined orientation relative to the human anatomy, while the heart and liver do.","Unlike the heart or the liver, lymph nodes have no pre-determined anatomic orientation. Hence, the purely random image resampling (with respect to scale, displacement and orientation) and reformatting (the axial, coronal, and sagittal views are in any system randomly resampled coordinates) is a natural choice, which also happens to yield high CNN performance. Although we integrate three channels of information from three orthogonal views for LN detection, the pixel-wise spatial correlations between or among channels are not necessary. The convolutional kernels in the lower level CNN architectures can learn the optimal weights to linearly combine the observations from the axial, coronal, and sagittal channels by computing their dot-products.Transforming axial, coronal, and sagittal representations to RGB also facilitates transfer learning from CNN models trained on ImageNet."

How many images did the dataset consist of and the number of unique patients ?,"Sure! Based on the context you provided, the answer to your question is:

It contains 905 image slices from 120 patients, with six lung tissue types annotations containing at least one of the following: healthy (NM), emphysema (EM), ground glass (GG), fibrosis (FB), micronodules (MN) and consolidation (CD) (Figure 3).At the slice level, the objective is to classify the status of “presence/absence” of any of the six ILD classes for an input axial CT slice [40].Characterizing an arbitrary CT slice against any possible ILD type, without any manual ROI (in contrast to [38, 39]), can be useful for large-scale patient screening.For slice-level ILD classification, we sampled the slices 12 times with random translations and rotations.After this, we balanced the numbers of CT slice samples for the six classes by randomly sampling several instances at various rates.For patch-based classification, we sampled up to 100 patches of size 64\times 64 from each ROI.This dataset is divided into five folds with disjoint patient subsets.The average number of CT slices (training instances) per fold is small, as shown in Table I.Slice-level ILD classification is a very challenging task where CNN models need to learn from very small numbers of training examples and predict ILD labels on unseen patients."

How did the authors leverage the CNN architectures designed for color images and to transfer CNN parameters pre-trained on ImageNet to be able to use it on the medical dataset ?,"The authors transformed the gray-scale CT images into RGB channels to align with the input channels of pre-trained CNN models, and used different CT windowing channels to improve classification results, without relying on lung segmentation","The authors transformed every gray-scale axial CT image using the three CT windows of lung window range [-1400, -200HU], high-attenuation range [-160, 240HU], and low-attenuation range [-1400; -950HU], then encoded the transformed images into RGB images.","To leverage the CNN architectures designed for color images and to transfer CNN parameters pre-trained on ImageNet, we transform all gray-scale axial CT slice images via three CT window ranges: lung window range [-1400, -200HU], high-attenuation range [-160, 240HU], and low-attenuation range [-1400; -950HU]. We then encode the transformed images into RGB channels (to be aligned with the input channels of CNN models [4], [33] pre-trained from natural image datasets [1]). The low-attenuation CT window is useful for visualizing certain texture patterns of lung diseases (especially emphysema). The usage of different CT attenuation channels improves classification results over the usage of a single CT windowing channel, as demonstrated in [40]. More importantly, these CT windowing processes do not depend on the lung segmentation, which instead is directly defined in the CT HU space. Figure 4 shows a representative example of lung, high-attenuation, and low-attenuation CT windowing for an axis lung CT slice."
How does CNN model learns to ignore areas that appear in both healthy and diseased lungs?,CNN training learns to ignore areas that appear in both healthy and diseased lungs by setting very small filter weights around the corresponding regions,The model learns very small weights in the filters for such areas.,"As observed in [40], lung segmentation is crucial to holistic slice-level ILD classification. We empirically compare performance in two scenarios with a rough lung segmentation111This can be achieved by segmenting the lung using simple label-fusion methods [48]. In the first case, we overlay the target image slice with the average lung mask among the training folds. In the second, we perform simple morphology operations to obtain the lung boundary. In order to retain information from the inside of the lung, we apply Gaussian smoothing to the regions outside of the lung boundary. There is no significant difference between two setups. Due to the high precision of CNN based image processing, highly accurate lung segmentation is not necessary . The localization of ILD regions within the lung is simultaneously learned through selectively weighted CNN reception fields in the deepest convolutional layers during the classification based CNN training [49, 50].Some areas outside of the lung appear in both healthy or diseased images. CNN training learns to ignore them by setting very small filter weights around the corresponding regions (Figure 13). This observation is validated by [40]."
What was the goal behind reducing the filter size and stride of the ALexNet and GoogLeNet ?,To accommodate smaller input sizes and improve performance on CADe problems,The authors reduced the filter size and stride of the two models because the input size used was smaller than what the original models were trained on.,"We use CifarNet [5] as used in [22] as a baseline for the LN detection.AlexNet [4] and GoogLeNet [33] are also modified to evaluate these state-of-the-art CNN architecture from ImageNet classification task [2] to our CADe problems and datasets.A simplified illustration of three CNN architectures exploited is shown in Figure 5.CifarNet always takes 32\times 32\times 3 image patches as input while AlexNet and GoogLeNet are originally designed for the fixed image dimension of 256\times 256\times 3 pixels.We also reduced the filter size, stride and pooling parameters of AlexNet and GoogLeNet to accommodate a smaller input size of 64\times 64\times 3 pixels.We do so to produce and evaluate “simplified” AlexNet and GoogLeNet versions that are better suited to the smaller scale training datasets common in CADe problems.Throughout the paper, we refer to the models as CifarNet (32x32) or CifarNet (dropping 32x32); AlexNet (256x256) or AlexNet-H (high resolution); AlexNet (64x64) or AlexNet-L (low resolution); GoogLeNet (256x256) or GoogLeNet-H and GoogLeNet (64x64) or GoogLeNet-L (dropping 3 since all image inputs are three channels)."
What is CifarNet?,A state-of-the-art model for object recognition on the Cifar10 dataset,CifarNet was a CNN model that was used for the object recognition task using the Cifar10 dataset.,"CifarNet, introduced in [5], was the state-of-the-art model for object recognition on the Cifar10 dataset, which consists of 32\times 32 images of 10 object classes.The objects are normally centered in the images.Some example images and class categories from the Cifar10 dataset are shown in Figure 7.CifarNet has three convolution layers, three pooling layers, and one fully-connected layer.This CNN architecture, also used in [22] has about 0.15 million free parameters.We adopt it as a baseline model for the LN detection."
How was the CNN parameters initialized?,Random Gaussian distributions,Parameters were initialized by sampling from random Gaussian distributions.,"When learned from scratch, all the parameters of CNN models are initialized with random Gaussian distributions and trained for 30 epochs with the mini-batch size of 50 image instances.Training convergence can be observed within 30 epochs. The other hyperparameters are momentum: 0.9; weight decay: 0.0005; (base) learning rate: 0.01, decreased by a factor of 10 at every 10 epochs. We use the Caffe framework [56] and NVidia K40 GPUs to train the CNNs."
What are the models that yielded the least competitive detection accuracy results on the Thoracoabdominal Lymph Node Detection?,"CifarNet, AlexNet-ImNet, and GoogLeNet-RI-H","CifarNet, AlexNet-ImNet and GoogLeNet-RI-H were the models that had the worst results.","Results for lymph node detection in the mediastinum and abdomen are reported in Table II.FROC curves are illustrated in Figure 8.The area-under-the-FROC-curve (AUC) and true positive rate (TPR, recall or sensitivity) at three false positives per patient (TPR/3FP) are used as performance metrics.Of the nine investigated CNN models, CifarNet, AlexNet-ImNet and GoogLeNet-RI-H generally yielded the least competitive detection accuracy results.Our LN datasets are significantly more complex (i.e., display much larger within-class appearance variations), especially due to the extracted fields-of-view (FOVs) of (35mm-128mm) compared to (30mm-45mm) in [22], where CifarNet is also employed.In this experiment, CifarNet is under-trained with respect to our enhanced LN datasets, due to its limited input resolution and parameter complexity.The inferior performance of AlexNet-ImNet implies that using the pre-trained ImageNet CNNs alone as “off-the-shelf” deep image feature extractors may not be optimal or adequate for mediastinal and abdominal LN detection tasks.To complement “off-the-shelf” CNN features, [10, 9, 12] all add and integrate various other hand-crafted image features as hybrid inputs for the final CADe classification."
Why did the GoogLENet-RI-H performs poorly in the Thoracoabdominal Lymph Node Detection task?,"GoogLeNet-RI-H performs poorly due to over-fitting, as there are not enough data samples available to properly train the model with random initialization","The model suffers from over-fitting, as it is a very complex model but it does not have enough training data for training.","GoogLeNet-RI-H performs poorly, as it is susceptible to over-fitting. No sufficient data samples are available to train GoogLeNet-RI-H with random initialization.Indeed, due to GoogLeNet-RI-H’s complexity and 22-layer depth, million-image datasets may be required to properly train this model.However, GoogLeNet-TL-H significantly improves upon GoogLeNet-RI-H (0.81 versus 0.61 TPR/3FP in mediastinum; 0.70 versus 0.48 TPR/3FP in abdomen). This indicates that transfer learning offers a much better initialization of CNN parameters than random initialization. Likewise, AlexNet-TL-H consistently outperforms AlexNet-RI-H, though by smaller margins (0.81 versus 0.79 TPR/3FP in mediastinum; 0.69 versus 0.67 TPR/3FP in abdomen). This is also consistent with the findings reported for ILD detection in Table III and Figure 11."
What is the best performing CNN model in the abdominal LN detection?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

GoogLeNet-TL (256x256) which obtains an AUC=0.92 and 0.70 TPR/3FP",The best performing model is GoogLeNet-TL.,"Many of our CNN models achieve notably better (FROC-AUC and TPR/3FP) results than the previous state-of-the-art models [36] for mediastinal LN detection: GoogLeNet-RI-L obtains an AUC=0.95 and 0.85 TPR/3FP, versus AUC=0.92 and 0.70 TPR/3FP [22] and 0.78 TPR/3FP [36] which uses stacked shallow learning.This difference lies in the fact that annotated lymph node segmentation masks are required to learn a mid-level semantic boundary detector [36], whereas CNN approaches only need LN locations for training [22]. In abdominal LN detection, [22] obtains the best trade-off between its CNN model complexity and sampled data configuration. Our best performing CNN model is GoogLeNet-TL (256x256) which obtains an AUC=0.92 and 0.70 TPR/3FP."
What is the difference between five-fold cross validation and leave-one-patient out?,"Five-fold cross-validation (CV) and leave-one-patient-out (LOO) are both methods for evaluating the performance of a model on unseen data, but they differ in how they partition the data for training and testing. In CV, the data is partitioned into five folds, and the model is trained and tested on each fold in turn, with the remaining four folds used for validation. In LOO, the data is partitioned such that each sample is used as a test set once, and the remaining samples are used for validation. LOO is generally considered a more stringent evaluation method, as it does not use any data from the test set for validation",LOO performs better than five-fold cross validation.,"To investigate the performance difference between five-fold cross-validation (CV) in Sec. IV-B and leave-one-patient-out (LOO) validation, this experiment is performed under the LOO protocol. By comparing results in Table III (CV-5) to those in Table VI (LOO), one can see that LOO’s quantitative performances are remarkably better than CV-5’s. For example, in ILD slice-level classification, the accuracy level drastically increases from 0.46 to 0.867 using AlexNet-TL, and from 0.57 to 0.902 for GoogLeNet-TL."
How is the original ILD images were reconstructed ?,"By de-convolution, back-propagating with convolution, and un-pooling from the activation maps of the chosen pooling units","A process consisting of deconvolution, back-propagation with convolution, and un-pooling from the activation maps of the pooling units was used to reconstruct the original ILD images.","The last pooling layer (pool-5) activation maps of the ImageNet pre-trained AlexNet [4] (analogical to AlexNet-ImNet) and AlexNet-TL, obtained by processing two input images of Figure 2 (b,c), are shown in Figure 13 (a,b). The last pooling layer activation map summarizes the entire input image by highlighting which relative locations or neural reception fields relative to the image are activated. There are a total of 256 (6x6) reception fields in AlexNet [4]. Pooling units where the relative image location of the disease region is present in the image are highlighted with green boxes. Next, we reconstruct the original ILD images using the process of de-convolution, back-propagating with convolution and un-pooling from the activation maps of the chosen pooling units [72]. From the reconstructed images (Figure 13 bottom), we observe that with fine-tuning, AlexNet-TL detects and localizes objects of interest (ILD disease regions depicted in in Figure 2 (b) and (c)) better than AlexNet-ImNet. The filters shown in Figure 13 that better localize regions on the input images (Figure 2 (b) and (c)) respectively, produce relatively higher activations (in the top 5%) among all 512 reception field responses in the fine-tuned AlexNet-TL model. As observed in [73], the final CNN classification score can not be driven solely by a single strong activation in the receptions fields, but often by a sparse set of high activations (i.e., varying selective or sparse activations per input image)."
Was Transfer learning beneficial on the CADe process? ,"YES. Transfer learning was consistently beneficial on the CADe process, as evidenced by the improved performance of the CNN models when trained on the large-scale annotated natural image datasets (ImageNet) and fine-tuned on the target medical image dataset","Transfer learning was shown to be beneficial in the paper's experiments, as seen by the differences in performance between AlexNet-TL/GoogLeNet-TL and their non-transfer learning counterparts.","While it is a more practical CADe scheme, slice-level CNN learning [40] is very challenging, as it is restricted to only 905 CT image slices with tagged ILD labels. We only benchmark the slice-level ILD classification results in this section. Even with the help of data augmentation (described in Sec. II), the classification accuracy of GoogLeNet-TL from Table III is only 0.57. However, transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained model is consistently beneficial, as evidenced by AlexNet-TL (0.46) versus AlexNet-RI (0.44), and GoogLeNet-TL (0.57) versus GoogLeNet-RI (0.41). It especially prevents GoogLeNet from over-fitting on the limited CADe datasets. Finally, when the cross-validation is conducted by randomly splitting the set of all 905 CT axial slices into five folds, markedly higher F-scores are obtained (Slice-Random in Table IV). This further validates the claim that the dataset poorly generalizes ILDs for different patients. Figure 10 shows examples of misclassified ILD patches (in axial view), with their ground truth labels and inaccurately classified labels. •Deep CNN architectures with 8, even 22 layers [4, 33], can be useful even for CADe problems where the available training datasets are limited. Previously, CNN models used in medical image analysis applications have often been 2\sim 5 orders of magnitude smaller.•The trade-off between using better learning models and using more training data [51] should be carefully considered when searching for an optimal solution to any CADe problem (e.g., mediastinal and abdominal LN detection).•Limited datasets can be a bottleneck to further advancement of CADe.

How the CADe problem can be improved? ,"By using deeper and better-annotated datasets, transfer learning from large-scale natural image datasets, and exploring the performance-complementary properties of hand-crafted features or fine-tuning CNNs on the target medical image dataset",They can be improved by either training CNNs from scratch and fine-tuning them or using hand-crafted features.,"•Deep CNN architectures with 8, even 22 layers [4, 33], can be useful even for CADe problems where the available training datasets are limited.

What is the used model inspired from?,VGG-net,It was inspired by VGG-net.,"We present a highly accurate single-image superresolution (SR) method. Our method uses a very deep convolutional network inspired by VGG-net used for ImageNet classification [19]. We find increasing our network depth shows a significant improvement in accuracy. Our final model uses 20 weight layers. By cascading small filters many times in a deep network structure, contextual information over large image regions is exploited in an efficient way. With very deep networks, however, convergence speed becomes a critical issue during training. We propose a simple yet effective training procedure. We learn residuals only and use extremely high learning rates (104 times higher than SRCNN [6]) enabled by adjustable gradient clipping. Our proposed method performs better than existing methods in accuracy and visual improvements in our results are easily noticeable."
Did increasing the network depth improved the results?,YES,"Yes, it did boost performance.","However, we argue that increasing depth significantly boosts performance. We successfully use 20 weight layers (3\times 3 for each layer). Our network is very deep (20 vs. 3 [6]) and information used for reconstruction (receptive field) is much larger (41\times 41 vs. 13\times 13). In this section, we study three properties of our proposed method. First, we show that large depth is necessary for the task of SR. A very deep network utilizes more contextual information in an image and models complex functions with many nonlinear layers. We experimentally verify that deeper networks give better performances than shallow ones. We now experimentally show that very deep networks significantly improve SR performance. We train and test networks of depth ranging from 5 to 20 (only counting weight layers excluding nonlinearity layers). In Figure 3, we show the results. In most cases, performance increases as depth increases. As depth increases, performance improves rapidly. In this work, we have presented a super-resolution method using very deep networks. Training a very deep network is hard due to a slow convergence rate. We use residual-learning and extremely high learning rates to optimize a very deep network fast. Convergence speed is maximized and we use gradient clipping to ensure the training stability. We have demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing method by a large margin on benchmarked images. We believe our approach is readily applicable to other image restoration problems such as denoising and compression artifact removal."
What is the issue that come with very deep networks?,Reduced feature map size and slow convergence rate,"Training is difficult for very deep networks as they have many parameters and it takes a long time for them to converge. Also, since convolutional layers shrink feature maps, having too deep a network could be bad.","One problem with using a very deep network to predict dense outputs is that the size of the feature map gets reduced every time convolution operations are applied. For example, when an input of size (n+1)\times(n+1) is applied to a network with receptive field size n\times n, the output image is 1\times 1. High Learning Rates for Very Deep NetworksTraining deep models can fail to converge in realistic limit of time. SRCNN [6] fails to show superior performance with more than three weight layers. While there can be various reasons, one possibility is that they stopped their training procedure before networks converged. Their learning rate 10^{-5} is too small for a network to converge within a week on a common GPU. Looking at Fig. 9 of [6], it is not easy to say their deeper networks have converged and their performances were saturated. While more training will eventually resolve the issue, but increasing depth to 20 does not seems practical with SRCNN. Multi-Scale While very deep models can boost performance, more parameters are now needed to define a network. Typically, one network is created for each scale factor. Considering that fractional scale factors are often used, we need an economical way to store and retrieve networks. In this work, we have presented a super-resolution method using very deep networks. Training a very deep network is hard due to a slow convergence rate. We use residual-learning and extremely high learning rates to optimize a very deep network fast. Convergence speed is maximized and we use gradient clipping to ensure the training stability. We have demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing method by a large margin on benchmarked images. We believe our approach is readily applicable to other image restoration problems such as denoising and compression artifact removal."
What is single image super-resolution?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a computer vision technique that aims to generate a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) input image, providing more image details and improving the overall resolution",Single image super-resolution is the task of generating a high-resolution image from a low-resolution one.,"We address the problem of generating a high-resolution (HR) image given a low-resolution (LR) image, commonly referred as single image super-resolution (SISR) [12], [8], [9]. SISR is widely used in computer vision applications ranging from security and surveillance imaging to medical imaging where more image details are required on demand."
What are the applications of SISR?,"SISR has numerous applications in computer vision, including security and surveillance imaging, medical imaging, and other applications where high-resolution images are required",SISR is used in computer vision applications such as surveillance imaging and medical image to enhance low-resolution images.,"We address the problem of generating a high-resolution (HR) image given a low-resolution (LR) image, commonly referred as single image super-resolution (SISR) [12], [8], [9]. SISR is widely used in computer vision applications ranging from security and surveillance imaging to medical imaging where more image details are required on demand."
Give examples of learning methods that are used in mapping from LR to HR?,"Sure! Here are some examples of learning methods used in mapping from LR to HR:

Neighbor embedding methods, Sparse coding methods, Random forest, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods","Neighbor embedding, sparse coding, random forests and CNN have been used to map from LR to HR.","Currently, learning methods are widely used to model a mapping from LR to HR patches. Neighbor embedding [4, 15] methods interpolate the patch subspace. Sparse coding [25, 26, 21, 22] methods use a learned compact dictionary based on sparse signal representation. Lately, random forest [18] and convolutional neural network (CNN) [6] have also been used with large improvements in accuracy. Among them, Dong et al. [6] has demonstrated that a CNN can be used to learn a mapping from LR to HR in an end-to-end manner. Their method, termed SRCNN, does not require any engineered features that are typically necessary in other methods [25, 26, 21, 22] and shows the state-of-the-art performance."
What are the limitations of the SRCNN in the SISR task?,"The limitations of SRCNN in the SISR task are:

1. Relying on the context of small image regions.
2. Training converges too slowly.
3. Only working for a single scale","It requires context from small image regions, it converges too slowly during training, and the network only works for one set scale.","Scale As in most existing SR methods, SRCNN is trained for a single scale factor and is supposed to work only with the specified scale. Thus, if a new scale is on demand, a new model has to be trained. To cope with multiple scale SR (possibly including fractional factors), we need to construct individual single scale SR system for each scale of interest. While SRCNN successfully introduced a deep learning technique into the super-resolution (SR) problem, we find its limitations in three aspects: first, it relies on the context of small image regions; second, training converges too slowly; third, the network only works for a single scale. We provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Compared methods are A+ [22], RFL[18], SelfEx [11] and SRCNN [5]. In Table 3, we provide a summary of quantitative evaluation on several datasets. Our methods outperform all previous methods in these datasets. Moreover, our methods are relatively fast. The public code of SRCNN based on a CPU implementation is slower than the code used by Dong et. al [6] in their paper based on a GPU implementation."
How did the authors speed up the training?,"The authors sped up the training by using an adjustable gradient clipping, residual-learning CNN, and extremely high learning rates","The authors used residual learning, extremely high learning rates, and adjustable gradient clipping.","It is a basic rule of thumb to make learning rate high to boost training. But simply setting learning rate high can also lead to vanishing/exploding gradients [2]. For the reason, we suggest an adjustable gradient clipping for maximal boost in speed while suppressing exploding gradients. For maximal speed of convergence, we clip the gradients to [-\frac{\theta}{\gamma},\frac{\theta}{\gamma}], where \gamma denotes the current learning rate. We find the adjustable gradient clipping makes our convergence procedure extremely fast. Our 20-layer network training is done within 4 hours whereas 3-layer SRCNN takes several days to train. Convergence We suggest a way to speed-up the training: residual-learning CNN and extremely high learning rates. As LR image and HR image share the same information to a large extent, explicitly modelling the residual image, which is the difference between HR and LR images, is advantageous. We propose a network structure for efficient learning when input and output are highly correlated. Moreover, our initial learning rate is 10^{4} times higher than that of SRCNN [6]. This is enabled by residual-learning and gradient clipping."
What is the goal behind using a single model SR approach?,"To efficiently handle multiple scale SR problems with a single network, reducing the need for multiple individual models and preparing for all possible scenarios","Existing methods are only trained for a single scale, so adapting them to other scales requires retraining. However, this would be impractical, so having a single model that accepts multiple scales would fix the problem.","Scale As in most existing SR methods, SRCNN is trained for a single scale factor and is supposed to work only with the specified scale. Thus, if a new scale is on demand, a new model has to be trained. To cope with multiple scale SR (possibly including fractional factors), we need to construct individual single scale SR system for each scale of interest. However, preparing many individual machines for all possible scenarios to cope with multiple scales is inefficient and impractical.In this work, we design and train a single network to handle multiple scale SR problem efficiently. This turns out to work very well. Our single machine is compared favorably to a single-scale expert for the given sub-task. For three scales factors (×2,3,4\times 2,3,4× 2 , 3 , 4), we can reduce the number of parameters by three-fold. Scale Factor We propose a single-model SR approach. Scales are typically user-specified and can be arbitrary including fractions. For example, one might need smooth zoom-in in an image viewer or resizing to a specific dimension. Training and storing many scale-dependent models in preparation for all possible scenarios is impractical. We find a single convolutional network is sufficient for multi-scale-factor super-resolution. Contribution In summary, in this work, we propose a highly accurate SR method based on a very deep convolutional network. Very deep networks converge too slowly if small learning rates are used. Boosting convergence rate with high learning rates lead to exploding gradients and we resolve the issue with residual-learning and gradient clipping. In addition, we extend our work to cope with multi-scale SR problem in a single network. Our method is relatively accurate and fast in comparison to state-of-the-art methods as illustrated in Figure 1."
What is the goal behind constructing individual single scale SR system?,"To cope with multiple scale SR, including fractional factors, by training individual single scale SR systems for each scale of interest","Since SRCNN is only trained for a single scale, we need to train individual single scale SRCNNs to deal with multiple scales.","Scale As in most existing SR methods, SRCNN is trained for a single scale factor and is supposed to work only with the specified scale. Thus, if a new scale is on demand, a new model has to be trained. To cope with multiple scale SR (possibly including fractional factors), we need to construct individual single scale SR system for each scale of interest."
What are the layers of the Model SRCNN?,"Patch extraction/representation, non-linear mapping, and reconstruction","SRCNN has three layers in the following order: patch extraction/representation, non-linear mapping, and reconstruction.","ModelSRCNN consists of three layers: patch extraction/representation, non-linear mapping and reconstruction. Filters of spatial sizes 9\times 9, 1\times 1, and 5\times 5 were used respectively."
What is the difference between the learning rate of the SRCNN and the learning rate of the proposed model?,The proposed model has a higher learning rate than SRCNN,"Not only does SRCNN uses different learning rates for its layers, while the proposed model uses the same learning rate for all of its layers, but the proposed model's initial learning rate is also 10000 times greater than SRCNN's.","In addition to the aforementioned issues, there are some minor differences. Our output image has the same size as the input image by padding zeros every layer during training whereas output from SRCNN is smaller than the input. Finally, we simply use the same learning rates for all layers while SRCNN uses different learning rates for different layers in order to achieve stable convergence. Convergence We suggest a way to speed-up the training: residual-learning CNN and extremely high learning rates. As LR image and HR image share the same information to a large extent, explicitly modelling the residual image, which is the difference between HR and LR images, is advantageous. We propose a network structure for efficient learning when input and output are highly correlated. Moreover, our initial learning rate is 10^{4} times higher than that of SRCNN [6]. This is enabled by residual-learning and gradient clipping."
What are the reasons of using residual learning ?,To address the vanishing/exploding gradients problem in deep neural networks and to improve the training speed and performance,"Residual learning solves the vanishing/exploding gradients problem, allowing for the model to converge faster and perform better.","Residual-Learning In SRCNN, the exact copy of the input has to go through all layers until it reaches the output layer. With many weight layers, this becomes an end-to-end relation requiring very long-term memory. For this reason, the vanishing/exploding gradients problem [2] can be critical. We can solve this problem simply with residual-learning. Second, we show that our residual-learning network converges much faster than the standard CNN. Moreover, our network gives a significant boost in performance. First, we find that this residual network converges much faster. Two networks are compared experimentally: the residual network and the standard non-residual network. We use depth 10 (weight layers) and scale factor 2. Performance curves for various learning rates are shown in Figure 4. All use the same learning rate scheduling mechanism that has been mentioned above. Second, at convergence, the residual network shows superior performance. In Figure 4, residual networks give higher PSNR when training is done. Another remark is that if small learning rates are used, networks do not converge in the given number of epochs. If initial learning rate 0.1 is used, PSNR of a residual-learning network reaches 36.90 within 10 epochs. But if 0.001 is used instead, the network never reaches the same level of performance (its performance is 36.52 after 80 epochs). In a similar manner, residual and non-residual networks show dramatic performance gaps after 10 epochs (36.90 vs. 27.42 for rate 0.1)."
How the loss was calculated in the proposed model ?,The loss was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the reconstructed image (the sum of network input and output) and ground truth,The loss is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the reconstructed image and the ground truth image.,"As the input and output images are largely similar, we define a residual image {\bf r}={\bf y}-{\bf x}, where most values are likely to be zero or small. We want to predict this residual image. The loss function now becomes \frac{1}{2}||\mathbf{r}-f(\mathbf{x})||^{2}, where f(\bf{x}) is the network prediction. In networks, this is reflected in the loss layer as follows.Our loss layer takes three inputs: residual estimate, network input (ILR image) and ground truth HR image. The loss is computed as the Euclidean distance between the reconstructed image (the sum of network input and output) and ground truth."
What was the momentum value used?,0.9,Momentum was set to 0.9.,"Training is carried out by optimizing the regression objective using mini-batch gradient descent based on back-propagation (LeCun et al. [14]). We set the momentum parameter to 0.9. The training is regularized by weight decay (L_{2} penalty multiplied by0.0001). We provide parameters used to train our final model. We use a network of depth 20. Training uses batches of size 64. Momentum and weight decay parameters are set to 0.9 and 0.0001, respectively."
What is gradient clipping?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Gradient clipping is a technique used in training recurrent neural networks to limit the magnitude of gradients during optimization, helping to prevent exploding gradients and improve training stability",Gradient clipping is a technique often used in training RNNs that alters hyperparameters such that the gradients are always within a certain range.,"Adjustable Gradient ClippingGradient clipping is a technique that is often used in training recurrent neural networks [17]. But, to our knowledge, its usage is limited in training CNNs. While there exist many ways to limit gradients, one of the common strategies is to clip individual gradients to the predefined range[-\theta,\theta]. With clipping, gradients are in a certain range. With stochastic gradient descent commonly used for training, learning rate is multiplied to adjust the step size. If high learning rate is used, it is likely that \theta is tuned to be small to avoid exploding gradients in a high learning rate regime. But as learning rate is annealed to get smaller, the effective gradient (gradient multiplied by learning rate) approaches zero and training can take exponentially many iterations to converge if learning rate is decreased geometrically."
Compare the training time of the proposed network to the SRCNN ?,"Our 20-layer network trains significantly faster than SRCNN, taking only 4 hours compared to several days for SRCNN",The proposed method is much faster than SRCNN by a scale of 10 or more.,"For maximal speed of convergence, we clip the gradients to [-\frac{\theta}{\gamma},\frac{\theta}{\gamma}], where \gamma denotes the current learning rate. We find the adjustable gradient clipping makes our convergence procedure extremely fast. Our 20-layer network training is done within 4 hours whereas 3-layer SRCNN takes several days to train. We provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Compared methods are A+ [22], RFL[18], SelfEx [11] and SRCNN [5]. In Table 3, we provide a summary of quantitative evaluation on several datasets. Our methods outperform all previous methods in these datasets. Moreover, our methods are relatively fast. The public code of SRCNN based on a CPU implementation is slower than the code used by Dong et. al [6] in their paper based on a GPU implementation."
What was the goal behind train a multi-scale model ?,To reduce the number of parameters in the model,"Single-scale models can only be used for one scale, so a new model must be trained for new scales. However, this would take too long, so a multi-scale model that uses the same parameters no matter the scale would reduce model capacity and make training more efficient.","Scale As in most existing SR methods, SRCNN is trained for a single scale factor and is supposed to work only with the specified scale. Thus, if a new scale is on demand, a new model has to be trained. To cope with multiple scale SR (possibly including fractional factors), we need to construct individual single scale SR system for each scale of interest. However, preparing many individual machines for all possible scenarios to cope with multiple scales is inefficient and impractical.In this work, we design and train a single network to handle multiple scale SR problem efficiently. This turns out to work very well. Our single machine is compared favorably to a single-scale expert for the given sub-task. For three scales factors (×2,3,4\times 2,3,4× 2 , 3 , 4), we can reduce the number of parameters by three-fold. For this reason, we also train a multi-scale model. With this approach, parameters are shared across all predefined scale factors. Training a multi-scale model is straightforward. Training datasets for several specified scales are combined into one big dataset. Third, we show that our method with a single network performs as well as a method using multiple networks trained for each scale. We can effectively reduce model capacity (the number of parameters) of multi-network approaches. Scale Factor We propose a single-model SR approach. Scales are typically user-specified and can be arbitrary including fractions. For example, one might need smooth zoom-in in an image viewer or resizing to a specific dimension. Training and storing many scale-dependent models in preparation for all possible scenarios is impractical. We find a single convolutional network is sufficient for multi-scale-factor super-resolution."
Difference between data preparation for the proposed model and the SRCNN?,"The proposed model's data preparation is similar to SRCNN, but with a fixed input patch size equal to the receptive field size and no overlap between sub-images","The proposed model's input size is the same as the receptive field size, and images were divided with no overlap.","Data preparation is similar to SRCNN [5] with some differences. Input patch size is now equal to the size of the receptive field and images are divided into sub-images with no overlap. A mini-batch consists of 64 sub-images, where sub-images from different scales can be in the same batch."
What are the main three properties of the model studied in this paper?,"1. Large depth is necessary for the task of super-resolution.
2. Our method with a single network performs as well as a method using multiple networks trained for each scale, while reducing model capacity.
3. Our residual-learning network converges much faster than the standard CNN and gives a significant boost in performance","They study the deepness of their model, the multi-scale property and how well it performs, and residual learning for faster convergence.","In this section, we study three properties of our proposed method. First, we show that large depth is necessary for the task of SR. A very deep network utilizes more contextual information in an image and models complex functions with many nonlinear layers. We experimentally verify that deeper networks give better performances than shallow ones. Third, we show that our method with a single network performs as well as a method using multiple networks trained for each scale. We can effectively reduce model capacity (the number of parameters) of multi-network approaches. Second, we show that our residual-learning network converges much faster than the standard CNN. Moreover, our network gives a significant boost in performance."
How did the authors imporved the accuarcy by making the model deeper but decreased the training time simultaneously?,"By using residual learning and extremely high learning rates, the authors were able to optimize a very deep network fast, improving accuracy while decreasing training time",They changed the model architecture to multi-scale to reduce model capacity and used residual learning with high learning rates to increase training speed.,"Second, we show that our residual-learning network converges much faster than the standard CNN. Moreover, our network gives a significant boost in performance. Third, we show that our method with a single network performs as well as a method using multiple networks trained for each scale. We can effectively reduce model capacity (the number of parameters) of multi-network approaches. In this work, we have presented a super-resolution method using very deep networks. Training a very deep network is hard due to a slow convergence rate. We use residual-learning and extremely high learning rates to optimize a very deep network fast. Convergence speed is maximized and we use gradient clipping to ensure the training stability. We have demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing method by a large margin on benchmarked images. We believe our approach is readily applicable to other image restoration problems such as denoising and compression artifact removal."
What is the key difference between inductive and transductive learning?,"Inductive learning involves training a model on a new task using a pre-trained model, while transductive learning involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a new task. In other words, inductive learning involves learning a new task from scratch, while transductive learning involves adapting a pre-trained model to a new task","General inductive transfer learning is, given a static source task and any target task where the source task and target task are not equal, to improve the performance of the target task. This occurs by fine-tuning a model that has been pretrained on other datasets. What transductive transfer learning is and the difference between transductive and inductive transfer learning cannot be answered from this paper.","Inductive transfer learning has had a large impact on computer vision (CV). Applied CV models (including object detection, classification, and segmentation) are rarely trained from scratch, but instead are fine-tuned from models that have been pretrained on ImageNet, MS-COCO, and other datasets Sharif Razavian et al. (2014); Long et al. (2015a); He et al. (2016); Huang et al. (2017). We are interested in the most general inductive transfer learning setting for NLP Pan and Yang (2010): Given a static source task \mathcal{T}_{S} and any target task \mathcal{T}_{T} with \mathcal{T}_{S}\neq\mathcal{T}_{T}, we would like to improve performance on \mathcal{T}_{T}. Language modeling can be seen as the ideal source task and a counterpart of ImageNet for NLP: It captures many facets of language relevant for downstream tasks, such as long-term dependencies Linzen et al. (2016), hierarchical relations Gulordava et al. (2018), and sentiment Radford et al. (2017). In contrast to tasks like MT McCann et al. (2017) and entailment Conneau et al. (2017), it provides data in near-unlimited quantities for most domains and languages. Additionally, a pretrained LM can be easily adapted to the idiosyncrasies of a target task, which we show significantly improves performance (see Section 5). Moreover, language modeling already is a key component of existing tasks such as MT and dialogue modeling. Formally, language modeling induces a hypothesis space \mathcal{H} that should be useful for many other NLP tasks Vapnik and Kotz (1982); Baxter (2000). While Deep Learning models have achieved state-of-the-art on many NLP tasks, these models are trained from scratch, requiring large datasets, and days to converge. Research in NLP focused mostly on transductive transfer Blitzer et al. (2007). For inductive transfer, fine-tuning pretrained word embeddings Mikolov et al. (2013), a simple transfer technique that only targets a model’s first layer, has had a large impact in practice and is used in most state-of-the-art models. Recent approaches that concatenate embeddings derived from other tasks with the input at different layers Peters et al. (2017); McCann et al. (2017); Peters et al. (2018) still train the main task model from scratch and treat pretrained embeddings as fixed parameters, limiting their usefulness."
What is catastrophic forgetting?,"Catastrophic forgetting refers to the phenomenon where a model, after being fine-tuned on a small dataset, forgets the knowledge it previously learned during pretraining, resulting in poor performance on both the original and fine-tuning tasks",Catastrophic forgetting involved increasing error as a model start to overfit and knowledge captured through pretraining is lost.,"Fine-tuning the target classifier is the most critical part of the transfer learning method. Overly aggressive fine-tuning will cause catastrophic forgetting, eliminating the benefit of the information captured through language modeling; too cautious fine-tuning will lead to slow convergence (and resultant overfitting). Besides discriminative fine-tuning and triangular learning rates, we propose gradual unfreezing for fine-tuning the classifier. We show that not the idea of LM fine-tuning but our lack of knowledge of how to train them effectively has been hindering wider adoption. LMs overfit to small datasets and suffered catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned with a classifier. Compared to CV, NLP models are typically more shallow and thus require different fine-tuning methods. On all datasets, fine-tuning the full model leads to the lowest error comparatively early in training, e.g. already after the first epoch on IMDb. The error then increases as the model starts to overfit and knowledge captured through pretraining is lost. In contrast, ULMFiT is more stable and suffers from no such catastrophic forgetting; performance remains similar or improves until late epochs, which shows the positive effect of the learning rate schedule."
"What does ""MT domains"" mean? ",Machine Translation (MT) domains,MT stands for Machine Translation.,"Hypercolumns In NLP, only recently have methods been proposed that go beyond transferring word embeddings. The prevailing approach is to pretrain embeddings that capture additional context via other tasks. Embeddings at different levels are then used as features, concatenated either with the word embeddings or with the inputs at intermediate layers. This method is known as hypercolumns (Hariharan et al., 2015) in CV2 and is used by Peters et al. (2017), Peters et al. (2018), Wieting and Gimpel (2017), Conneau et al. (2017), and McCann et al. (2017) who use language modeling, paraphrasing, entailment, and Machine Translation (MT) respectively for pretraining. Specifically, Peters et al. (2018) require engineered custom architectures, while we show state-of-the-art performance with the same basic architecture across a range of tasks. In CV, hypercolumns have been nearly entirely superseded by end-to-end fine-tuning (Long et al., 2015a)."
What metrics are used to compare the performance of ULMFiT against existing approaches?,Error rates,"For consistency, the authors reported all results as error rates where lower is better.","In order to assess the impact of each contribution, we perform a series of analyses and ablations. We run experiments on three corpora, IMDb, TREC-6, and AG that are representative of different tasks, genres, and sizes. For all experiments, we split off 10\% of the training set and report error rates on this validation set with unidirectional LMs. We fine-tune the classifier for 50 epochs and train all methods but ULMFiT with early stopping. Our contributions are the following: 1) We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), a method that can be used to achieve CV-like transfer learning for any task for NLP. 2) We propose discriminative fine-tuning, slanted triangular learning rates, and gradual unfreezing, novel techniques to retain previous knowledge and avoid catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. 3) We significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on six representative text classification datasets, with an error reduction of 18-24% on the majority of datasets. 4) We show that our method enables extremely sample-efficient transfer learning and perform an extensive ablation analysis. 5) We make the pretrained models and our code available to enable wider adoption. For consistency, we report all results as error rates (lower is better). We show the test error rates on the IMDb and TREC-6 datasets used by McCann et al. (2017) in Table 2. Our method outperforms both CoVe, a state-of-the-art transfer learning method based on hypercolumns, as well as the state-of-the-art on both datasets. On IMDb, we reduce the error dramatically by 43.9% and 22% with regard to CoVe and the state-of-the-art respectively. This is promising as the existing state-of-the-art requires complex architectures (Peters et al., 2018), multiple forms of attention (McCann et al., 2017) and sophisticated embedding schemes (Johnson and Zhang, 2016), while our method employs a regular LSTM with dropout. We note that the language model fine-tuning approach of Dai and Le (2015) only achieves an error of 7.64 vs. 4.6 for our method on IMDb, demonstrating the benefit of transferring knowledge from a large ImageNet-like corpus using our fine-tuning techniques. IMDb in particular is reflective of real world datasets: Its documents are generally a few paragraphs long—similar to emails (e.g for legal discovery) and online comments (e.g for community management); and sentiment analysis is similar to many commercial applications, e.g. product response tracking and support email routing."
Does the proposed approach in the paper require a labelled dataset?,No,"ULMFiT first pretrains a language model on a large general-domain corpus, and does not require any additional in-domain documents or labels for this. Then, the method will fine-tune the model on a target task using novel techniques. In fine-tuning, labelled examples and, if available, other task data are used.","One of the main benefits of transfer learning is being able to train a model for a task with a small number of labels. We evaluate ULMFiT on different numbers of labeled examples in two settings: only labeled examples are used for LM fine-tuning (‘supervised’); and all task data is available and can be used to fine-tune the LM (‘semi-supervised’). We compare ULMFiT to training from scratch—which is necessary for hypercolumn-based approaches. We split off balanced fractions of the training data, keep the validation set fixed, and use the same hyperparameters as before. We show the results in Figure 3. We propose Universal Language Model Finetuning (ULMFiT), which pretrains a language model (LM) on a large general-domain corpus and fine-tunes it on the target task using novel techniques. The method is universal in the sense that it meets these practical criteria: 1) It works across tasks varying in document size, number, and label type; 2) it uses a single architecture and training process; 3) it requires no custom feature engineering or preprocessing; and 4) it does not require additional in-domain documents or labels."
How well do the proposed model in this paper and the model in Dai and Lee (2015) generalize to documents of varying lengths?,The proposed model in this paper generalizes better to documents of varying lengths compared to the model in Dai and Lee (2015),"This work’s method was evaluated in six widely-studied datasets which varied in document length and experimental results demonstrated that the method outperformed existing approaches in all of these datasets. This indicates that this work’s method generalizes to documents of varying lengths. Also compared to Dai and Le, this method achieved a lower error rate on IMDb showing that it also generalizes better to document lengths reflective of the real world.","We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), which pretrains a language model (LM) on a large general-domain corpus and fine-tunes it on the target task using novel techniques.

We evaluate our method on six widely-studied datasets, with varying numbers of documents and varying document length, used by state-of-the-art text classification and transfer learning approaches Johnson and Zhang (2017); McCann et al.

We propose a new method, Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) that addresses these issues and enables robust inductive transfer learning for any NLP task, akin to fine-tuning ImageNet models: The same 3-layer LSTM architecture—with the same hyperparameters and no additions other than tuned dropout hyperparameters—outperforms highly engineered models and transfer learning approaches on six widely studied text classification tasks. On IMDb, with 100 labeled examples, ULMFiT matches the performance of training from scratch with 10×10\times10 × and—given 50k unlabeled examples—with 100×100\times100 × more data."
Are batch normalisation and dropout used for the same reasons?,"No.

Batch normalization and dropout are used for different reasons. Batch normalization is used to reduce the internal covariate shift and improve the stability of the training process, while dropout is used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model",This work follows standard practices for CV classifiers by using batch normalization and dropout in each block. Dropout is used to reduce the risk of overfitting which can decrease performance. The reason for using batch normalization cannot be answered in this paper.,"Finally, for fine-tuning the classifier, we augment the pretrained language model with two additional linear blocks.Following standard practice for CV classifiers, each block uses batch normalization Ioffe and Szegedy (2015) and dropout, with ReLU activations for the intermediate layer and a softmax activation that outputs a probability distribution over target classes at the last layer. Note that the parameters in these task-specific classifier layers are the only ones that are learned from scratch. The first linear layer takes as the input the pooled last hidden layer states. In order to gauge the importance of choosing an appropriate LM, we compare a vanilla LM with the same hyperparameters without any dropout999To avoid overfitting, we only train the vanilla LM classifier for 5 epochs and keep dropout of 0.4 in the classifier. with the AWD-LSTM LM with tuned dropout parameters in Table 5. Using our fine-tuning techniques, even a regular LM reaches surprisingly good performance on the larger datasets. On the smaller TREC-6, a vanilla LM without dropout runs the risk of overfitting, which decreases performance."
What is the average number of words in a Wikipedia article from the Wikitext-103 dataset? ,103 million words,"The Wikitext-103 dataset consists of 28,595 preprocessed Wikipedia articles and 103 million words. Therefore, the approximate average number of words per article in this dataset is 3,602.","An ImageNet-like corpus for language should be large and capture general properties of language. We pretrain the language model on Wikitext-103 Merity et al. (2017b) consisting of 28,595 preprocessed Wikipedia articles and 103 million words. Pretraining is most beneficial for tasks with small datasets and enables generalization even with 100 labeled examples. We leave the exploration of more diverse pretraining corpora to future work, but expect that they would boost performance. While this stage is the most expensive, it only needs to be performed once and improves performance and convergence of downstream models."
"Out of all the classification datasets used in the experiments of this paper, what is the ratio of number of samples in the largest to the smallest dataset?",10:1,The statistics for each dataset and task are found in Table  1. The ratio of the number of samples in the largest to smallest dataset could be calculated from these statistics.,"We evaluate our method on six widely-studied datasets, with varying numbers of documents and varying document length, used by state-of-the-art text classification and transfer learning approaches Johnson and Zhang (2017); McCann et al. (2017) as instances of three common text classification tasks: sentiment analysis, question classification, and topic classification. We show the statistics for each dataset and task in Table 1."
Why does the proposed model need advanced preprocessing and feature generation to function well?,The proposed model does not need advanced preprocessing and feature generation to function well,"The proposed model is universal meaning that it does not require custom feature engineering or preprocessing. For example, the pre-processing is taken from earlier work and only adds special tokens to capture relevant aspects for classification.","We use the same pre-processing as in earlier work Johnson and Zhang (2017); McCann et al. (2017). In addition, to allow the language model to capture aspects that might be relevant for classification, we add special tokens for upper-case words, elongation, and repetition. We propose Universal Language Model Finetuning (ULMFiT), which pretrains a language model (LM) on a large general-domain corpus and fine-tunes it on the target task using novel techniques. The method is universal in the sense that it meets these practical criteria: 1) It works across tasks varying in document size, number, and label type; 2) it uses a single architecture and training process; 3) it requires no custom feature engineering or preprocessing; and 4) it does not require additional in-domain documents or labels"
Do the authors perform hyperparameter tuning for each dataset independently?,"No, the authors do not perform hyperparameter tuning for each dataset independently. They use the same set of hyperparameters across all tasks, which are tuned on the IMDb validation set","The authors did not perform hyperparameter tuning for each dataset. They used the same set of hyperparameters across tasks, and they tuned the parameters on the IMDb validation set.","We are interested in a model that performs robustly across a diverse set of tasks. To this end, if not mentioned otherwise, we use the same set of hyperparameters across tasks, which we tune on the IMDb validation set. We use the AWD-LSTM language model (Merity et al., 2017a) with an embedding size of 400, 3 layers, 1150 hidden activations per layer, and a BPTT batch size of 70. We apply dropout of 0.4 to layers, 0.3 to RNN layers, 0.4 to input embedding layers, 0.05 to embedding layers, and weight dropout of 0.5 to the RNN hidden-to-hidden matrix. The classifier has a hidden layer of size 50. We use Adam with β1 = 0.7 instead of the default β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.99, similar to (Dozat and Manning, 2017). We use a batch size of 64, a base learning rate of 0.004 and 0.01 for finetuning the LM and the classifier respectively, and tune the number of epochs on the validation set of each task7 . We otherwise use the same practices"
By how much does the proposed approach outperform CoVE?,The proposed approach outperforms CoVE by 43.9% on IMDb and 22% on TREC-6,"On IMDb, the proposed approach reduced the error by 43.9% when compared to CoVe but, on TREC-6, the approach did not improve performance significantly. The results are shown in Table 2.","For consistency, we report all results as error rates (lower is better). We show the test error rates on the IMDb and TREC-6 datasets used by McCann et al. (2017) in Table 2. Our method outperforms both CoVe, a state-of-the-art transfer learning method based on hypercolumns, as well as the state-of-the-art on both datasets.

On TREC-6, our improvement—similar as the improvements of state-of-the-art approaches—is not statistically significant, due to the small size of the 500-examples test set.Nevertheless, the competitive performance on TREC-6 demonstrates that our model performs well across different dataset sizes and can deal with examples that range from single sentences—in the case of TREC-6—to several paragraphs for IMDb. Note that despite pretraining on more than two orders of magnitude less data than the 7 million sentence pairs used by McCann et al. (2017), we consistently outperform their approach on both datasets."
What does early stopping while training mean?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Early stopping refers to the practice of stopping the training process before the maximum number of epochs has been reached, based on the validation performance of the model","In this work, all the other methods but ULMFiT were trained with early stopping. The meaning of early stopping cannot be answered from this paper.","In order to assess the impact of each contribution, we perform a series of analyses and ablations. We run experiments on three corpora, IMDb, TREC6, and AG that are representative of different tasks, genres, and sizes.

Are there any differences between AWD-LSTM and LSTMs in general?,"Yes, there are differences between AWD-LSTM and LSTMs in general. AWD-LSTM has additional architectural components such as attention, short-cut connections, and dropout, which improve its performance compared to regular LSTMs","The language model AWD-LSTM is a regular LSTM with various tuned dropout hyperparameters, but with no attention, short-cut connections or other sophisticated additions. The particular difference between AWD-LSTM and LSTMs in general is not specified and cannot be answered from this paper.","In our experiments, we use the state-of-the-art language model AWD-LSTM Merity et al. (2017a), a regular LSTM (with no attention, short-cut connections, or other sophisticated additions) with various tuned dropout hyperparameters. Analogous to CV, we expect that downstream performance can be improved by using higher-performance language models in the future."
"If, for a certain model, it was theorized that the penultimate layer is the most important later for generating embeddings, how could discriminative fine-tuning be used to validate or refute that theory?","Discriminative fine-tuning could be used to validate or refute the theory by fine-tuning only the penultimate layer and measuring the model's performance on the target task. If the model's performance improves significantly, it would suggest that the penultimate layer is indeed important for generating embeddings","In this work, discriminative fine-tuning was used to fine-tune each layer with a different learning rate. Specifically, the learning rate was decreased going from the last layer to lower layers. The authors found that this improved performance across several datasets. This suggests that this result shows that the last layers are most important for classification as the technique assigned higher learning rates to them which also increased performance.","As different layers capture different types of information Yosinski et al. (2014), they should be fine-tuned to different extents.To this end, we propose a novel fine-tuning method, discriminative fine-tuning444An unrelated method of the same name exists for deep Boltzmann machines Salakhutdinov and Hinton (2009).. We compare no fine-tuning against fine-tuning the full model Erhan et al. (2010) (‘Full’), the most commonly used fine-tuning method, with and without discriminative fine-tuning (‘Discr’) and slanted triangular learning rates (‘Stlr’) in Table 6. Fine-tuning the LM is most beneficial for larger datasets. ‘Discr’ and ‘Stlr’ improve performance across all three datasets and are necessary on the smaller TREC-6, where regular fine-tuning is not beneficial. The SGD update with discriminative finetuning is then the following: θ l t = θ l t−1 − η l · ∇θ lJ(θ) (2) We empirically found it to work well to first choose the learning rate η L of the last layer by fine-tuning only the last layer and using η l−1 = η l/2.6 as the learning rate for lower layers."
"While the proposed approach uses Adam, would there be any systemic issues with using SGD or RMSProp with discriminative fine-tuning?","No, there would not be any systemic issues with using SGD or RMSProp with discriminative fine-tuning. The choice of optimizer is not critical to the success of discriminative fine-tuning, as long as the learning rate is properly adjusted for each layer",Discriminative fine-tuning tunes each layer with different learning rates. The systemic issues that will occur from using SGD or RMSProp with discriminative fine-tuning cannot be answered from this paper.,"Instead of using the same learning rate for all layers of the model, discriminative fine-tuning allows us to tune each layer with different learning rates. For context, the regular stochastic gradient descent (SGD) update of a model’s parameters \theta at time step t looks like the following Ruder (2016):\theta_{t}=\theta_{t-1}-\eta\cdot\nabla_{\theta}J(\theta)(1)where \eta is the learning rate and \nabla_{\theta}J(\theta) is the gradient with regard to the model’s objective function. For discriminative fine-tuning, we split the parameters \theta into \{\theta^{1},\ldots,\theta^{L}\} where \theta^{l} contains the parameters of the model at the l-th layer and L is the number of layers of the model. Similarly, we obtain \{\eta^{1},\ldots,\eta^{L}\} where \eta^{l} is the learning rate of the l-th layer. The SGD update with discriminative fine-tuning is then the following:\theta_{t}^{l}=\theta_{t-1}^{l}-\eta^{l}\cdot\nabla_{\theta^{l}}J(\theta)(2)We empirically found it to work well to first choose the learning rate \eta^{L} of the last layer by fine-tuning only the last layer and using \eta^{l-1}=\eta^{l}/2.6 as the learning rate for lower layers."
"The paper mentions how training two models, one forward model and one backward model (to achieve bidirectionality) results in a performance gain. Is the performance gain proportional to the 2x increase in training cost?","Sure! Here's my answer:

No. The performance gain is not proportional to the 2x increase in training cost","Training a second model to ensemble a bidirectional model brings a performance boost of around 0.5 to 0.7 and, on IMDb, it lowers test error from 5.30 to 4.58. The increase in performance (or decrease of test error) is of around 15% which is not proportional to the 2x increase in training cost.","At the cost of training a second model, ensembling the predictions of a forward and backwards LM-classifier brings a performance boost of around 0.5–0.7. On IMDb we lower the test error from 5.30 of a single model to 4.58 for the bidirectional model."
"What theoretical backing, if any, exists to support the authors' numerical arguments around how their techniques minimze catastrophic forgetting?","The theoretical backing for the authors' numerical arguments around minimizing catastrophic forgetting is the concept of ""rehearsal"" in the context of learning and memory. The learning rate schedule and the regularization techniques used in ULMFiT help to actively retain and rehearse previously learned knowledge, preventing it from being overwritten or forgotten. This is supported by research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience that shows that actively retrieving and rehearsing information helps to strengthen and stabilize memory","Fine-tuning the full model leads to low error early in training, but then error increases as the model overfits and loses knowledge captured through pretraining. The authors refer to this as catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, ULMFiT is more stable as performance remains similar or improves even until later epochs. Thus, the authors argue that ULMFiT’s stable performance until later epochs is evidence that catastrophic forgetting is minimized.","On all datasets, fine-tuning the full model leads to the lowest error comparatively early in training, e.g. already after the first epoch on IMDb. The error then increases as the model starts to overfit and knowledge captured through pretraining is lost. In contrast, ULMFiT is more stable and suffers from no such catastrophic forgetting; performance remains similar or improves until late epochs, which shows the positive effect of the learning rate schedule"
"How would using max-pooling, min-pooling, or mean-pooling instead of the proposed concat-pooling impact memory utilisation during training? ","Using max-pooling, min-pooling, or mean-pooling instead of concat-pooling would likely increase memory utilization during training","Concat-pooling functions by concatenating the hidden state of the last time step of the document with both the max-pooled and mean-pooled representations of the hidden states. This pooling is done for as many time steps as fit in GPU memory. This means that concat-pooling utilises as much memory as there is available. The memory utilisation of using max-pooling, min-pooling, or mean-pooling cannot be answered from this paper.","The signal in text classification tasks is often contained in a few words, which may occur anywhere in the document. As input documents can consist of hundreds of words, information may get lost if we only consider the last hidden state of the model. For this reason, we concatenate the hidden state at the last time step \mathbf{h}_{T} of the document with both the max-pooled and the mean-pooled representation of the hidden states over as many time steps as fit in GPU memory \mathbf{H}=\{\mathbf{h}_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{h}_{T}\}:\mathbf{h}_{c}=[\mathbf{h}_{T},\mathtt{maxpool}(\mathbf{H}),\mathtt{meanpool}(\mathbf{H})](4)where [] is concatenation."
What is back propogation through time?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Backpropagation through time (BPTT) is a method for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to handle sequential data by propagating gradients backwards in time","Backpropagation through time (BPTT) is used to train language models to enable gradient propagation for large input sequences. This work proposes BPTT for text classification (BPT3C) where a document is first divided into fixed-length batches. At the beginning of each batch, the model is initialized with the final state of the previous batch and gradients are back-propagated to the batches whose hidden states contributed to the final prediction. Whether the process in BPT3C is the same as the process in BPTT cannot be answered from this paper.","Language models are trained with backpropagation through time (BPTT) to enable gradient propagation for large input sequences. In order to make fine-tuning a classifier for large documents feasible, we propose BPTT for Text Classification (BPT3C): We divide the document into fixed-length batches of size b. At the beginning of each batch, the model is initialized with the final state of the previous batch; we keep track of the hidden states for mean and max-pooling; gradients are back-propagated to the batches whose hidden states contributed to the final prediction. In practice, we use variable length backpropagation sequences Merity et al. (2017a)."
"Why do the authors claim that their proposed model is ""sample efficient""? ","The authors claim that their proposed model is ""sample efficient"" because it achieves high performance with a small number of labeled examples, outperforming highly engineered models and transfer learning approaches on six text classification tasks","The authors claim that their proposed method enables sample-efficient transfer learning through experiments where they showed that, with only 100 labelled examples, ULMFiT could match the performance of training from scratch with 10 to 20 times more data.","We propose a new method, Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) that addresses these issues and enables robust inductive transfer learning for any NLP task, akin to fine-tuning ImageNet models: The same 3-layer LSTM architecture—with the same hyperparameters and no additions other than tuned dropout hyperparameters—outperforms highly engineered models and transfer learning approaches on six widely studied text classification tasks. On IMDb, with 100 labeled examples, ULMFiT matches the performance of training from scratch with 10×10\times10 × and—given 50k unlabeled examples—with 100×100\times100 × more data. Our contributions are the following: 1) We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), a method that can be used to achieve CV-like transfer learning for any task for NLP. 2) We propose discriminative fine-tuning, slanted triangular learning rates, and gradual unfreezing, novel techniques to retain previous knowledge and avoid catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. 3) We significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on six representative text classification datasets, with an error reduction of 18-24% on the majority of datasets. 4) We show that our method enables extremely sample-efficient transfer learning and perform an extensive ablation analysis. 5) We make the pretrained models and our code available to enable wider adoption. On IMDb and AG, supervised ULMFiT with only 100 labeled examples matches the performance of training from scratch with 10× and 20× more data respectively, clearly demonstrating the benefit of general-domain LM pretraining. If we allow ULMFiT to also utilize unlabeled examples (50k for IMDb, 100k for AG), at 100 labeled examples, we match the performance of training from scratch with 50× and 100× more data on AG and IMDb respectively. On TREC-6, ULMFiT significantly improves upon training from scratch; as examples are shorter and fewer, supervised and semi-supervised ULMFiT achieve similar results."
Is weak supervision a subset or type of regular supervised learning?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

No.

Weak supervision is not a subset or type of regular supervised learning, as it involves using a small number of labeled examples to fine-tune a pre-trained language model, whereas regular supervised learning typically requires a larger amount of labeled data to train a model from scratch","In this work, fine-tuning an LM only on labeled examples is considered to be supervised learning. The general definitions of supervised learning and weak supervision, and whether weak supervision is a subset of regular supervised learning cannot be answered in this paper.","One of the main benefits of transfer learning is being able to train a model for a task with a small number of labels. We evaluate ULMFiT on different numbers of labeled examples in two settings: only labeled examples are used for LM fine-tuning (‘supervised’); and all task data is available and can be used to fine-tune the LM (‘semi-supervised’). We compare ULMFiT to training from scratch—which is necessary for hypercolumn-based approaches. We split off balanced fractions of the training data, keep the validation set fixed, and use the same hyperparameters as before. We show the results in Figure 3."
