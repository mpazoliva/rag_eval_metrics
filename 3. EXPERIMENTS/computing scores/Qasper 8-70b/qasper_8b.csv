0,What is the seed lexicon?,A vocabulary of positive and negative predicates that helps determine the polarity score of an event.,"The seed lexicon consists of positive and negative predicates. If the predicate of an extracted event is in the seed lexicon and does not involve complex phenomena like negation, we assign the corresponding polarity score ($+1$ for positive events and $-1$ for negative events) to the event. We expect the model to automatically learn complex phenomena through label propagation. Based on the availability of scores and the types of discourse relations, we classify the extracted event pairs into the following three types.",A lexicon of positive and negative predicates.,0.5454545411157026,0.3809523768707483,0.5454545411157026,23.287896954139946,64.04101408441568,62.64611950881919,0.3942197997211307,0.006323396567299,0.7312201261520386,0.7808500230312347,0.7312200665473938,0.7952051162719727

2,How are relations used to propagate polarity?,"Based on the relation between events, the suggested polarity of one event can determine the possible polarity of the other event.","In this paper, we propose a simple and effective method for learning affective events that only requires a very small seed lexicon and a large raw corpus. As illustrated in Figure FIGREF1, our key idea is that we can exploit discourse relations BIBREF4 to efficiently propagate polarity from seed predicates that directly report one's emotions (e.g., “to be glad” is positive). Suppose that events $x_1$ are $x_2$ are in the discourse relation of Cause (i.e., $x_1$ causes $x_2$). If the seed lexicon suggests $x_2$ is positive, $x_1$ is also likely to be positive because it triggers the positive emotion. The fact that $x_2$ is known to be negative indicates the negative polarity of $x_1$. Similarly, if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in the discourse relation of Concession (i.e., $x_2$ in spite of $x_1$), the reverse of $x_2$'s polarity can be propagated to $x_1$. Even if $x_2$'s polarity is not known in advance, we can exploit the tendency of $x_1$ and $x_2$ to be of the same polarity (for Cause) or of the reverse polarity (for Concession) although the heuristic is not exempt from counterexamples.

4,How big is the Japanese data?,"7000000 pairs of events were extracted from the Japanese Web corpus, 529850 pairs of events were extracted from the ACP corpus.","As a raw corpus, we used a Japanese web corpus that was compiled through the procedures proposed by BIBREF13. To extract event pairs tagged with discourse relations, we used the Japanese dependency parser KNP and in-house postprocessing scripts BIBREF14. KNP used hand-written rules to segment each sentence into what we conventionally called clauses (mostly consecutive text chunks), each of which contained one main predicate. KNP also identified the discourse relations of event pairs if explicit discourse connectives BIBREF4 such as “ので” (because) and “のに” (in spite of) were present. We treated Cause/Reason (原因・理由) and Condition (条件) in the original tagset BIBREF15 as Cause and Concession (逆接) as Concession, respectively. Here is an example of event pair extraction.
We constructed our seed lexicon consisting of 15 positive words and 15 negative words, as shown in Section SECREF27. From the corpus of about 100 million sentences, we obtained 1.4 millions event pairs for AL, 41 millions for CA, and 6 millions for CO. We randomly selected subsets of AL event pairs such that positive and negative latter events were equal in size. We also sampled event pairs for each of CA and CO such that it was five times larger than AL. The results are shown in Table TABREF16.

We used the latest version of the ACP Corpus BIBREF12 for evaluation. It was used for (semi-)supervised training as well. Extracted from Japanese websites using HTML layouts and linguistic patterns, the dataset covered various genres. For example, the following two sentences were labeled positive and negative, respectively:
Although the ACP corpus was originally constructed in the context of sentiment analysis, we found that it could roughly be regarded as a collection of affective events. We parsed each sentence and extracted the last clause in it. The train/dev/test split of the data is shown in Table TABREF19.

6,How do the various social phenomena examined manifest in different types of communities?,Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.,"We find that dynamic communities, such as Seahawks or starcraft, have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities (Spearman's INLINEFORM0 = 0.70, INLINEFORM1 0.001, computed with community points averaged over months; Figure FIGREF11 .A, left). Similarly, more distinctive communities, like Cooking and Naruto, exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities (Spearman's INLINEFORM2 = 0.33, INLINEFORM3 0.001; Figure FIGREF11 .A, right).
As with monthly retention, we find a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community (Spearman's INLINEFORM0 = 0.41, INLINEFORM1 0.001, computed over all community points; Figure FIGREF11 .B, left). This verifies that the short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content. Interestingly, there is no significant relationship between distinctiveness and long-term engagement (Spearman's INLINEFORM2 = 0.03, INLINEFORM3 0.77; Figure FIGREF11 .B, right). Thus, while highly distinctive communities like RandomActsOfMakeup may generate focused commitment from users over a short period of time, such communities are unlikely to retain long-term users unless they also have sufficiently dynamic content.","Dynamic communities exhibit higher user retention rates, both short-term and long-term, while distinctive communities show higher short-term retention but not long-term.",0.256410253001315,0.0792079176159201,0.2307692273602893,2.023079706348914,45.617078402144486,41.05898981676384,0.1079057239057239,0.002792181890706,0.8915085792541504,0.9732802831209624,0.8849221467971802,0.7377541661262512

9,How is the clinical text structuring task defined?,CTS is extracting structural data from medical research data (unstructured). Authors define QA-CTS task that aims to discover most related text from original text.,"Clinical text structuring (CTS) is a critical task for fetching medical research data from electronic health records (EHRs), where structural patient medical data, such as whether the patient has specific symptoms, diseases, or what the tumor size is, how far from the tumor is cut at during the surgery, or what the specific laboratory test result is, are obtained. It is important to extract structured data from clinical text because bio-medical systems or bio-medical researches greatly rely on structured data but they cannot obtain them directly. In addition, clinical text often contains abundant healthcare information. CTS is able to provide large-scale extracted structured data for enormous down-stream clinical researches.
However, end-to-end CTS is a very challenging task. Different CTS tasks often have non-uniform output formats, such as specific-class classifications (e.g. tumor stage), strings in the original text (e.g. result for a laboratory test) and inferred values from part of the original text (e.g. calculated tumor size). Researchers have to construct different models for it, which is already costly, and hence it calls for a lot of labeled data for each model. Moreover, labeling necessary amount of data for training neural network requires expensive labor cost. To handle it, researchers turn to some rule-based structuring methods which often have lower labor cost.
To reduce the pipeline depth and break the barrier of non-uniform output formats, we present a question answering based clinical text structuring (QA-CTS) task (see Fig. FIGREF1). Unlike the traditional CTS task, our QA-CTS task aims to discover the most related text from original paragraph text. For some cases, it is already the final answer in deed (e.g., extracting sub-string). While for other cases, it needs several steps to obtain the final answer, such as entity names conversion and negative words recognition. Our presented QA-CTS task unifies the output format of the traditional CTS task and make the training data shareable, thus enriching the training data. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows.",It is defined as discovering the most related text from original paragraph text.,0.3636363590082644,0.2285714240653061,0.3636363590082644,14.865996369027272,52.04635822393588,49.21134156316832,0.3524436090225564,0.0071704357418643,0.5143603086471558,0.6868130383491515,0.6464351415634155,0.7485782504081726

The distribution of this training-test dataset segmentation followed a 50% distribution of PTSD and No PTSD from the original dataset. Our final survey based classification results showed an accuracy of 96% in detecting PTSD and mean squared error of 1.2 in estimating its intensity given we have four intensity, No PTSD, Low Risk PTSD, Moderate Risk PTSD and High Risk PTSD with a score of 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Table TABREF29 shows the classification details of our experiment which provide the very good accuracy of our classification. To compare the outperformance of our method, we also implemented Coppersmith et. al. proposed method and achieved an 86% overall accuracy of detecting PTSD users BIBREF11 following the same training-test dataset distribution. Fig FIGREF28 illustrates the comparisons between LAXARY and Coppersmith et. al. proposed method. Here we can see, the outperformance of our proposed method as well as the importance of $s-score$ estimation. We also illustrates the importance of $\alpha -score$ and $S-score$ in Fig FIGREF30.

13,How is the intensity of the PTSD established?,"Defined into four categories from high risk, moderate risk, to low risk.","There are many clinically validated PTSD assessment tools that are being used both to detect the prevalence of PTSD and its intensity among sufferers. Among all of the tools, the most popular and well accepted one is Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) Scale BIBREF15. This is a psychometric scale that assesses risk taking in five content domains: financial decisions (separately for investing versus gambling), health/safety, recreational, ethical, and social decisions. Respondents rate the likelihood that they would engage in domain-specific risky activities (Part I). An optional Part II assesses respondents' perceptions of the magnitude of the risks and expected benefits of the activities judged in Part I. There are more scales that are used in risky behavior analysis of individual's daily activities such as, The Berlin Social Support Scales (BSSS) BIBREF16 and Values In Action Scale (VIAS) BIBREF17. Dryhootch America BIBREF18, BIBREF19, a veteran peer support community organization, chooses 5, 6 and 5 questions respectively from the above mentioned survey systems to assess the PTSD among war veterans and consider rest of them as irrelevant to PTSD. The details of dryhootch chosen survey scale are stated in Table TABREF13. Table!TABREF14 shows a sample DOSPERT scale demographic chosen by dryhootch. The threshold (in Table TABREF13) is used to calculate the risky behavior limits. For example, if one individual's weekly DOSPERT score goes over 28, he is in critical situation in terms of risk taking symptoms of PTSD. Dryhootch defines the intensity of PTSD into four categories based on the weekly survey results of all three clinical survey tools (DOSPERT, BSSS and VIAS )
High risk PTSD: If one individual veteran's weekly PTSD assessment scores go above the threshold for all three PTSD assessment tools i.e. DOSPERT, BSSS and VIAS, then he/she is in high risk situation which needs immediate mental support to avoid catastrophic effect of individual's health or surrounding people's life.

We evaluate our model and baseline models on three versions of the dataset. The first one (Inc) only considers the original data, containing naturally incorrect tweets, and achieves accuracy of 80$\%$ against BERT's 72$\%$. The second version (Corr) considers the corrected tweets, and shows higher accuracy given that it is less noisy. In that version, Stacked DeBERT achieves 82$\%$ accuracy against BERT's 76$\%$, an improvement of 6$\%$. In the last case (Inc+Corr), we consider both incorrect and correct tweets as input to the models in hopes of improving performance. However, the accuracy was similar to the first aforementioned version, 80$\%$ for our model and 74$\%$ for the second highest performing model. Since the first and last corpus gave similar performances with our model, we conclude that the Twitter dataset does not require complete sentences to be given as training input, in addition to the original naturally incorrect tweets, in order to better model the noisy sentences.
Experimental results for the Intent Classification task on the Chatbot NLU Corpus with STT error can be seen in Table TABREF40.

17,Which experiments are perfomed?,They used BERT-based models to detect subjective language in the WNC corpus.,"In natural language, subjectivity refers to the aspects of communication used to express opinions, evaluations, and speculationsBIBREF0, often influenced by one's emotional state and viewpoints. Writers and editors of texts like news and textbooks try to avoid the use of biased language, yet subjective bias is pervasive in these texts. More than $56\%$ of Americans believe that news sources do not report the news objectively , thus implying the prevalence of the bias. Therefore, when presenting factual information, it becomes necessary to differentiate subjective language from objective language.
In this work, we investigate the application of BERT-based models for the task of subjective language detection. We explore various BERT-based models, including BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, with their base and large specifications along with their native classifiers. We propose an ensemble model exploiting predictions from these models using multiple ensembling techniques. We show that our model outperforms the baselines by a margin of $5.6$ of F1 score and $5.95\%$ of Accuracy.

We compare to the best n-gram-overlap metrics from toutanova2016dataset; combinations of linguistic units (bi-grams (LR2) and tri-grams (LR3)) and scoring measures (recall (R) and F-score (F)).

Exclusivity scores for each topic follows BIBREF7 . Highly frequent words in a given topic that do not appear very often in other topics are viewed as making that topic exclusive. Cohesive and exclusive topics are more semantically useful. Following BIBREF8 we generate a set of candidate models ranging between 3 and 50 topics. We then plot the exclusivity and semantic coherence (numbers closer to 0 indicate higher coherence), with a linear regression overlaid (Figure FIGREF3 ). Models above the regression line have a “better” exclusivity-semantic coherence trade off.

Domains include hotel, attraction, restaurant, metro, and taxi. The data collection process is summarized as below:
Database Construction: we crawled travel information in Beijing from the Web, including Hotel, Attraction, and Restaurant domains (hereafter we name the three domains as HAR domains). Then, we used the metro information of entities in HAR domains to build the metro database. For the taxi domain, there is no need to store the information. Instead, we can call the API directly if necessary.
Goal Generation: a multi-domain goal generator was designed based on the database. The relation across domains is captured in two ways. One is to constrain two targets that locate near each other. The other is to use a taxi or metro to commute between two targets in HAR domains mentioned in the context. To make workers understand the task more easily, we crafted templates to generate natural language descriptions for each structured goal.
Dialogue Collection: before the formal data collection starts, we required the workers to make a small number of dialogues and gave them feedback about the dialogue quality. Then, well-trained workers were paired to converse according to the given goals. The workers were also asked to annotate both user states and system states.
Dialogue Annotation: we used some rules to automatically annotate dialogue acts according to user states, system states, and dialogue histories. To evaluate the quality of the annotation of dialogue acts and states, three experts were employed to manually annotate dialogue acts and states for 50 dialogues. The results show that our annotations are of high quality.

35,What simpler models do they look at?,"BiGRUs with attention, ROUGE, Language model, and next sentence prediction.","Methods ::: Baselines ::: BiGRU s with attention:
This is very similar to Sum-QE but now $\mathcal {E}$ is a stack of BiGRU s with self-attention BIBREF21, instead of a BERT instance. The final summary representation ($h$) is the sum of the resulting context-aware token embeddings ($h = \sum _i a_i h_i$) weighted by their self-attention scores ($a_i$). We again have three flavors: one single-task (BiGRU-ATT-S-1) and two multi-task (BiGRU-ATT-M-1 and BiGRU-ATT-M-5).
Methods ::: Baselines ::: ROUGE:
This baseline is the ROUGE version that performs best on each dataset, among the versions considered by BIBREF13. Although ROUGE focuses on surface similarities between peer and reference summaries, we would expect properties like grammaticality, referential clarity and coherence to be captured to some extent by ROUGE versions based on long $n$-grams or longest common subsequences.
Methods ::: Baselines ::: Language model (LM):
For a peer summary, a reasonable estimate of $\mathcal {Q}1$ (Grammaticality) is the perplexity returned by a pre-trained language model. We experiment with the pre-trained GPT-2 model BIBREF22, and with the probability estimates that BERT can produce for each token when the token is treated as masked (BERT-FR-LM). Given that the grammaticality of a summary can be corrupted by just a few bad tokens, we compute the perplexity by considering only the $k$ worst (lowest LM probability) tokens of the peer summary, where $k$ is a tuned hyper-parameter.
Methods ::: Baselines ::: Next sentence prediction:
BERT training relies on two tasks: predicting masked tokens and next sentence prediction. The latter seems to be aligned with the definitions of $\mathcal {Q}3$ (Referential Clarity), $\mathcal {Q}4$ (Focus) and $\mathcal {Q}5$ (Structure & Coherence). Intuitively, when a sentence follows another with high probability, it should involve clear referential expressions and preserve the focus and local coherence of the text. We, therefore, use a pre-trained BERT model (BERT-FR-NS) to calculate the sentence-level perplexity of each summary:
where $p(s_i|s_{i-1})$ is the probability that BERT assigns to the sequence of sentences $\left< s_{i-1}, s \right>$, and $n$ is the number of sentences in the peer summary.","ROUGE, LM, Next sentence prediction.",0.3999999955555556,0.1538461495857989,0.3999999955555556,13.912311644176564,66.26215239297515,62.50113629209155,0.501827596710326,0.0082644628099173,0.7370163202285767,0.8337053986266255,0.7370162606239319,0.7679697871208191

This indicates that incorporating extra information can improve the knowledge graph embedding performance; (2) Four variants of KANE always outperform baseline methods. The main reasons why KANE works well are two fold: 1) KANE can capture high-order structural information of KGs in an efficient, explicit manner and passe these information to their neighboring; 2) KANE leverages rich information encoded in attribute triples. These rich semantic information can further improve the performance of knowledge graph; (3) The variant of KANE that use LSTM Encoder and Concatenation aggregator outperform other variants.

Several baselines rely on the retrieved context to extract the answer to a question. For these, we refer to the fraction of instances for which the correct answer is present in the context as Search Accuracy. The performance of the baseline among these instances is referred to as the Reading Accuracy, and the overall performance (which is a product of the two) is referred to as the Overall Accuracy. In Figure 4 we compare how these three vary as the number of context documents is varied.

One might think that classic retrieval models like language models for information retrieval BIBREF0 could solve these tasks. However, a big challenge for cQA tasks is that users are used to expressing similar meanings with different words, which creates gaps when matching questions based on common words. Other challenges include informal usage of language, highly diverse content of comments, and variation in the length of both questions and comments.
In our cQA tasks, the pair of objects are (question, question) or (question, comment), and the relationship is relevant/irrelevant. The left side of Figure 1 shows one intuitive way to predict relationships using RNNs. Parallel LSTMs encode two objects independently, and then concatenate their outputs as an input to a feed-forward neural network (FNN) with a softmax output layer for classification.
For task C, in addition to an original question (oriQ) and an external comment (relC), the question which relC commented on is also given (relQ).

Both original datasets share similar properties. Specifically, every data-point consists of a tuple, $\lbrace p, q, a\rbrace $, where $p$ represents a paragraph, $q$ a question, and $a$ is the answer. The answer is a word span defined by head and tail positions in $p$. NewsQA is more difficult than SQuAD because it has a larger vocabulary, more difficult questions, and longer source documents.
iMRC: Making MRC Interactive ::: Evaluation Metric
Since iMRC involves both MRC and RL, we adopt evaluation metrics from both settings. First, as a question answering task, we use $\text{F}_1$ score to compare predicted answers against ground-truth, as in previous works. When there exist multiple ground-truth answers, we report the max $\text{F}_1$ score. Second, mastering multiple games remains quite challenging for RL agents. Therefore, we evaluate an agent's performance during both its training and testing phases. During training, we report training curves averaged over 3 random seeds. During test, we follow common practice in supervised learning tasks where we report the agent's test performance corresponding to its best validation performance .",iMRC models.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.166666666666666,3.125000000000001,0.0,0.0011750881316098,0.2294752597808838,0.2760145068168641,0.2294752448797226,0.3915153443813324

53,"What difficulties does sentiment analysis on Twitter have, compared to sentiment analysis in other domains?","Tweets noisy nature, use of creative spelling and punctuation, misspellings, slang, new words, URLs, and genre-specific terminology and abbreviations, short (length limited) text.","Pre-processing. Tweets are subject to standard preprocessing steps for text such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop-word removal, and part-of-speech tagging. Moreover, due to their noisy nature, they are also processed using some Twitter-specific techniques such as substitution/removal of URLs, of user mentions, of hashtags, and of emoticons, spelling correction, elongation normalization, abbreviation lookup, punctuation removal, detection of amplifiers and diminishers, negation scope detection, etc. For this, one typically uses Twitter-specific NLP tools such as part-of-speech and named entity taggers, syntactic parsers, etc. BIBREF47 , BIBREF48 , BIBREF49 .
Despite all these opportunities, the rise of social media has also presented new challenges for natural language processing (NLP) applications, which had largely relied on NLP tools tuned for formal text genres such as newswire, and thus were not readily applicable to the informal language and style of social media. That language proved to be quite challenging with its use of creative spelling and punctuation, misspellings, slang, new words, URLs, and genre-specific terminology and abbreviations, e.g., RT for re-tweet and #hashtags. In addition to the genre difference, there is also a difference in length: social media messages are generally short, often length-limited by design as in Twitter, i.e., a sentence or a headline rather than a full document. How to handle such challenges has only recently been the subject of thorough research BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 .","Informal language, creative spelling, misspellings, slang, new words, URLs, and genre-specific terminology and abbreviations.",0.5294117599826991,0.4571428524734695,0.5294117599826991,46.12704651495161,77.97815327014816,77.04107783248165,0.5017944563494138,0.0106544901065449,0.7675771117210388,0.9178551059526174,0.767577052116394,0.7184295654296875

57,What semantic rules are proposed?,Rules that compute polarity of words after POS tagging or parsing steps.,"In Twitter social networking, people express their opinions containing sub-sentences. These sub-sentences using specific PoS particles (Conjunction and Conjunctive adverbs), like ""but, while, however, despite, however"" have different polarities. However, the overall sentiment of tweets often focus on certain sub-sentences. For example:
@lonedog bwahahah...you are amazing! However, it was quite the letdown.
@kirstiealley my dentist is great but she's expensive...=(
In two tweets above, the overall sentiment is negative. However, the main sentiment is only in the sub-sentences following but and however. This inspires a processing step to remove unessential parts in a tweet. Rule-based approach can assists these problems in handling negation and dealing with specific PoS particles led to effectively affect the final output of classification BIBREF11 BIBREF16 . BIBREF11 summarized a full presentation of their semantic rules approach and devised ten semantic rules in their hybrid approach based on the presentation of BIBREF16 . We use five rules in the semantic rules set because other five rules are only used to compute polarity of words after POS tagging or Parsing steps. We follow the same naming convention for rules utilized by BIBREF11 to represent the rules utilized in our proposed method.

61,What learning paradigms do they cover in this survey?,"Considering ""What"" and ""How"" separately versus jointly optimizing for both.","Past research took a reductionist approach, separately considering these two problems of “what” and “how” via content selection and question construction. Given a sentence or a paragraph as input, content selection selects a particular salient topic worthwhile to ask about and determines the question type (What, When, Who, etc.). Approaches either take a syntactic BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 or semantic BIBREF14 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 tack, both starting by applying syntactic or semantic parsing, respectively, to obtain intermediate symbolic representations. Question construction then converts intermediate representations to a natural language question, taking either a tranformation- or template-based approach. The former BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF13 rearranges the surface form of the input sentence to produce the question; the latter BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 generates questions from pre-defined question templates. Unfortunately, such QG architectures are limiting, as their representation is confined to the variety of intermediate representations, transformation rules or templates.
In contrast, neural models motivate an end-to-end architectures. Deep learned frameworks contrast with the reductionist approach, admitting approaches that jointly optimize for both the “what” and “how” in an unified framework. The majority of current NQG models follow the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) framework that use a unified representation and joint learning of content selection (via the encoder) and question construction (via the decoder). In this framework, traditional parsing-based content selection has been replaced by more flexible approaches such as attention BIBREF22 and copying mechanism BIBREF23 . Question construction has become completely data-driven, requiring far less labor compared to transformation rules, enabling better language flexibility compared to question templates.",Reductionist and end-to-end (neural) architectures.,0.133333328888889,0.0,0.133333328888889,3.1251907639724417,13.84570240374092,13.469257134802678,0.0699300699300699,0.005524861878453,0.2462866753339767,0.2531283323613691,0.2462866604328155,0.1218866184353828

where INLINEFORM0 is the lexicon weight of the term, and INLINEFORM1 represents the frequency of the term in the user generated INLINEFORM2 , and INLINEFORM3 measures total word count in INLINEFORM4 . As our data is biased toward young people, we report age prediction performance for each age group separately (Table TABREF42 ). Moreover, to measure the average accuracy of this model, we build a balanced dataset (keeping all the users above 23 -416 users), and then randomly sampling the same number of users from the age ranges (11,19] and (19,23].

64,What result from experiments suggest that natural language based agents are more robust?,Average reward across 5 seeds show that NLP representations are robust to changes in the environment as well task-nuisances.,"Results of the DQN-based agent are presented in fig: scenario comparison. Each plot depicts the average reward (across 5 seeds) of all representations methods. It can be seen that the NLP representation outperforms the other methods. This is contrary to the fact that it contains the same information as the semantic segmentation maps. More interestingly, comparing the vision-based and feature-based representations render inconsistent conclusions with respect to their relative performance. NLP representations remain robust to changes in the environment as well as task-nuisances in the state.

Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD)","To ground moral sentiment in text, we leverage the Moral Foundations Dictionary BIBREF27. The MFD is a psycholinguistic resource that associates each MFT category with a set of seed words, which are words that provide evidence for the corresponding moral category in text. We use the MFD for moral polarity classification by dividing seed words into positive and negative sets, and for fine-grained categorization by splitting them into the 10 MFT categories.
To implement the first tier of our framework and detect moral relevance, we complement our morally relevant seed words with a corresponding set of seed words approximating moral irrelevance based on the notion of valence, i.e., the degree of pleasantness or unpleasantness of a stimulus. We refer to the emotional valence ratings collected by BIBREF28 for approximately 14,000 English words, and choose the words with most neutral valence rating that do not occur in the MFD as our set of morally irrelevant seed words, for an equal total number of morally relevant and morally irrelevant words.

This dataset was collected through Mechanical Turk using 100 simulated environments with a corresponding topological map and, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first of its kind for behavioral navigation. The dataset opens up opportunities to explore data-driven methods for grounding navigation commands into high-level motion plans.
We created a new dataset for the problem of following navigation instructions under the behavioral navigation framework of BIBREF5 . This dataset was created using Amazon Mechanical Turk and 100 maps of simulated indoor environments, each with 6 to 65 rooms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark for comparing translation models in the context of behavioral robot navigation.
As shown in Table TABREF16 , the dataset consists of 8066 pairs of free-form natural language instructions and navigation plans for training. This training data was collected from 88 unique simulated environments, totaling 6064 distinct navigation plans (2002 plans have two different navigation instructions each; the rest has one). The dataset contains two test set variants:
While the dataset was collected with simulated environments, no structure was imposed on the navigation instructions while crowd-sourcing data. Thus, many instructions in our dataset are ambiguous. Moreover, the order of the behaviors in the instructions is not always the same. For instance, a person said “turn right and advance” to describe part of a route, while another person said “go straight after turning right” in a similar situation. The high variability present in the natural language descriptions of our dataset makes the problem of decoding instructions into behaviors not trivial.

77,How is morphology knowledge implemented in the method?,A BPE model is applied to the stem after morpheme segmentation.,"The problem with morpheme segmentation is that the vocabulary of stem units is still very large, which leads to many rare and unknown words at the training time. The problem with BPE is that it do not consider the morpheme boundaries inside words, which might cause a loss of morphological properties and semantic information. Hence, on the analyses of the above popular word segmentation methods, we propose the morphologically motivated segmentation strategy that combines the morpheme segmentation and BPE for further improving the translation performance of NMT.
Compared with the sentence of word surface forms, the corresponding sentence of stem units only contains the structure information without considering morphological information, which can make better generalization over inflectional variants of the same word and reduce data sparseness BIBREF8. Therefore, we learn a BPE model on the stem units in the training corpus rather than the words, and then apply it on the stem unit of each word after morpheme segmentation.","Morpheme segmentation is used to extract stem units, then BPE is applied on these units.",0.479999995072,0.0833333284722225,0.239999995072,6.10719615202126,43.73623666779133,39.10435664392384,0.505,0.0123456790123456,0.8140894770622253,0.7590645275063278,0.8140893578529358,0.8708999752998352
78,How is the performance on the task evaluated?,Comparison of test accuracies of neural network models on an inflection task and qualitative analysis of the errors.,"Neural network models, and specifically sequence-to-sequence models, have pushed the state of the art for morphological inflection – the task of learning a mapping from lemmata to their inflected forms – in the last years BIBREF6. Thus, in this work, we experiment on such models, asking not what they learn, but, motivated by the respective research on human subjects, the related question of how what they learn depends on their prior knowledge. We manually investigate the errors made by artificial neural networks for morphological inflection in a target language after pretraining on different source languages. We aim at finding answers to two main questions: (i) Do errors systematically differ between source languages? (ii) Do these differences seem explainable, given the properties of the source and target languages? In other words, we are interested in exploring if and how L2 acquisition of morphological inflection depends on the L1, i.e., the ""native language"", in neural network models.
For our qualitative analysis, we make use of the validation set. Therefore, we show validation set accuracies in Table TABREF19 for comparison.

Yet, gender stereotypes also exist in other languages because they are a function of society, not of grammar. Moreover, because English does not mark grammatical gender, approaches developed for English are not transferable to morphologically rich languages that exhibit gender agreement BIBREF8 . In these languages, the words in a sentence are marked with morphological endings that reflect the grammatical gender of the surrounding nouns. This means that if the gender of one word changes, the others have to be updated to match. As a result, simple heuristics, such as augmenting a corpus with additional sentences in which he and she have been swapped BIBREF9 , will yield ungrammatical sentences.

The experimental results are presented in Figure FIGREF37. Taken as a whole, it is very surprising to observe that none of these methods can be consistently superior to the others. The experimental results on BERT-based models show the same trend. Diving deep into the methods only using recent questions as context, we observe that Concat and Turn perform competitively, outperforming Gate by a large margin. With respect to the methods only using precedent SQL as context, Action Copy significantly surpasses Tree Copy and SQL Attn in all metrics. In addition, we observe that there is little difference in the performance of Action Copy and Concat, which implies that using precedent SQL as context gives almost the same effect with using recent questions. In terms of the combinations of different context modeling methods, they do not significantly improve the performance as we expected.

85,Is the baseline a non-heirarchical model like BERT?,There were hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines; BERT was one of those baselines.,"FLOAT SELECTED: Table 1: Results of various models on the CNNDM test set using full-length F1 ROUGE-1 (R-1), ROUGE-2 (R2), and ROUGE-L (R-L).
Our main results on the CNNDM dataset are shown in Table 1 , with abstractive models in the top block and extractive models in the bottom block. Pointer+Coverage BIBREF9 , Abstract-ML+RL BIBREF10 and DCA BIBREF42 are all sequence to sequence learning based models with copy and coverage modeling, reinforcement learning and deep communicating agents extensions. SentRewrite BIBREF26 and InconsisLoss BIBREF25 all try to decompose the word by word summary generation into sentence selection from document and “sentence” level summarization (or compression). Bottom-Up BIBREF27 generates summaries by combines a word prediction model with the decoder attention model. The extractive models are usually based on hierarchical encoders (SummaRuNNer; BIBREF3 and NeuSum; BIBREF11 ). They have been extended with reinforcement learning (Refresh; BIBREF4 and BanditSum; BIBREF20 ), Maximal Marginal Relevance (NeuSum-MMR; BIBREF21 ), latent variable modeling (LatentSum; BIBREF5 ) and syntactic compression (JECS; BIBREF38 ). Lead3 is a baseline which simply selects the first three sentences. Our model $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$ (in-domain), which only use one pre-training stage on the in-domain CNNDM training set, outperforms all of them and differences between them are all significant with a 0.95 confidence interval (estimated with the ROUGE script). Note that pre-training $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$ (in-domain) is very fast and it only takes around 30 minutes for one epoch on the CNNDM training set. Our models with two pre-training stages ( $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$ ) or larger size ( $\text{\sc Hibert}_M$ ) perform even better and $\text{\sc Hibert}_M$ outperforms BERT by 0.5 ROUGE. We also implemented two baselines. One is the hierarchical transformer summarization model (HeriTransfomer; described in ""Extractive Summarization"" ) without pre-training. Note the setting for HeriTransfomer is ( $L=4$ , $H=300$ and $A=4$ ) . We can see that the pre-training (details in Section ""Pre-training"" ) leads to a +1.25 ROUGE improvement. Another baseline is based on a pre-trained BERT BIBREF0 and finetuned on the CNNDM dataset. We used the $\text{BERT}_{\text{base}}$ model because our 16G RAM V100 GPU cannot fit $\text{BERT}_{\text{large}}$ for the summarization task even with batch size of 1. The positional embedding of BERT supports input length up to 512 words, we therefore split documents with more than 10 sentences into multiple blocks (each block with 10 sentences). We feed each block (the BOS and EOS tokens of each sentence are replaced with [CLS] and [SEP] tokens) into BERT and use the representation at [CLS] token to classify each sentence. Our model $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$1 outperforms BERT by 0.4 to 0.5 ROUGE despite with only half the number of model parameters ( $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$2 54.6M v.s. BERT 110M). Results on the NYT50 dataset show the similar trends (see Table 2 ). EXTRACTION is a extractive model based hierarchical LSTM and we use the numbers reported by xu:2019:arxiv. The improvement of $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$3 over the baseline without pre-training (HeriTransformer) becomes 2.0 ROUGE. $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$4 (in-domain), $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$5 (in-domain), $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$6 and $\text{\sc Hibert}_S$7 all outperform BERT significantly according to the ROUGE script.",No.,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.839838722567789,3.745318352059925,7.3018080667593885,0.0390625,0.0008326394671107,0.0651456788182258,0.12021055072546,0.0651456788182258,
86,How better are results compared to baseline models?,F1 score of best authors' model is 55.98 compared to BiLSTM and FastText that have F1 score slighlty higher than 46.61.,"We see that parent quality is a simple yet effective feature and SVM model with this feature can achieve significantly higher ($p<0.001$) F1 score ($46.61\%$) than distance from the thesis and linguistic features. Claims with higher impact parents are more likely to be have higher impact. Similarity with the parent and thesis is not significantly better than the majority baseline. Although the BiLSTM model with attention and FastText baselines performs better than the SVM with distance from the thesis and linguistic features, it has similar performance to the parent quality baseline.
We find that the flat representation of the context achieves the highest F1 score. It may be more difficult for the models with a larger number of parameters to perform better than the flat representation since the dataset is small. We also observe that modeling 3 claims on the argument path before the target claim achieves the best F1 score ($55.98\%$).",Significantly better ($p<0.001$) with an F1 score of 46.61%.,0.2499999954882813,0.1290322536940688,0.2499999954882813,7.305267243289862,25.23739362513101,24.685861121982104,0.1903521825396825,0.0047145102147721,0.6659846901893616,0.5830863912900288,0.6659846901893616,0.7946154475212097
87,What geometric properties do embeddings display?,Winter and summer words formed two separate clusters. Week day and week-end day words also formed separate clusters.,"The initial analyses of the embedding matrices for both the UK and France revealed that in general, words were grouped by context or influence on the electricity consumption. For instance, we observed that winter words were together and far away from summer ones. Week days were grouped as well and far from week-end days. However considering the vocabulary was reduced to $V^* = 52$ words, those results lacked of consistency. Therefore for both languages we decided to re-train the RNNs using the same architecture, but with a larger vocabulary of the $V=300$ most relevant words (still in the RF sense) and on all the available data (i.e. everything is used as training) to compensate for the increased size of the vocabulary. We then calculated the distance of a few prominent words to the others. The analysis of the average cosine distance over $B=10$ runs for three major words is given by tables TABREF38 and TABREF39, and three other examples are given in the appendix tables TABREF57 and TABREF58. The first row corresponds to the reference word vector $\overrightarrow{w_1}$ used to calculate the distance from (thus the distance is always zero), while the following ones are the 9 closest to it. The two last rows correspond to words we deemed important to check the distance with (an antagonistic one or relevant one not in the top 9 for instance).",Geometric properties of embeddings display grouping by context or influence.,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.9146030690102511,15.03988663638642,12.264081226786557,0.0261780104712041,0.005524861878453,0.2176627069711685,0.408861674575342,0.2559913396835327,0.1927670985460281

93,How was quality measured?,"Inter-annotator agreement, comparison against expert annotation, agreement with PropBank Data annotations.","Dataset Quality Analysis ::: Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA)
To estimate dataset consistency across different annotations, we measure F1 using our UA metric with 5 generators per predicate. Individual worker-vs-worker agreement yields 79.8 F1 over 10 experiments with 150 predicates, indicating high consistency across our annotators, inline with results by other structured semantic annotations (e.g. BIBREF6). Overall consistency of the dataset is assessed by measuring agreement between different consolidated annotations, obtained by disjoint triplets of workers, which achieves F1 of 84.1 over 4 experiments, each with 35 distinct predicates. Notably, consolidation boosts agreement, suggesting it is a necessity for semantic annotation consistency.
Dataset Quality Analysis ::: Dataset Assessment and Comparison
We assess both our gold standard set and the recent Dense set against an integrated expert annotated sample of 100 predicates. To construct the expert set, we blindly merged the Dense set with our worker annotations and manually corrected them. We further corrected the evaluation decisions, accounting for some automatic evaluation mistakes introduced by the span-matching and question paraphrasing criteria. As seen in Table TABREF19, our gold set yields comparable precision with significantly higher recall, which is in line with our 25% higher yield.
Dataset Quality Analysis ::: Agreement with PropBank Data
It is illuminating to observe the agreement between QA-SRL and PropBank (CoNLL-2009) annotations BIBREF7. In Table TABREF22, we replicate the experiments in BIBREF4 for both our gold set and theirs, over a sample of 200 sentences from Wall Street Journal (agreement evaluation is automatic and the metric is somewhat similar to our UA).

In this consolidation task, the worker validates questions, merges, splits or modifies answers for the same role according to guidelines, and removes redundant roles by picking the more naturally phrased questions. For example, in Table TABREF4 ex. 1, one worker could have chosen “47 people”, while another chose “the councillor”; in this case the consolidator would include both of those answers.

103,What dataset do they use?,They used Wiki Vietnamese language and Vietnamese newspapers to pretrain embeddings and dataset provided in HSD task to train model (details not mentioned in paper).,"The fundamental idea of this system is how to make a system that has the diversity of viewing an input. That because of the variety of the meaning in Vietnamese language especially with the acronym, teen code type. To make this diversity, after cleaning raw text input, we use multiple types of word tokenizers. Each one of these tokenizers, we combine with some types of representation methods, including word to vector methods such as continuous bag of words BIBREF5, pre-trained embedding as fasttext (trained on Wiki Vietnamese language) BIBREF6 and sonvx (trained on Vietnamese newspaper) BIBREF7. Each sentence has a set of words corresponding to a set of word vectors, and that set of word vectors is a representation of a sentence. We also make a sentence embedding by using RoBERTa architecture BIBREF8. CBOW and RoBERTa models trained on text from some resources including VLSP 2016 Sentiment Analysis, VLSP 2018 Sentiment Analysis, VLSP 2019 HSD and text crawled from Facebook. After having sentence representation, we use some classification models to classify input sentences. Those models will be described in detail in the section SECREF13. With the multiply output results, we will use an ensemble method to combine them and output the final result. Ensemble method we use here is Stacking method will be introduced in the section SECREF16.
The dataset in this HSD task is really imbalance. Clean class dominates with 91.5%, offensive class takes 5% and the rest belongs to hate class with 3.5%. To make model being able to learn with this imbalance data, we inject class weight to the loss function with the corresponding ratio (clean, offensive, hate) is $(0.09, 0.95, 0.96)$. Formular DISPLAY_FORM17 is the loss function apply for all models in our system. $w_i$ is the class weight, $y_i$ is the ground truth and $\hat{y}_i$ is the output of the model. If the class weight is not set, we find that model cannot adjust parameters. The model tends to output all clean classes.","VLSP 2016 Sentiment Analysis, VLSP 2018 Sentiment Analysis, VLSP 2019 HSD and text crawled from Facebook.",0.1212121165840222,0.0,0.0606060559779617,1.7574239156849023,13.026432462285689,11.593248710564406,0.055350553505535,0.0066225165562913,0.2899829149246216,0.3899107416174305,0.2899829149246216,0.1360548436641693
104,Do the use word embeddings alone or they replace some previous features of the model with word embeddings?,They use it as addition to previous model - they add new edge between words if word embeddings are similar.,"While the co-occurrence representation yields good results in classification scenarios, some important features are not considered in the model. For example, long-range syntactical links, though less frequent than adjacent syntactical relationships, might be disregarded from a simple word adjacency approach BIBREF12. In addition, semantically similar words not sharing the same lemma are mapped into distinct nodes. In order to address these issues, here we introduce a modification of the traditional network representation by establishing additional edges, referred to as “virtual” edges. In the proposed model, in addition to the co-occurrence edges, we link two nodes (words) if the corresponding word embedding representation is similar. While this approach still does not merge similar nodes into the same concept, similar nodes are explicitly linked via virtual edges.",They replace some previous features of the model with word embeddings.,0.3225806405827263,0.0689655127229491,0.3225806405827263,4.780204393760627,41.71098551270505,37.72675977928652,0.2121337755666113,0.0064289888953828,0.8306136727333069,0.7672728329896927,0.8306136727333069,0.7814583778381348

The dataset (composed of 2.6 GB of raw text) includes $421\,829\,960$ words divided into $17\,305\,401$ sentences.
The text was previously preprocessed by removing the words whose absolute frequency was less than 5 and eliminating all special characters. Since it is impossible to represent every imaginable numerical value, but not wanting to eliminate the concept of “numerical representation"" linked to certain words, it was also decided to replace every number present in the text with the particular $\langle NUM \rangle $ token; which probably also assumes a better representation in the embedding space (not separating into the various possible values). All the words were then transformed to lowercase (to avoid a double presence) finally producing a vocabulary of $618\,224$ words.","The answer is a dump of the Italian Wikipedia, Italian Google News, and anonymized chats between users and a customer care chatbot.",0.2580645113839751,0.0,0.129032253319459,3.992482095783709,28.839741073641942,26.70348257698652,0.3377407300948548,0.0108803165182987,0.5490372180938721,0.6201164837181568,0.5490372776985168,0.5342413783073425

(The spread of causal statements will be considered in future work.) We considered only English-language tweets for this study. To avoid cross-language effects, we kept only tweets with a user-reported language of `English' and, as a second constraint, individual tweets needed to match more English stopwords than any other language's set of stopwords.

111,What are resolution model variables?,"Variables in the set {str, prec, attr} indicating in which mode the mention should be resolved.","According to previous work BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF1 , antecedents are resolved by different categories of information for different mentions. For example, the Stanford system BIBREF1 uses string-matching sieves to link two mentions with similar text and precise-construct sieve to link two mentions which satisfy special syntactic or semantic relations such as apposition or acronym. Motivated by this, we introduce resolution mode variables $\Pi = \lbrace \pi _1, \ldots , \pi _n\rbrace $ , where for each mention $j$ the variable $\pi _j \in \lbrace str, prec, attr\rbrace $ indicates in which mode the mention should be resolved. In our model, we define three resolution modes — string-matching (str), precise-construct (prec), and attribute-matching (attr) — and $\Pi $ is deterministic when $D$ is given (i.e. $P(\Pi |D)$ is a point distribution). We determine $\pi _j$ for each mention $m_j$ in the following way:
$\pi _j = str$ , if there exists a mention $m_i, i < j$ such that the two mentions satisfy the String Match sieve, the Relaxed String Match sieve, or the Strict Head Match A sieve in the Stanford multi-sieve system BIBREF1 .
$\pi _j = prec$ , if there exists a mention $m_i, i < j$ such that the two mentions satisfy the Speaker Identification sieve, or the Precise Constructs sieve.

116,How are the EAU text spans annotated?,Answer with content missing: (Data and pre-processing section) The data is suited for our experiments because the annotators were explicitly asked to provide annotations on a clausal level.,"Tree-based sentiment annotations are sentiment scores assigned to nodes in constituency parse trees BIBREF26 . We represent these scores by a one-hot vector of dimension 5 (5 is very positive, 1 is very negative). We determine the contextual ( INLINEFORM0 ) sentiment by looking at the highest possible node of the context which does not contain the EAU (ADVP in Figure FIGREF26 ). The sentiment for an EAU span ( INLINEFORM1 ) is assigned to the highest possible node covering the EAU span which does not contain the context sub-tree (S in Figure FIGREF26 ). The full-access ( INLINEFORM2 ) score is assigned to the lowest possible node which covers both the EAU span and its surrounding context (S' in Figure FIGREF26 ). Next to the sentiment scores for the selected tree nodes and analogously to the word embeddings, we also calculate the element-wise subtraction of the one-hot sentiment source vectors from the one-hot sentiment target vectors. This results in three additional vectors corresponding to INLINEFORM3 , INLINEFORM4 and INLINEFORM5 difference vectors.

117,Which Twitter corpus was used to train the word vectors?,They collected tweets in Russian language using a heuristic query specific to Russian.,"Twitter provides well-documented API, which allows to request any information about Tweets, users and their profiles, with respect to rate limits. There is special type of API, called Streaming API, that provides a real-time stream of tweets. The key difference with regular API is that connection is kept alive as long as possible, and Tweets are sent in real-time to the client. There are three endpoints of Streaming API of our interest: “sample”, “filter” and “firehose”. The first one provides a sample (random subset) of the full Tweet stream. The second one allows to receive Tweets matching some search criteria: matching to one or more search keywords, produced by subset of users, or coming from certain geo location. The last one provides the full set of Tweets, although it is not available by default. In order to get Twitter “firehose” one can contact Twitter, or buy this stream from third-parties.
In our case the simplest approach would be to use “sample” endpoint, but it provides Tweets in all possible languages from all over the World, while we are concerned only about one language (Russian). In order to use this endpoint we implemented filtering based on language. The filter is simple: if Tweet does not contain a substring of 3 or more cyrillic symbols, it is considered non-Russian. Although this approach keeps Tweets in Mongolian, Ukrainian and other slavic languages (because they use cyrillic alphabet), the total amount of false-positives in this case is negligible. To demonstrate this we conducted simple experiment: on a random sample of 200 tweets only 5 were in a language different from Russian. In order not to rely on Twitter language detection, we chose to proceed with this method of language-based filtering.
However, the amount of Tweets received through “sample” endpoint was not satisfying. This is probably because “sample” endpoint always streams the same content to all its clients, and small portion of it comes in Russian language. In order to force mining of Tweets in Russian language, we chose ""filter"" endpoint, which requires some search query. We constructed heuristic query, containing some auxiliary words, specific to Russian language: conjunctions, pronouns, prepositions. The full list is as follows:

Average cosine similarity score: 0.650 vs 0.388
Average semantic relatedness similarity score between countries and their capitals: 0.663 vs 0.391.","Generally, closer words are considered more important to a word’s meaning. The word embeddings models have the ability to capture the lexical relations between words. Identifying such relationship that connects words is important in NLP applications. We measure that semantic relationship by calculating the dot product of two vectors using Eq. DISPLAY_FORM48. The high cosine similarity score denotes the closer words in the embedding matrix, while less cosine similarity score means the higher distance between word pairs. We present the cosine similarity score of different semantically or syntactically related word pairs taken from the vocabulary in Table TABREF77 along with English translation, which shows the average similarity of 0.632, 0.650, 0.591 yields by CBoW, SG and GloVe respectively. The SG model achieved a high average similarity score of 0.650 followed by CBoW with a 0.632 average similarity score. The GloVe also achieved a considerable average score of 0.591 respectively. However, the average similarity score of SdfastText is 0.388 and the word pair Microsoft-Bill Gates is not available in the vocabulary of SdfastText. This shows that along with performance, the vocabulary in SdfastText is also limited as compared to our proposed word embeddings.
Moreover, the average semantic relatedness similarity score between countries and their capitals is shown in Table TABREF78 with English translation, where SG also yields the best average score of 0.663 followed by CBoW with 0.611 similarity score.

This is a study of the trade-off between computational time and representational power. A large $K$ allows us to compute complex source representations, while a $K$ of 1 limits the source representation to a single vector. We can see that performance consistently increases with $K$ up to a point that depends on the data length, with longer sequences requiring more complex representations. The results with and without position encodings are almost identical on the toy data. Our technique learns to fit the data as well as the standard attention mechanism despite having less representational power. Both beat the non-attention baseline by a significant margin.
All models are implemented using TensorFlow based on the seq2seq implementation of BIBREF15 and trained on a single machine with a Nvidia K40m GPU.

124,How do they enrich the positional embedding with length information,They introduce new trigonometric encoding which besides information about position uses additional length information (abs or relative).,"Methods ::: Length Encoding Method
Inspired by BIBREF11, we use length encoding to provide the network with information about the remaining sentence length during decoding. We propose two types of length encoding: absolute and relative. Let pos and len be, respectively, a token position and the end of the sequence, both expressed in terms of number characters. Then, the absolute approach encodes the remaining length:
where $i=1,\ldots ,d/2$.
Similarly, the relative difference encodes the relative position to the end. This representation is made consistent with the absolute encoding by quantizing the space of the relative positions into a finite set of $N$ integers:
where $q_N: [0, 1] \rightarrow \lbrace 0, 1, .., N\rbrace $ is simply defined as $q_N(x) = \lfloor {x \times N}\rfloor $. As we are interested in the character length of the target sequence, len and pos are given in terms of characters, but we represent the sequence as a sequence of BPE-segmented subwords BIBREF17. To solve the ambiguity, len is the character length of the sequence, while pos is the character count of all the preceding tokens. We prefer a representation based on BPE, unlike BIBREF11, as it leads to better translations with less training time BIBREF18, BIBREF19. During training, len is the observed length of the target sentence, while at inference time it is the length of the source sentence, as it is the length that we aim to match. The process is exemplified in Figure FIGREF9.",They use length encoding.,0.2999999968,0.0,0.1999999968,2.707657626755448,30.071770473330027,29.190941810835003,0.1351351351351351,0.0026595744680851,0.6407842636108398,0.7458830952644349,0.6407842636108398,0.614436686038971
125,How do they condition the output to a given target-source class?,"They use three groups short/normal/long translation classes to learn length token, which is in inference used to bias network to generate desired length group.","Methods ::: Length Token Method
Our first approach to control the length is inspired by target forcing in multilingual NMT BIBREF15, BIBREF16. We first split the training sentence pairs into three groups according to the target/source length ratio (in terms of characters). Ideally, we want a group where the target is shorter than the source (short), one where they are equally-sized (normal) and a last group where the target is longer than the source (long). In practice, we select two thresholds $t_\text{min}$ and $t_\text{max}$ according to the length ratio distribution. All the sentence pairs with length ratio between $t_\text{min}$ and $t_\text{max}$ are in the normal group, the ones with ratio below $t_\text{min}$ in short and the remaining in long. At training time we prepend a length token to each source sentence according to its group ($<$short$>$, $<$normal$>$, or $<$long$>$), in order to let a single network to discriminate between the groups (see Figure FIGREF2). At inference time, the length token is used to bias the network to generate a translation that belongs to the desired length group.",By prepending a length token to each source sentence according to its group.,0.1818181771900827,0.0,0.1818181771900827,3.886087300370252,30.2567238126294,28.90987634267709,0.1719310035842294,0.0061523899668717,0.4577228426933288,0.6803666400235324,0.4577228426933288,0.7010043263435364
126,How does this compare to traditional calibration methods like Platt Scaling?,No reliability diagrams are provided and no explicit comparison is made between confidence scores or methods.,"Compared to using external models for confidence modeling, an advantage of the proposed method is that the base model does not change: the binary classification loss just provides additional supervision. Ideally, the resulting model after one-round of training becomes better not only at confidence modeling, but also at assertion generation, suggesting that extractions of higher quality can be added as training samples to continue this training process iteratively. The resulting iterative learning procedure (alg:iter) incrementally includes extractions generated by the current model as training samples to optimize the binary classification loss to obtain a better model, and this procedure is continued until convergence. [t] training data $\mathcal {D}$ , initial model $\theta ^{(0)}$ model after convergence $\theta $ $t \leftarrow 0$ # iteration
A key step in open IE is confidence modeling, which ranks a list of candidate extractions based on their estimated quality. This is important for downstream tasks, which rely on trade-offs between the precision and recall of extracted assertions. For instance, an open IE-powered medical question answering (QA) system may require its assertions in higher precision (and consequently lower recall) than QA systems for other domains. For supervised open IE systems, the confidence score of an assertion is typically computed based on its extraction likelihood given by the model BIBREF3 , BIBREF5 . However, we observe that this often yields sub-optimal ranking results, with incorrect extractions of one sentence having higher likelihood than correct extractions of another sentence. We hypothesize this is due to the issue of a disconnect between training and test-time objectives. Specifically, the system is trained solely to raise likelihood of gold-standard extractions, and during training the model is not aware of its test-time behavior of ranking a set of system-generated assertions across sentences that potentially include incorrect extractions.
We follow the evaluation metrics described by Stanovsky:2016:OIE2016: area under the precision-recall curve (AUC) and F1 score. An extraction is judged as correct if the predicate and arguments include the syntactic head of the gold standard counterparts.","It does not change the base model, whereas Platt Scaling requires a separate model.",0.0,0.0,0.0,2.2869567780619007,18.581581139977946,14.715405724822908,0.029585798816568,0.0086741016109045,0.161300241947174,0.4528587396655764,0.1613002270460128,0.3317406475543976
127,"Is CRWIZ already used for data collection, what are the results?","Yes, CRWIZ has been used for data collection and its initial use resulted in 145 dialogues. The average time taken for the task was close to the estimate of 10 minutes, 14 dialogues (9.66%) resolved the emergency in the scenario, and these dialogues rated consistently higher in subjective and objective ratings than those which did not resolve the emergency. Qualitative results showed that participants believed that they were interacting with an automated assistant.","For the intitial data collection using the CRWIZ platform, 145 unique dialogues were collected (each dialogue consists of a conversation between two participants). All the dialogues were manually checked by one of the authors and those where the workers were clearly not partaking in the task or collaborating were removed from the dataset. The average time per assignment was 10 minutes 47 seconds, very close to our initial estimate of 10 minutes, and the task was available for 5 days in AMT. Out of the 145 dialogues, 14 (9.66%) obtained the bonus of $0.2 for resolving the emergency. We predicted that only a small portion of the participants would be able to resolve the emergency in less than 6 minutes, thus it was framed as a bonus challenge rather than a requirement to get paid. The fastest time recorded to resolve the emergency was 4 minutes 13 seconds with a mean of 5 minutes 8 seconds. Table TABREF28 shows several interaction statistics for the data collected compared to the single lab-based WoZ study BIBREF4.
Data Analysis ::: Subjective Data
Table TABREF33 gives the results from the post-task survey. We observe, that subjective and objective task success are similar in that the dialogues that resolved the emergency were rated consistently higher than the rest.
Mann-Whitney-U one-tailed tests show that the scores of the Emergency Resolved Dialogues for Q1 and Q2 were significantly higher than the scores of the Emergency Not Resolved Dialogues at the 95% confidence level (Q1: $U = 1654.5$, $p < 0.0001$; Q2: $U = 2195$, $p = 0.009$, both $p < 0.05$). This indicates that effective collaboration and information ease are key to task completion in this setting.
Regarding the qualitative data, one of the objectives of the Wizard-of-Oz technique was to make the participant believe that they are interacting with an automated agent and the qualitative feedback seemed to reflect this: “The AI in the game was not helpful at all [...]” or “I was talking to Fred a bot assistant, I had no other partner in the game“.
Data Analysis ::: Single vs Multiple Wizards
In Table TABREF28, we compare various metrics from the dialogues collected with crowdsourcing with the dialogues previously collected in a lab environment for a similar task. Most figures are comparable, except the number of emergency assistant turns (and consequently the total number of turns). To further understand these differences, we have first grouped the dialogue acts in four different broader types: Updates, Actions, Interactions and Requests, and computed the relative frequency of each of these types in both data collections. In addition, Figures FIGREF29 and FIGREF30 show the distribution of the most frequent dialogue acts in the different settings. It is visible that in the lab setting where the interaction was face-to-face with a robot, the Wizard used more Interaction dialogue acts (Table TABREF32). These were often used in context where the Wizard needed to hold the turn while looking for the appropriate prompt or waiting for the robot to arrive at the specified goal in the environment. On the other hand, in the crowdsourced data collection utterances, the situation updates were a more common choice while the assistant was waiting for the robot to travel to the specified goal in the environment.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the data shows a medium strong positive correlation between task success and the number of Action type dialogue acts the Wizard performs, triggering events in the world leading to success ($R=0.475$). There is also a positive correlation between task success and the number of Request dialogue acts requesting confirmation before actions ($R=0.421$), e.g., “Which robot do you want to send?”. As Table 3 shows, these are relatively rare but perhaps reflect a level of collaboration needed to further the task to completion. Table TABREF40 shows one of the dialogues collected where the Emergency Assistant continuously engaged with the Operator through these types of dialogue acts.
The task success rate was also very different between the two set-ups. In experiments reported in BIBREF4, 96% of the dialogues led to the extinction of the fire whereas in the crowdsourcing setting only 9.66% achieved the same goal. In the crowdsourced setting, the robots were slower moving at realistic speeds unlike the lab setting. A higher bonus and more time for the task might lead to a higher task success rate.
Data Analysis ::: Limitations
It is important to consider the number of available participants ready and willing to perform the task at any one time. This type of crowdsourcing requires two participants to connect within a few minutes of each other to be partnered together. As mentioned above, there were some issues with participants not collaborating and these dialogues had to be discarded as they were not of use.","Yes, CRWIZ was used for data collection, and 145 unique dialogues were collected.",0.2702702673739956,0.0714285689795919,0.2432432403469686,4.949896838203951,31.78071789799894,32.64508742147847,0.111344935852325,0.0020271323873382,0.785336971282959,0.717285145761629,0.9418037533760072,0.4994159042835235

130,How is the fluctuation in the sense of the word and its neighbors measured?,"Our method performs a statistical test to determine whether a given word is used polysemously in the text, according to the following steps:
1) Setting N, the size of the neighbor.
2) Choosing N neighboring words ai in the order whose angle with the vector of the given word w is the smallest.
3) Computing the surrounding uniformity for ai(0 < i ≤ N) and w.
4) Computing the mean m and the sample variance σ for the uniformities of ai .
5) Checking whether the uniformity of w is less than m − 3σ. If the value is less than m − 3σ, we may regard w as a polysemic word.","Distributed representation of word sense provides us with the ability to perform several operations on the word. One of the most important operations on a word is to obtain the set of words whose meaning is similar to the word, or whose usage in text is similar to the word. We call this set the neighbor of the word. When a word has several senses, it is called a polysemic word. When a word has only one sense, it is called a monosemic word. We have observed that the neighbor of a polysemic word consists of words that resemble the primary sense of the polysemic word. We can explain this fact as follows. Even though a word may be a polysemic, it usually corresponds to a single vector in distributed representation. This vector is primarily determined by the major sense, which is most frequently used. The information about a word's minor sense is subtle, and the effect of a minor sense is difficult to distinguish from statistical fluctuation.
To measure the effect of a minor sense, this paper proposes to use the concept of surrounding uniformity. The surrounding uniformity roughly corresponds to statistical fluctuation in the vectors that correspond to the words in the neighbor. We have found that there is a difference in the surrounding uniformity between a monosemic word and a polysemic word. This paper describes how to compute surrounding uniformity for a given word, and discuss the relationship between surrounding uniformity and polysemy.
We choose the uniformity of vectors, which can be regarded as general case of triangle inequality. The uniformity of a set of vectors is a ratio, i.e., the size of the vector of the vector addition of the vectors divided by the scalar sum of the sizes of the vectors. If and only if all directions of the vectors are the same, the uniformity becomes 1.0. We compute this uniformity for the neighbors, including the word itself. Surrounding Uniformity (SU) can be expressed as follows: $SU(\vec{w}) = \frac{|\vec{s}(\vec{w})|}{|\vec{w}| + \sum _{i}^{N}|\vec{a_i}(\vec{w})|}$
where $\vec{s}(\vec{w}) = \vec{w} + \sum _{i}^{N} \vec{a_i}(\vec{w}).$",Surrounding Uniformity (SU).,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3649571140312405,13.295405830452092,10.42419834571904,0.0215889464594127,0.0002726529128419,0.2040733247995376,0.8010211325273281,0.4037778079509735,0.2941121160984039

Both Pointer-Generator and Transformer achieve high ROUGE scores, but a relative low CIC scores. It suggests that the baselines have more room for improvement on preserving critical slot information. All the scaffolds we propose can be applied to different neural network models. In this work we select Pointer-Generator as our base model in SPNet because we observe that Transformer only has a small improvement over Pointer-Generator but is having a higher cost on training time and computing resources. We observe that SPNet outperforms other methods in all the automatic evaluation metrics with a big margin, as it incorporates all the three semantic scaffolds.

132,"Is it expected to have speaker role, semantic slot and dialog domain annotations in real world datasets?","Not at the moment, but summaries can be additionaly extended with this annotations.","Moreover, we can easily extend SPNet to other summarization tasks.

133,How does new evaluation metric considers critical informative entities?,Answer with content missing: (formula for CIC) it accounts for the most important information within each dialog domain. CIC can be applied to any summarization task with predefined essential entities.,"In this case, the summary has a high ROUGE score, as it has a considerable proportion of word overlap with the reference summary. However, it still has poor relevance and readability, for leaving out one of the most critical information: [time]. ROUGE treats each word equally in computing n-gram overlap while the informativeness actually varies: common words or phrases (e.g. “You are going to"") significantly contribute to the ROUGE score and readability, but they are almost irrelevant to essential contents. The semantic slot values (e.g. [restaurant_name], [time]) are more essential compared to other words in the summary. However, ROUGE did not take this into consideration. To address this drawback in ROUGE, we propose a new evaluation metric: Critical Information Completeness (CIC). Formally, CIC is a recall of semantic slot information between a candidate summary and a reference summary. CIC is defined as follows:
where $V$ stands for a set of delexicalized values in the reference summary, $Count_{match}(v)$ is the number of values co-occurring in the candidate summary and reference summary, and $m$ is the number of values in set $V$. In our experiments, CIC is computed as the arithmetic mean over all the dialog domains to retain the overall performance.
CIC is a suitable complementary metric to ROUGE because it accounts for the most important information within each dialog domain. CIC can be applied to any summarization task with predefined essential entities. For example, in news summarization the proper nouns are the critical information to retain.","It considers semantic slot values (e.g. [restaurant_name], [time]).",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.493369524819332,16.67841962025862,14.09447002234768,0.0753012048192771,0.0027510316368638,0.2578542828559875,0.4142835363745689,0.2584198005497455,0.6013245582580566

Topic modeling has a wide range of applications in health and medical domains such as predicting protein-protein relationships based on the literature knowledge BIBREF46 , discovering relevant clinical concepts and structures in patients' health records BIBREF47 , and identifying patterns of clinical events in a cohort of brain cancer patients BIBREF48 .

So the overall train-validation-test ratio is 70%-20%-10%. We report the mean metrics from the CV in Table TABREF14 .

Acc. is a substantial improvement over HTDN despite the fact that the latter use both text and image data.

144,What is the performance difference between proposed method and state-of-the-arts on these datasets?,Difference is around 1 BLEU score lower on average than state of the art methods.,"Table TABREF40 illustrates the BLEU scores of FlowSeq and baselines with advanced decoding methods such as iterative refinement, IWD and NPD rescoring. The first block in Table TABREF40 includes the baseline results from autoregressive Transformer. For the sampling procedure in IWD and NPD, we sampled from a reduced-temperature model BIBREF11 to obtain high-quality samples. We vary the temperature within $\lbrace 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0\rbrace $ and select the best temperature based on the performance on development sets. The analysis of the impact of sampling temperature and other hyper-parameters on samples is in § SECREF50. For FlowSeq, NPD obtains better results than IWD, showing that FlowSeq still falls behind auto-regressive Transformer on model data distributions. Comparing with CMLM BIBREF8 with 10 iterations of refinement, which is a contemporaneous work that achieves state-of-the-art translation performance, FlowSeq obtains competitive performance on both WMT2014 and WMT2016 corpora, with only slight degradation in translation quality. Leveraging iterative refinement to further improve the performance of FlowSeq has been left to future work.

146,What was the weakness in Hassan et al's evaluation design?,"MT developers to which crowd workers were compared are usually not professional translators, evaluation of sentences in isolation prevents raters from detecting translation errors, used not originally written Chinese test set.","The human evaluation of MT output in research scenarios is typically conducted by crowd workers in order to minimise costs. BIBREF13 shows that aggregated assessments of bilingual crowd workers are very similar to those of MT developers, and BIBREF14, based on experiments with data from WMT 2012, similarly conclude that with proper quality control, MT systems can be evaluated by crowd workers. BIBREF3 also use bilingual crowd workers, but the studies supporting the use of crowdsourcing for MT evaluation were performed with older MT systems, and their findings may not carry over to the evaluation of contemporary higher-quality neural machine translation (NMT) systems. In addition, the MT developers to which crowd workers were compared are usually not professional translators. We hypothesise that expert translators will provide more nuanced ratings than non-experts, and that their ratings will show a higher difference between MT outputs and human translations.
MT has been evaluated almost exclusively at the sentence level, owing to the fact that most MT systems do not yet take context across sentence boundaries into account. However, when machine translations are compared to those of professional translators, the omission of linguistic context—e. g., by random ordering of the sentences to be evaluated—does not do justice to humans who, in contrast to most MT systems, can and do take inter-sentential context into account BIBREF15, BIBREF16. We hypothesise that an evaluation of sentences in isolation, as applied by BIBREF3, precludes raters from detecting translation errors that become apparent only when inter-sentential context is available, and that they will judge MT quality less favourably when evaluating full documents.
The human reference translations with which machine translations are compared within the scope of a human–machine parity assessment play an important role. BIBREF3 used all source texts of the WMT 2017 Chinese–English test set for their experiments, of which only half were originally written in Chinese; the other half were translated from English into Chinese. Since translated texts are usually simpler than their original counterparts BIBREF17, they should be easier to translate for MT systems. Moreover, different human translations of the same source text sometimes show considerable differences in quality, and a comparison with an MT system only makes sense if the human reference translations are of high quality. BIBREF3, for example, had the WMT source texts re-translated as they were not convinced of the quality of the human translations in the test set. At WMT 2018, the organisers themselves noted that the manual evaluation included several reports of ill-formed reference translations BIBREF5. We hypothesise that the quality of the human translations has a significant effect on findings of human–machine parity, which would indicate that it is necessary to ensure that human translations used to assess parity claims need to be carefully vetted for their quality.",Using non-expert MT developers for comparison.,0.1111111083333334,0.0571428546938776,0.1111111083333334,2.4092489848483223,27.24315998570781,24.55634633188563,0.1008386581469648,0.0019960079840319,0.5224575400352478,0.8441860070779695,0.5224575996398926,0.4635374844074249
147,What evidence do they present that the model attends to shallow context clues?,Using model gradients with respect to input features they presented that the most important model inputs are verbs associated with entities which shows that the model attends to shallow context clues.,"One way to analyze the model is to compute model gradients with respect to input features BIBREF26, BIBREF25. Figure FIGREF37 shows that in this particular example, the most important model inputs are verbs possibly associated with the entity butter, in addition to the entity's mentions themselves. It further shows that the model learns to extract shallow clues of identifying actions exerted upon only the entity being tracked, regardless of other entities, by leveraging verb semantics.",Figure FIGREF37.,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1599713834969505,3.294706470742707,3.8929087860726255,0.0171821305841924,0.0006447453255963,0.0824135243892669,0.2576878274359355,0.0824135094881057,0.3243347108364105
148,In what way is the input restructured?,"In four entity-centric ways - entity-first, entity-last, document-level and sentence-level.","Our approach consists of structuring input to the transformer network to use and guide the self-attention of the transformers, conditioning it on the entity. Our main mode of encoding the input, the entity-first method, is shown in Figure FIGREF4. The input sequence begins with a [START] token, then the entity under consideration, then a [SEP] token. After each sentence, a [CLS] token is used to anchor the prediction for that sentence. In this model, the transformer can always observe the entity it should be primarily “attending to” from the standpoint of building representations. We also have an entity-last variant where the entity is primarily observed just before the classification token to condition the [CLS] token's self-attention accordingly. These variants are naturally more computationally-intensive than post-conditioned models, as we need to rerun the transformer for each distinct entity we want to make a prediction for.
As an additional variation, we can either run the transformer once per document with multiple [CLS] tokens (a document-level model as shown in Figure FIGREF4) or specialize the prediction to a single timestep (a sentence-level model). In a sentence level model, we formulate each pair of entity $e$ and process step $t$ as a separate instance for our classification task. Thus, for a process with $T$ steps and $m$ entities we get $T \times m$ input sequences for fine tuning our classification task.","The input is restructured to include a [START] token, entity, [SEP] token, and [CLS] tokens after each sentence.",0.0740740694101512,0.0,0.0740740694101512,1.377944310261329,21.72513801689484,18.57654963180308,0.1379310344827586,0.0104772991850989,0.5298068523406982,0.2627495046584838,0.529806911945343,0.1272644251585006

151,What are simulated datasets collected?,There are 6 simulated datasets collected which is initialised with a corpus of size 550 and simulated by generating new documents from Wikipedia extracts and replacing existing documents.,"The generation process of the simulated data sets is designed to mimic the real world. Users open some existing documents in a file system, make some changes (e.g. addition, deletion or replacement), and save them as separate documents. These documents become revisions of the original documents. We started from an initial corpus that did not have revisions, and kept adding new documents and revising existing documents. Similar to a file system, at any moment new documents could be added and/or some of the current documents could be revised. The revision operations we used were deletion, addition and replacement of words, sentences, paragraphs, section names and document titles. The addition of words, ..., section names, and new documents were pulled from the Wikipedia abstracts. This corpus generation process had five time periods INLINEFORM0 . Figure FIGREF42 illustrates this simulation. We set a Poisson distribution with rate INLINEFORM1 (the number of documents in the initial corpus) to control the number of new documents added in each time period, and a Poisson distribution with rate INLINEFORM2 to control the number of documents revised in each time period.
We generated six data sets using different random seeds, and each data set contained six corpora (Corpus 0 - 5). Table TABREF48 summarizes the first data set. In each data set, we name the initial corpus Corpus 0, and define INLINEFORM0 as the timestamp when we started this simulation process. We set INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 . Corpus INLINEFORM3 corresponds to documents generated before timestamp INLINEFORM4 . We extracted document revisions from Corpus INLINEFORM5 and compared the revisions generated in (Corpus INLINEFORM6 - Corpus INLINEFORM7 ) with the ground truths in Table TABREF48 . Hence, we ran four experiments on this data set in total. In every experiment, INLINEFORM8 is calibrated based on Corpus INLINEFORM9 . For instance, the training set of the first experiment was Corpus 1. We trained INLINEFORM10 from Corpus 1. We extracted all revisions in Corpus 2, and compared revisions generated in the test set (Corpus 2 - Corpus 1) with the ground truth: 258 revised documents.

In other words, if the model sees a space, it will attend on all previous step. If the model sees a letter, it will attend no further then the last space step.

159,Why did they think this was a good idea?,They think it will help human TCM practitioners make prescriptions.,"During the long history of TCM, there has been a number of therapy records or treatment guidelines in the TCM classics composed by outstanding TCM researchers and practitioners. In real life, TCM practitioners often take these classical records for reference when prescribing for the patient, which inspires us to design a model that can automatically generate prescriptions by learning from these classics. It also needs to be noted that due to the issues in actual practice, the objective of this work is to generate candidate prescriptions to facilitate the prescribing procedure instead of substituting the human practitioners completely. An example of TCM prescription is shown in Table 1 . The herbs in the prescription are organized in a weak order. By “weak order”, we mean that the effect of the herbs are not influenced by the order. However, the order of the herbs reflects the way of thinking when constructing the prescription.

160,What QA models were used?,"A pointer network decodes the answer from a bidirectional LSTM with attention flow layer and self-matching layer, whose inputs come from word and character embeddings of the query and input text fed through a highway layer.","The input of our model are the words in the input text $x[1], ... , x[n]$ and query $q[1], ... , q[n]$ . We concatenate pre-trained word embeddings from GloVe BIBREF40 and character embeddings trained by CharCNN BIBREF41 to represent input words. The $2d$ -dimension embedding vectors of input text $x_1, ... , x_n$ and query $q_1, ... , q_n$ are then fed into a Highway Layer BIBREF42 to improve the capability of word embeddings and character embeddings as
$$\begin{split} g_t &= {\rm sigmoid}(W_gx_t+b_g) \\ s_t &= {\rm relu } (W_xx_t+b_x) \\ u_t &= g_t \odot s_t + (1 - g_t) \odot x_t~. \end{split}$$ (Eq. 18)
Here $W_g, W_x \in \mathbb {R}^{d \times 2d}$ and $b_g, b_x \in \mathbb {R}^d$ are trainable weights, $u_t$ is a $d$ -dimension vector. The function relu is the rectified linear units BIBREF43 and $\odot $ is element-wise multiply over two vectors. The same Highway Layer is applied to $q_t$ and produces $v_t$ .
Next, $u_t$ and $v_t$ are fed into a Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory Network (BiLSTM) BIBREF44 respectively in order to model the temporal interactions between sequence words:
Here we obtain $\mathbf {U} = [u_1^{^{\prime }}, ... , u_n^{^{\prime }}] \in \mathbb {R}^{2d \times n}$ and $\mathbf {V} = [v_1^{^{\prime }}, ... , v_m^{^{\prime }}] \in \mathbb {R}^{2d \times m}$ . Then we feed $\mathbf {U}$ and $\mathbf {V}$ into the attention flow layer BIBREF27 to model the interactions between the input text and query. We obtain the $8d$ -dimension query-aware context embedding vectors $h_1, ... , h_n$ as the result.
After modeling interactions between the input text and queries, we need to enhance the interactions within the input text words themselves especially for the longer text in IE settings. Therefore, we introduce Self-Matching Layer BIBREF29 in our model as
$$\begin{split} o_t &= {\rm BiLSTM}(o_{t-1}, [h_t, c_t]) \\ s_j^t &= w^T {\rm tanh}(W_hh_j+\tilde{W_h}h_t)\\ \alpha _i^t &= {\rm exp}(s_i^t)/\Sigma _{j=1}^n{\rm exp}(s_j^t)\\ c_t &= \Sigma _{i=1}^n\alpha _i^th_i ~. \end{split}$$ (Eq. 20)
Here $W_h, \tilde{W_h} \in \mathbb {R}^{d \times 8d}$ and $w \in \mathbb {R}^d$ are trainable weights, $[h, c]$ is vector concatenation across row. Besides, $\alpha _i^t$ is the attention weight from the $t^{th}$ word to the $i^{th}$ word and $c_t$ is the enhanced contextual embeddings over the $t^{th}$ word in the input text. We obtain the $2d$ -dimension query-aware and self-enhanced embeddings of input text after this step. Finally we feed the embeddings $\mathbf {O} = [o_1, ... , o_n]$ into a Pointer Network BIBREF39 to decode the answer sequence as
$$\begin{split} p_t &= {\rm LSTM}(p_{t-1}, c_t) \\ s_j^t &= w^T {\rm tanh}(W_oo_j+W_pp_{t-1})\\ \beta _i^t &= {\rm exp}(s_i^t)/\Sigma _{j=1}^n{\rm exp}(s_j^t)\\ c_t &= \Sigma _{i=1}^n\beta _i^to_i~. \end{split}$$ (Eq. 21)
Here $\beta _{n+1}^t$ denotes the probability of generating the “ ${\rm eos}$ ” symbol since the decoder also needs to determine when to stop. Therefore, the probability of generating the answer sequence $\textbf {a}$ is as follows
$${\rm P}(\textbf {a}|\mathbf {O}) = \prod _t {\rm P}(a^t | a^1, ... , a^{t-1}, \mathbf {O})~.$$ (Eq. 23)","BiLSTM, Pointer Network, Highway Layer, and Self-Matching Layer.",0.0526315756232689,0.0,0.0526315756232689,1.2753998269755913,29.99562209057889,24.678714960183584,0.2165725047080979,0.0024937655860349,0.5021899342536926,0.8668280871670702,0.5021899342536926,0.8046595454216003

This may be due to the text style or level of complexities of both datasets. So, we concentrated to develop a robust system for English code-mixed texts, and uni-lingual texts, which can also handle different writing styles. Our approach is based on three main ideas:",Text style and level of complexities.,0.1176470542560555,0.0,0.1176470542560555,4.02724819242185,19.117084311324977,17.463249197388812,0.1304347826086956,0.0054249547920434,0.3242940902709961,0.5808779514498181,0.3242940902709961,0.5658629536628723
167,How much improvement is gained from the proposed approaches?,It eliminates non-termination in some models fixing for some models up to 6% of non-termination ratio.,"Table TABREF44 shows that consistent nucleus and top-$k$ sampling (§SECREF28) resulted in only terminating sequences, except for a few cases that we attribute to the finite limit $L$ used to measure the non-termination ratio. The example continuations in Table TABREF46 show that the sampling tends to preserve language modeling quality on prefixes that led to termination with the baseline (first row). On prefixes that led to non-termination with the baseline (second & third rows), the quality tends to improve since the continuation now terminates. Since the model's non-$\left<\text{eos}\right>$ token probabilities at each step are only modified by a multiplicative constant, the sampling process can still enter a repetitive cycle (e.g. when the constant is close to 1), though the cycle is guaranteed to eventually terminate.
For the example decoded sequences in Table TABREF46, generation quality is similar when both the self-terminating and baseline models terminate (first row). For prefixes that led to non-termination with the baseline, the self-terminating variant can yield a finite sequence with reasonable quality (second row). This suggests that some cases of degenerate repetition BIBREF5, BIBREF10 may be attributed to inconsistency. However, in other cases the self-terminating model enters a repetitive (but finite) cycle that resembles the baseline (third row), showing that consistency does not necessarily eliminate degenerate repetition.

168,Is infinite-length sequence generation a result of training with maximum likelihood?,There are is a strong conjecture that it might be the reason but it is not proven.,"We extended the notion of consistency of a recurrent language model put forward by BIBREF16 to incorporate a decoding algorithm, and used it to analyze the discrepancy between a model and the distribution induced by a decoding algorithm. We proved that incomplete decoding is inconsistent, and proposed two methods to prevent this: consistent decoding and the self-terminating recurrent language model. Using a sequence completion task, we confirmed that empirical inconsistency occurs in practice, and that each method prevents inconsistency while maintaining the quality of generated sequences. We suspect the absence of decoding in maximum likelihood estimation as a cause behind this inconsistency, and suggest investigating sequence-level learning as an alternative in the future.
Inconsistency may arise from the lack of decoding in solving this optimization problem. Maximum likelihood learning fits the model $p_{\theta }$ using the data distribution, whereas a decoded sequence from the trained model follows the distribution $q_{\mathcal {F}}$ induced by a decoding algorithm. Based on this discrepancy, we make a strong conjecture: we cannot be guaranteed to obtain a good consistent sequence generator using maximum likelihood learning and greedy decoding.

To produce a language-agnostic syllabifier, it is crucial to test syllabification accuracy across different language families and language groupings within families. We selected six evaluation languages: English, Dutch, Italian, French, Basque, and Manipuri. These represent two language families (Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan), a language isolate thought to be unrelated to any existing language (Basque), and two different subfamilies within the Indo-European family (West Germanic, Romance). The primary constraint was the availability of syllabified datasets for training and testing. Table TABREF17 presents details of each dataset.
Among the six languages we evaluate with, both English and Dutch are notable for the availability of rich datasets of phonetic and syllabic transcriptions. These are found in the CELEX (Dutch Centre for Lexical Information) database BIBREF16. CELEX was built jointly by the University of Nijmegen, the Institute for Dutch Lexicology in Leiden, the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, and the Institute for Perception Research in Eindhoven. CELEX is maintained by the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. The CELEX database contains information on orthography, phonology, morphology, syntax and word frequency. It also contains syllabified words in Dutch and English transcribed using SAM-PA, CELEX, CPA, and DISC notations. The first three are variations of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), in that each uses a standard ASCII character to represent each IPA character. DISC is different than the other three in that it maps a distinct ASCII character to each phone in the sound systems of Dutch, English, and German BIBREF38. Different phonetic transcriptions are used in different datasets. Part of the strength of our proposed syllabifier is that every transcription can be used as-is without any additional modification to the syllabifier or the input sequences. The other datasets were hand-syllabified by linguists with the exception of the IIT-Guwahat dataset and the Festival dataset.

The model we call Base is the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model described in Section SECREF2 with the associated hyperparameters. Another model, Small, uses the same architecture as Base but reduces the number of convolutional layers to 1, the convolutional filters to 40, the LSTM dimension $l$ to 50, and the phone embedding size $d$ to 100. We also tested a Base-Softmax model, which replaces the CRF output of the Base model with a softmax. A comparison of the results of these three models can be seen in Table TABREF25. This comparison empirically motivates the CRF output because Base almost always outperforms Base-Softmax. Of these three models, the Base model performed the best with the exception of the French and Manipuri datasets. The differences in the French results can be considered negligible because the accuracies are all near $100\%$. The Small model performed best on Manipuri, which may suggest that reducing the number of parameters of the Base model leads to better accuracy on smaller datasets.

180,What are the linguistic differences between each class?,"Each class has different patterns in adjectives, adverbs and verbs for sarcastic and non-sarcastic classes.","Generic Sarcasm. We first examine the different patterns learned on the Gen dataset. Table TABREF29 show examples of extracted patterns for each class. We observe that the not-sarcastic patterns appear to capture technical and scientific language, while the sarcastic patterns tend to capture subjective language that is not topic-specific. We observe an abundance of adjective and adverb patterns for the sarcastic class, although we do not use adjective and adverb patterns in our regex retrieval method. Instead, such cues co-occur with the cues we search for, expanding our pattern inventory as we show in Table TABREF31 .
Rhetorical Questions. We notice that while the not-sarcastic patterns generated for RQs are similar to the topic-specific not-sarcastic patterns we find in the general dataset, there are some interesting features of the sarcastic patterns that are more unique to the RQs.
Many of our sarcastic questions focus specifically on attacks on the mental abilities of the addressee. This generalization is made clear when we extract and analyze the verb, subject, and object arguments using the Stanford dependency parser BIBREF32 for the questions in the RQ dataset. Table TABREF32 shows a few examples of the relations we extract.
Hyperbole. One common pattern for hyperbole involves adverbs and adjectives, as noted above. We did not use this pattern to retrieve hyperbole, but because each hyperbolic sarcastic utterance contains multiple cues, we learn an expanded class of patterns for hyperbole. Table TABREF33 illustrates some of the new adverb adjective patterns that are frequent, high-precision indicators of sarcasm.
We learn a number of verbal patterns that we had not previously associated with hyperbole, as shown in Table TABREF34 . Interestingly, many of these instantiate the observations of CanoMora2009 on hyperbole and its related semantic fields: creating contrast by exclusion, e.g. no limit and no way, or by expanding a predicated class, e.g. everyone knows. Many of them are also contrastive. Table TABREF33 shows just a few examples, such as though it in no way and so much knowledge.","- Not-sarcastic: technical and scientific language, topic-specific.

T imefull is the time spent on training the whole model, T imeDP is the time spent on training the dialogue policy maker.
BPRA Results: As shown in Table TABREF35, most of the models have similar performance on BPRA on these two datasets, which can guarantee a consistent impact on the dialogue policy maker. All the models perform very well in BPRA on DSTC2 dataset. On Maluuba dataset, the BPRA decreases because of the complex domains. We can notice that BPRA of CDM is slightly worse than other models on Maluuba dataset, the reason is that the CDM's dialogue policy maker contains lots of classifications and has the bigger loss than other models because of complex domains, which affects the training of the dialogue belief tracker.
APRA Results: Compared with baselines, GDP achieves the best performance in APRA on two datasets. It can be noted that we do not compare with the E2ECM baseline in APRA. E2ECM only uses a simple classifier to recognize the label of the acts and ignores the parameters information. In our experiment, APRA of E2ECM is slightly better than our method. Considering the lack of parameters of the acts, it's unfair for our GDP method. Furthermore, the CDM baseline considers the parameters of the act. But GDP is far better than CDM in supervised learning and reinforcement learning.
BLEU Results: GDP significantly outperforms the baselines on BLEU. As mentioned above, E2ECM is actually slightly better than GDP in APRA. But in fact, we can find that the language quality of the response generated by GDP is still better than E2ECM, which proves that lack of enough parameters information makes it difficult to find the appropriate sentence template in NLG. It can be found that the BLEU of all models is very poor on Maluuba dataset. The reason is that Maluuba is a human-human task-oriented dialogue dataset, the utterances are very flexible, the natural language generator for all methods is difficult to generate an accurate utterance based on the context. And DSTC2 is a human-machine dialog dataset. The response is very regular so the effectiveness of NLG will be better than that of Maluuba.

In other words, the network should depend on the semantic similarity between slots and utterance instead of slot-specific modules. To this end, we propose the Slot-Independent Model (SIM). Our model complexity does not increase when the number of slots in dialogue tasks go up. Thus, SIM has many fewer parameters than existing dialogue state tracking models. To compensate for the exclusion of slot-specific parameters, we incorporate better feature representation of user utterance and dialogue states using syntactic information and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The refined representation, in addition to cross and self-attention mechanisms, make our model achieve even better performance than slot-specific models.

FS-MTL shows the minimum performance gain from multi-task learning since it puts all private and shared information into a unified space. SSP-MTL and PSP-MTL achieve similar performance and are outperformed by ASP-MTL which can better separate the task-specific and task-invariant features by using adversarial training.

While it is true that they show a linear correlation, INLINEFORM2 may produce a different system ranking than INLINEFORM3 given the integral multi-reference principle it follows. However, what we consider the most profitable about INLINEFORM4 is the twofold inclusion of all available references it performs. First, the construction of INLINEFORM5 to provide a more inclusive reference against to whom be evaluated and then, the computation of INLINEFORM6 , which scales the result depending of the agreement between references.
In this paper we presented WiSeBE, a semi-automatic multi-reference sentence boundary evaluation protocol based on the necessity of having a more reliable way for evaluating the SBD task. We showed how INLINEFORM0 is an inclusive metric which not only evaluates the performance of a system against all references, but also takes into account the agreement between them. According to your point of view, this inclusivity is very important given the difficulties that are present when working with spoken language and the possible disagreements that a task like SBD could provoke.","The twofold inclusion of all available references and the computation of INLINEFORM6, which scales the result depending on the agreement between references.",0.2222222177777778,0.1379310304875149,0.2222222177777778,4.13899678497139,22.07046262938101,20.14960330794004,0.3289473684210526,0.0108803165182987,0.2257353365421295,0.5412419401109219,0.2257353216409683,0.4986531734466553

examples remain comparable (e.g. the overall accuracy of BERT on modified examples raises from 24.1% to 66.0% on Quora)","Adversarial training can often improve model robustness BIBREF25, BIBREF27. We also fine-tune the target models using adversarial training. At each training step, we train the model with a batch of original examples along with adversarial examples with balanced labels. The adversarial examples account for around 10% in a batch. During training, we generate adversarial examples with the current model as the target and update the model parameters with the hybrid batch iteratively. The beam size for generation is set to 1 to reduce the computation cost, since the generation success rate is minor in adversarial training. We evaluate the adversarially trained models, as shown in Table TABREF18.
After adversarial training, the performance of all the target models raises significantly, while that on the original examples remain comparable. Note that since the focus of this paper is on model robustness which can hardly be reflected in original data, we do not expect performance improvement on original data. The results demonstrate that adversarial training with our adversarial examples can significantly improve the robustness we focus on without remarkably hurting the performance on original data.

207,Why is big data not appropriate for this task?,Training embeddings from small-corpora can increase the performance of some tasks.,"Word embeddings have risen in popularity for NLP applications due to the success of models designed specifically for the big data setting. In particular, BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 showed that very simple word embedding models with high-dimensional representations can scale up to massive datasets, allowing them to outperform more sophisticated neural network language models which can process fewer documents. In this work, I offer a somewhat contrarian perspective to the currently prevailing trend of big data optimism, as exemplified by the work of BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF3 , and others, who argue that massive datasets are sufficient to allow language models to automatically resolve many challenging NLP tasks. Note that “big” datasets are not always available, particularly in computational social science NLP applications, where the data of interest are often not obtained from large scale sources such as the internet and social media, but from sources such as press releases BIBREF11 , academic journals BIBREF10 , books BIBREF12 , and transcripts of recorded speech BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 . A standard practice in the literature is to train word embedding models on a generic large corpus such as Wikipedia, and use the embeddings for NLP tasks on the target dataset, cf. BIBREF3 , BIBREF0 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 . However, as we shall see here, this standard practice might not always be effective, as the size of a dataset does not correspond to its degree of relevance for a particular analysis. Even very large corpora have idiosyncrasies that can make their embeddings invalid for other domains. For instance, suppose we would like to use word embeddings to analyze scientific articles on machine learning. In Table TABREF1 , I report the most similar words to the word “learning” based on word embedding models trained on two corpora. For embeddings trained on articles from the NIPS conference, the most similar words are related to machine learning, as desired, while for embeddings trained on the massive, generic Google News corpus, the most similar words relate to learning and teaching in the classroom. Evidently, domain-specific data can be important.
I have proposed a model-based method for training interpretable corpus-specific word embeddings for computational social science, using mixed membership representations, Metropolis-Hastings-Walker sampling, and NCE. Experimental results for prediction, supervised learning, and case studies on state of the Union addresses and NIPS articles, indicate that high-quality embeddings and topics can be obtained using the method. The results highlight the fact that big data is not always best, as domain-specific data can be very valuable, even when it is small. I plan to use this approach for substantive social science applications, and to address algorithmic bias and fairness issues.","Big data is not always relevant to the task at hand, and domain-specific data can be more valuable.",0.1428571380867348,0.0,0.0714285666581635,2.2882399068641384,17.836428107127226,15.451989711871049,0.15625,0.0104772991850989,0.2468069493770599,0.4114633986243494,0.2468069791793823,0.551580548286438

210,Which modifications do they make to well-established Seq2seq architectures?,"Replacing attention mechanism to query-key attention, and adding a loss to make the attention mask as diagonal as possible.","Traditional text-to-speech (TTS) systems are composed of complex pipelines BIBREF0 , these often include accoustic frontends, duration model, acoustic prediction model and vocoder models. The complexity of the TTS problem coupled with the requirement for deep domain expertise means these systems are often brittle in design and results in un-natural synthesized speech.
Neural text-to-speech systems have garnered large research interest in the past 2 years. The first to fully explore this avenue of research was Google's tacotron BIBREF1 system. Their architecture based off the original Seq2Seq framework. In addition to encoder/decoder RNNs from the original Seq2Seq , they also included a bottleneck prenet module termed CBHG, which is composed of sets of 1-D convolution networks followed by highway residual layers. The attention mechanism follows the original Seq2Seq BIBREF7 mechanism (often termed Bahdanau attention). This is the first work to propose training a Seq2Seq model to convert text to mel spectrogram, which can then be converted to audio wav via iterative algorithms such as Griffin Lim BIBREF8 .
The architecture of our model utilizes RNN-based Seq2Seq model for generating mel spectrogram from text. The architecture is similar to that of Tacotron 2 BIBREF4 . The generated mel spetrogram can either be inverted via iterative algorithms such as Griffin Lim, or through more complicated neural vocoder networks such as a mel spectrogram conditioned Wavenet BIBREF11 .
In the original Tacotron 2, the attention mechanism used was location sensitive attention BIBREF12 combined the original additive Seq2Seq BIBREF7 Bahdanau attention.
We propose to replace this attention with the simpler query-key attention from transformer model. As mentioned earlier, since for TTS the attention mechanism is an easier problem than say machine translation, we employ query-key attention as it's simple to implement and requires less parameters than the original Bahdanau attention.
Following the logic above, we utilize a similar method from BIBREF6 that adds an additional guided attention loss to the overall loss objective, which acts to help the attention mechanism become monotoic as early as possible.
As seen from FIGREF24 , an attention loss mask, INLINEFORM0 , is created applies a loss to force the attention alignment, INLINEFORM1 , to be nearly diagonal. That is: DISPLAYFORM0",They replace location sensitive attention with query-key attention and add guided attention loss.,0.2962962914677641,0.0,0.2962962914677641,4.968018039415939,48.57594419460883,43.02001162105381,0.2620843596059113,0.0071704357418643,0.6005736589431763,0.6559374264980617,0.6005735993385315,0.686877965927124

213,Which sentiment analysis tasks are addressed?,12 binary-class classification and multi-class classification of reviews based on rating.,"We conducted experiments on the Amazon reviews dataset BIBREF9, which is a benchmark dataset in the cross-domain sentiment analysis field. This dataset contains Amazon product reviews of four different product domains: Books (B), DVD (D), Electronics (E), and Kitchen (K) appliances. Each review is originally associated with a rating of 1-5 stars and is encoded in 5,000 dimensional feature vectors of bag-of-words unigrams and bigrams.
Experiment ::: Dataset and Task Design ::: Binary-Class.
From this dataset, we constructed 12 binary-class cross-domain sentiment analysis tasks: B$\rightarrow $D, B$\rightarrow $E, B$\rightarrow $K, D$\rightarrow $B, D$\rightarrow $E, D$\rightarrow $K, E$\rightarrow $B, E$\rightarrow $D, E$\rightarrow $K, K$\rightarrow $B, K$\rightarrow $D, K$\rightarrow $E. Following the setting of previous works, we treated a reviews as class `1' if it was ranked up to 3 stars, and as class `2' if it was ranked 4 or 5 stars. For each task, $\mathcal {D}_S$ consisted of 1,000 examples of each class, and $\mathcal {D}_T$ consists of 1500 examples of class `1' and 500 examples of class `2'. In addition, since it is reasonable to assume that $\mathcal {D}_T$ can reveal the distribution of target domain data, we controlled the target domain testing dataset to have the same class ratio as $\mathcal {D}_T$. Using the same label assigning mechanism, we also studied model performance over different degrees of $\rm {P}(\rm {Y})$ shift, which was evaluated by the max value of $\rm {P}_S(\rm {Y}=i)/\rm {P}_T(\rm {Y}=i), \forall i=1, \cdots , L$. Please refer to Appendix C for more detail about the task design for this study.
Experiment ::: Dataset and Task Design ::: Multi-Class.
We additionally constructed 12 multi-class cross-domain sentiment classification tasks. Tasks were designed to distinguish reviews of 1 or 2 stars (class 1) from those of 4 stars (class 2) and those of 5 stars (class 3). For each task, $\mathcal {D}_S$ contained 1000 examples of each class, and $\mathcal {D}_T$ consisted of 500 examples of class 1, 1500 examples of class 2, and 1000 examples of class 3.

220,How did they get relations between mentions?,"Assign a value to the relation based on whether mentions occur in the same document, if mentions are identical, or if mentions are in the same coreference chain.","To each node $v_i$ , we associate a continuous annotation $\mathbf {x}_i \in \mathbb {R}^D$ which represents an entity in the context where it was mentioned (details in Section ""Node annotations"" ). We then proceed to connect these mentions i) if they co-occur within the same document (we will refer to this as DOC-BASED edges), ii) if the pair of named entity mentions is identical (MATCH edges—these may connect nodes across and within documents), or iii) if they are in the same coreference chain, as predicted by the external coreference system (COREF edges). Note that MATCH edges when connecting mentions in the same document are mostly included in the set of edges predicted by the coreference system. Having the two types of edges lets us distinguish between less reliable edges provided by the coreference system and more reliable (but also more sparse) edges given by the exact-match heuristic. We treat these three types of connections as three different types of relations. See Figure 2 for an illustration. In addition to that, and to prevent having disconnected graphs, we add a fourth type of relation (COMPLEMENT edge) between any two nodes that are not connected with any of the other relations. We can think of these edges as those in the complement set of the entity graph with respect to a fully connected graph.","They connected mentions based on co-occurrence, exact-match, coreference, and complement edges.",0.1935483825182102,0.0606060563820021,0.1290322534859523,3.2808945250121395,32.67991239163117,30.112584100656832,0.1631264750798278,0.0042129452317119,0.6216415166854858,0.6004473254579792,0.6216415762901306,0.5082213282585144

For a given query $q = \langle s, r, ? \rangle $ , we identify mentions in $S_q$ of the entities in $C_q \cup \lbrace s\rbrace $ and create one node per mention. This process is based on the following heuristic:
we consider mentions spans in $S_q$ exactly matching an element of $C_q \cup \lbrace s\rbrace $ . Admittedly, this is a rather simple strategy which may suffer from low recall.
we use predictions from a coreference resolution system to add mentions of elements in $C_q \cup \lbrace s\rbrace $ beyond exact matching (including both noun phrases and anaphoric pronouns). In particular, we use the end-to-end coreference resolution by BIBREF16 .

230,How are their changes evaluated?,The changes are evaluated based on accuracy of intent and entity recognition on SNIPS dataset.,"To evaluate the performance of our approach, we used a subset of the SNIPS BIBREF12 dataset, which is readily available in RASA nlu format. Our training data consisted of 700 utterances, across 7 different intents (AddToPlaylist, BookRestaurant, GetWeather, PlayMusic, RateBook, SearchCreativeWork, and SearchScreeningEvent). In order to test our implementation of incremental components, we initially benchmarked their non-incremental counterparts, and used that as a baseline for the incremental versions (to treat the sium component as non-incremental, we simply applied all words in each utterance to it and obtained the distribution over intents after each full utterance had been processed).
We use accuracy of intent and entity recognition as our task and metric. To evaluate the components worked as intended, we then used the IncrementalInterpreter to parse the messages as individual ius. To ensure REVOKE worked as intended, we injected random incorrect words at a rate of 40%, followed by subsequent revokes, ensuring that an ADD followed by a revoke resulted in the same output as if the incorrect word had never been added. While we implemented both an update-incremental and a restart-incremental RASA nlu component, the results of the two cannot be directly compared for accuracy as the underlying models differ greatly (i.e., sium is generative, whereas Tensorflow Embedding is a discriminative neural network; moreover, sium was designed to work as a reference resolution component to physical objects, not abstract intents), nor are these results conducive to an argument of update- vs. restart-incremental approaches, as the underlying architecture of the models vary greatly.",Through accuracy of intent and entity recognition.,0.571428566984127,0.4999999958,0.571428566984127,31.314224813827344,72.02411147250996,70.43187327896251,0.45515574650913,0.0069513406156901,0.643532395362854,0.875,0.6435322761535645,0.7688804268836975

232,What is the size of the released dataset?,"440 sentences, 2247 triples extracted from those sentences, and 11262 judgements on those triples.","We used two different data sources in our evaluation. The first dataset (WIKI) was the same set of 200 sentences from Wikipedia used in BIBREF7 . These sentences were randomly selected by the creators of the dataset. This choice allows for a rough comparison between our results and theirs.
The second dataset (SCI) was a set of 220 sentences from the scientific literature. We sourced the sentences from the OA-STM corpus. This corpus is derived from the 10 most published in disciplines. It includes 11 articles each from the following domains: agriculture, astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, earth science, engineering, materials science, math, and medicine. The article text is made freely available and the corpus provides both an XML and a simple text version of each article.
We employed the following annotation process. Each OIE extractor was applied to both datasets with the settings described above. This resulted in the generation of triples for 199 of the 200 WIKI sentences and 206 of the 220 SCI sentences. That is there were some sentences in which no triples were extracted. We discuss later the sentences in which no triples were extracted. In total 2247 triples were extracted.
In total, 11262 judgements were obtained after running the annotation process. Every triple had at least 5 judgements from different annotators. All judgement data is made available. The proportion of overall agreement between annotators is 0.76 with a standard deviation of 0.25 on whether a triple is consequence of the given sentence. We also calculated inter-annotator agreement statistics. Using Krippendorff's alpha inter-annotator agreement was 0.44. This calculation was performed over all data and annotators as Krippendorff's alpha is designed to account for missing data and work across more than two annotators. Additionally, Fleiss' Kappa and Scott's pi were calculated pairwise between all annotators where there were overlapping ratings (i.e. raters had rated at least one triple in common). The average Fleiss's Kappa was 0.41 and the average of Scott's pi was 0.37. Using BIBREF14 as a guide, we interpret these statistics as suggesting there is moderate agreement between annotators and that agreement is above random chance. This moderate level of agreement is to be expected as the task itself can be difficult and requires judgement from the annotators at the margin.",4420 (2247 triples * 2 datasets).,0.1176470542560555,0.0,0.1176470542560555,5.061867434834413,30.989528193722897,28.644253169501106,0.0925925925925926,0.004594180704441,0.552718997001648,0.4344609112052593,0.5527189373970032,

236,Are this models usually semi/supervised or unsupervised?,"Both supervised and unsupervised, depending on the task that needs to be solved.","Machine translation finds use in cheminformatics in “translation"" from one language (e.g. reactants) to another (e.g. products). Machine translation is a challenging task because the syntactic and semantic dependencies of each language differ from one another and this may give rise to ambiguities. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models benefit from the potential of deep learning architectures to build a statistical model that aims to find the most probable target sequence for an input sequence by learning from a corpus of examples BIBREF110, BIBREF111. The main advantage of NMT models is that they provide an end-to-end system that utilizes a single neural network to convert the source sequence into the target sequence. BIBREF110 refer to their model as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) system that addresses a major limitation of DNNs that can only work with fixed-dimensionality information as input and output. However, in the machine translation task, the length of the input sequences is not fixed, and the length of the output sequences is not known in advance.
The variational Auto-encoder (VAE) is another widely adopted text generation architecture BIBREF101. BIBREF34 adopted this architecture for molecule generation. A traditional auto-encoder encodes the input into the latent space, which is then decoded to reconstruct the input. VAE differs from AE by explicitly defining a probability distribution on the latent space to generate new samples. BIBREF34 hypothesized that the variational part of the system integrates noise to the encoder, so that the decoder can be more robust to the large diversity of molecules. However, the authors also reported that the non-context free property of SMILES caused by matching ring numbers and parentheses might often lead the decoder to generate invalid SMILES strings. A grammar variational auto-encoder (GVAE), where the grammar for SMILES is explicitly defined instead of the auto-encoder learning the grammar itself, was proposed to address this issue BIBREF102. This way, the generation is based on the pre-defined grammar rules and the decoding process generates grammar production rules that should also be grammatically valid. Although syntactic validity would be ensured, the molecules may not have semantic validity (chemical validity). BIBREF103 built upon the VAE BIBREF34 and GVAE BIBREF102 architectures and introduced a syntax-directed variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) model for the molecular generation task. The syntax-direct generative mechanism in the decoder contributed to creating both syntactically and semantically valid SMILES sequences. BIBREF103 compared the latent representations of molecules generated by VAE, GVAE, and SD-VAE, and showed that SD-VAE provided better discriminative features for druglikeness. BIBREF104 proposed an adversarial AE for the same task. Conditional VAEs BIBREF105, BIBREF106 were trained to generate molecules conditioned on a desired property. The challenges that SMILES syntax presents inspired the introduction of new syntax such as DeepSMILES BIBREF29 and SELFIES BIBREF32 (details in Section SECREF3).
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models generate novel molecules by using two components: the generator network generates novel molecules, and the discriminator network aims to distinguish between the generated molecules and real molecules BIBREF107. In text generation models, the novel molecules are drawn from a distribution, which are then fine-tuned to obtain specific features, whereas adversarial learning utilizes generator and discriminator networks to produce novel molecules BIBREF107, BIBREF108.

As a first step towards solving this problem, we evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art models developed for other QA tasks, including a sentence-level prediction task and two segment retrieval tasks. In this section, we report their results on the TutorialVQA dataset.
Baselines ::: Baseline1: Sentence-level prediction
Given a transcript (a sequence of sentences) and a question, Baseline1 predicts (starting sentence index, ending sentence index). The model is based on RaSor BIBREF13, which has been developed for the SQuAD QA task BIBREF6. RaSor concatenates the embedding vectors of the starting and the ending words to represent a span. Following this idea, Baseline1 represents a span of sentences by concatenating the vectors of the starting and ending sentences. The left diagram in Fig. FIGREF15 illustrates the Baseline1 model.
Model. The model takes two inputs, a transcript, $\lbrace s_1, s_2, ... s_n\rbrace $ where $s_i$ are individual sentences and a question, $q$. The output is the span scores, $y$, the scores over all possible spans. GLoVe BIBREF14 is used for the word representations in the transcript and the questions. We use two bi-LSTMs BIBREF15 to encode the transcript.
where n is the number of sentences . The output of Passage-level Encoding, $p$, is a sequence of vector, $p_i$, which represents the latent meaning of each sentence. Then, the model combines each pair of sentence embeddings ($p_i$, $p_j$) to generate a span embedding.
where [$\cdot $,$\cdot $] indicates the concatenation. Finally, we use a one-layer feed forward network to compute a score between each span and a question.
In training, we use cross-entropy as an objective function. In testing, the span with the highest score is picked as an answer.
Baselines ::: Baseline2: Segment retrieval
We also considered a simpler task by casting our problem as a retrieval task. Specifically, in addition to a plain transcript, we also provided the model with the segmentation information which was created during the data collection phrase (See Section. SECREF3). Note that each segments corresponds to a candidate answer. Then, the task is to pick the best segment for given a query. This task is easier than Baseline1's task in that the segmentation information is provided to the model. Unlike Baseline1, however, it is unable to return an answer span at various granularities. Baseline2 is based on the attentive LSTM BIBREF17, which has been developed for the InsuranceQA task. The right diagram in Fig. FIGREF15 illustrates the Baseline2 model.
Model. The two inputs, $s$ and $q$ represent the segment text and a question. The model first encodes the two inputs.
$h^s$ is then re-weighted using attention weights.
where $\odot $ denotes the element-wise multiplication operation. The final score is computed using a one-layer feed-forward network.
During training, the model requires negative samples. For each positive example, (question, ground-truth segment), all the other segments in the same transcript are used as negative samples. Cross entropy is used as an objective function.
Baselines ::: Baseline3: Pipeline Segment retrieval
We construct a pipelined approach through another segment retrieval task, calculating the cosine similarities between the segment and question embeddings. In this task however, we want to test the accuracy of retrieving the segments given that we first retrieve the correct video from our 76 videos. First, we generate the TF-IDF embeddings for the whole video transcripts and questions. The next step involves retrieving the videos which have the lowest cosine distance between the video transcripts and question. We then filter and store the top ten videos, reducing the number of computations required in the next step. Finally, we calculate the cosine distances between the question and the segments which belong to the filtered top 10 videos, marking it as correct if found in these videos. While the task is less computationally expensive than the previous baseline, we do not learn the segment representations, as this task is a simple retrieval task based on TF-IDF embeddings.

243,What is the performance proposed model achieved on MathQA?,"Operation accuracy: 71.89
Execution accuracy: 55.95.","Given a natural-language math problem, we need to generate a sequence of operations (operators and corresponding arguments) from a set of operators and arguments to solve the given problem. Each operation is regarded as a relational tuple by viewing the operator as relation, e.g., $(add, n1, n2)$. We test TP-N2F for this task on the MathQA dataset BIBREF16. The MathQA dataset consists of about 37k math word problems, each with a corresponding list of multi-choice options and the corresponding operation sequence. In this task, TP-N2F is deployed to generate the operation sequence given the question. The generated operations are executed with the execution script from BIBREF16 to select a multi-choice answer. As there are about 30% noisy data (where the execution script returns the wrong answer when given the ground-truth program; see Sec. SECREF20 of the Appendix), we report both execution accuracy (of the final multi-choice answer after running the execution engine) and operation sequence accuracy (where the generated operation sequence must match the ground truth sequence exactly). TP-N2F is compared to a baseline provided by the seq2prog model in BIBREF16, an LSTM-based seq2seq model with attention. Our model outperforms both the original seq2prog, designated SEQ2PROG-orig, and the best reimplemented seq2prog after an extensive hyperparameter search, designated SEQ2PROG-best. Table TABREF16 presents the results. To verify the importance of the TP-N2F encoder and decoder, we conducted experiments to replace either the encoder with a standard LSTM (denoted LSTM2TP) or the decoder with a standard attentional LSTM (denoted TP2LSTM). We observe that both the TPR components of TP-N2F are important for achieving the observed performance gain relative to the baseline.

248,What is the main contribution of the paper? ,"Proposing an improved RNN model, the phonetic temporal neural LID approach, based on phonetic features that results in better performance.","All the present neural LID methods are based on acoustic features, e.g., Mel filter banks (Fbanks) or Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), with phonetic information largely overlooked. This may have significantly hindered the performance of neural LID. Intuitively, it is a long-standing hypothesis that languages can be discriminated between by phonetic properties, either distributional or temporal; additionally, phonetic features represent information at a higher level than acoustic features, and so are more invariant with respect to noise and channels. Pragmatically, it has been demonstrated that phonetic information, either in the form of phone sequences, phone posteriors, or phonetic bottleneck features, can significantly improve LID accuracy in both the conventional PRLM approach BIBREF11 and the more modern i-vector system BIBREF34 , BIBREF35 , BIBREF36 . In this paper, we will investigate the utilization of phonetic information to improve neural LID. The basic concept is to use a phone-discriminative model to produce frame-level phonetic features, and then use these features to enhance RNN LID systems that were originally built with raw acoustic features. The initial step is therefore feature combination, with the phonetic feature used as auxiliary information to assist acoustic RNN LID. This is improved further, as additional research identified that a simpler model using only the phonetic feature as the RNN LID input provides even better performance. We call this RNN model based on phonetic features the phonetic temporal neural LID approach, or PTN LID. As well as having a simplified model structure, the PTN offers deeper insight into the LID task by rediscovering the value of the phonetic temporal property in language discrimination. This property was historically widely and successfully applied in token-based approaches, e.g., PRLM BIBREF11 , but has been largely overlooked due to the popularity of the i-vector approach.",Investigating the utilization of phonetic information to improve neural LID.,0.2758620644470868,0.0714285670663268,0.2758620644470868,4.141141330484801,35.13208680035436,32.0483119060278,0.1955912334352701,0.005524861878453,0.8030366897583008,0.6873071400130668,0.803036630153656,0.8419042825698853
249,How do they get the formal languages?,These are well-known formal languages some of which was used in the literature to evaluate the learning capabilities of RNNs.,"BIBREF7 investigated the learning capabilities of simple RNNs to process and formalize a context-free grammar containing hierarchical (recursively embedded) dependencies: He observed that distinct parts of the networks were able to learn some complex representations to encode certain grammatical structures and dependencies of the context-free grammar. Later, BIBREF8 introduced an RNN with an external stack memory to learn simple context-free languages, such as $a^n b^m$ , $a^nb^ncb^ma^m$ , and $a^{n+m} b^n c^m$ . Similar studies BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 have explored the existence of stable counting mechanisms in simple RNNs, which would enable them to learn various context-free and context-sensitive languages, but none of the RNN architectures proposed in the early days were able to generalize the training set to longer (or more complex) test samples with substantially high accuracy.
BIBREF9 , on the other hand, proposed a variant of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to learn two context-free languages, $a^n b^n$ , $a^n b^m B^m A^n$ , and one strictly context-sensitive language, $a^n b^n c^n$ . Given only a small fraction of samples in a formal language, with values of $n$ (and $m$ ) ranging from 1 to a certain training threshold $N$ , they trained an LSTM model until its full convergence on the training set and then tested it on a more generalized set. They showed that their LSTM model outperformed the previous approaches in capturing and generalizing the aforementioned formal languages. By analyzing the cell states and the activations of the gates in their LSTM model, they further demonstrated that the network learns how to count up and down at certain places in the sample sequences to encode information about the underlying structure of each of these formal languages.",By training an LSTM model on a small fraction of samples.,0.0689655125326994,0.0,0.0689655125326994,2.159701133933343,18.29472105883348,15.557432428066925,0.0497512437810945,0.0057561486132914,0.2762379646301269,0.2581759334438377,0.2762379050254822,0.1389631778001785

254,How are the keywords associated with events such as protests selected?,"By using a Bayesian approach  and by using word-pairs, where they extract all the pairs of co-occurring words within each tweet.

The third and fourth challenges are approached by using word-pairs, where we extract all the pairs of co-occurring words within each tweet. This allows us to recognize the context of the word ('Messi','strike' ) is different than ('labour','strike').
According to the distributional semantic hypothesis, event-related words are likely to be used on the day of an event more frequently than any normal day before or after the event. This will form a spike in the keyword count magnitude along the timeline as illustrated in Figure FIGREF6 . To find the words most associated with events, we search for the words that achieve the highest number of spikes matching the days of events. We use the Jaccard similarity metric as it values the spikes matching events and penalizes spikes with no event and penalizes events without spikes. Separate words can be noisy due to the misuse of the term by people, especially in big data environments. So, we rather used the word-pairs as textual features in order to capture the context of the word. For example, this can differentiate between the multiple usages of the word “strike” within the contexts of “lightning strike”, “football strike” and “labour strike”","By searching for words with the highest number of spikes matching the days of events, using the Jaccard similarity metric.",0.4583333287586806,0.2857142812308674,0.4583333287586806,24.36670758476217,57.198279192553024,55.67302085460656,0.4078257712102554,0.0068493150684931,0.7408366799354553,0.8072373833989637,0.7338246703147888,0.4867448508739471

To counter that, we use a left-to-right attention mask, similar to the one employed in the original Transformer decoder BIBREF1. For the input tokens in $X$, we apply such mask to all the target tokens $Y$ that were concatenated to $X$, so that input tokens can only attend to the other input tokens.

In order to make the $o_j$ vectors (of dimension $2048+4=2052$) comparable to BERT embeddings (of dimension 768), we use a simple linear cross-modal projection layer $W$ of dimensions $2052\hspace{-1.00006pt}\times \hspace{-1.00006pt}768$. The $N$ object regions detected in an image, are thus represented as $X_{img} = (W.o_1,...,W.o_N)$.

261,What external sources are used?,"Raw data from Gigaword, Automatically segmented text from Gigaword, Heterogenous training data from People's Daily, POS data from People's Daily.","FLOAT SELECTED: Table 3: Statistics of external data.
Neural network models for NLP benefit from pretraining of word/character embeddings, learning distributed sementic information from large raw texts for reducing sparsity. The three basic elements in our neural segmentor, namely characters, character bigrams and words, can all be pretrained over large unsegmented data. We pretrain the five-character window network in Figure FIGREF13 as an unit, learning the MLP parameter together with character and bigram embeddings. We consider four types of commonly explored external data to this end, all of which have been studied for statistical word segmentation, but not for neural network segmentors.
Raw Text. Although raw texts do not contain explicit word boundary information, statistics such as mutual information between consecutive characters can be useful features for guiding segmentation BIBREF11 . For neural segmentation, these distributional statistics can be implicitly learned by pretraining character embeddings. We therefore consider a more explicit clue for pretraining our character window network, namely punctuations BIBREF10 .
Automatically Segmented Text. Large texts automatically segmented by a baseline segmentor can be used for self-training BIBREF13 or deriving statistical features BIBREF12 . We adopt a simple strategy, taking automatically segmented text as silver data to pretrain the five-character window network. Given INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 is derived using the MLP in Figure FIGREF13 , and then used to classify the segmentation of INLINEFORM2 into B(begining)/M(middle)/E(end)/S(single character word) labels. DISPLAYFORM0
Heterogenous Training Data. Multiple segmentation corpora exist for Chinese, with different segmentation granularities. There has been investigation on leveraging two corpora under different annotation standards to improve statistical segmentation BIBREF16 . We try to utilize heterogenous treebanks by taking an external treebank as labeled data, training a B/M/E/S classifier for the character windows network. DISPLAYFORM0
POS Data. Previous research has shown that POS information is closely related to segmentation BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 . We verify the utility of POS information for our segmentor by pretraining a classifier that predicts the POS on each character, according to the character window representation INLINEFORM0 . In particular, given INLINEFORM1 , the POS of the word that INLINEFORM2 belongs to is used as the output.

We can see that the proposed comparative evaluator correlates far better with human judgment than BLEU and perplexity. When compared with recently proposed parameterized metrics including adversarial evaluator and ADEM, our model consistently outperforms them by a large margin, which demonstrates that our comparison-based evaluation metric is able to evaluate sample quality more accurately. In addition, we find that evaluating generated samples by comparing it with a set of randomly selected samples or using sample-level skill rating performs almost equally well. This is not surprising as the employed skill rating is able to handle the inherent variance of players (i.e. NLG models). As this variance does not exist when we regard a sample as a model which always generates the same sample.
Results are shown in Table 2. We can see that the proposed comparative evaluator with skill rating significantly outperforms all compared baselines, including comparative evaluator with averaged sample-level scores. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the skill rating system for performing model-level comparison with pairwise sample-level evaluation. In addition, the poor correlation between conventional evaluation metrics including BLEU and perplexity demonstrates the necessity of better automated evaluation metrics in open domain NLG evaluation.

265,What is a string kernel?,String kernel is a technique that uses character n-grams to measure the similarity of strings.,"In recent years, methods based on string kernels have demonstrated remarkable performance in various text classification tasks BIBREF35 , BIBREF36 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF26 . String kernels represent a way of using information at the character level by measuring the similarity of strings through character n-grams. Lodhi et al. BIBREF35 used string kernels for document categorization, obtaining very good results. String kernels were also successfully used in authorship identification BIBREF22 . More recently, various combinations of string kernels reached state-of-the-art accuracy rates in native language identification BIBREF19 and Arabic dialect identification BIBREF17 . Interestingly, string kernels have been used in cross-domain settings without any domain adaptation, obtaining impressive results. For instance, Ionescu et al. BIBREF19 have employed string kernels in a cross-corpus (and implicitly cross-domain) native language identification experiment, improving the state-of-the-art accuracy by a remarkable INLINEFORM0 . Giménez-Pérez et al. BIBREF10 have used string kernels for single-source and multi-source polarity classification. Remarkably, they obtain state-of-the-art performance without using knowledge from the target domain, which indicates that string kernels provide robust results in the cross-domain setting without any domain adaptation. Ionescu et al. BIBREF17 obtained the best performance in the Arabic Dialect Identification Shared Task of the 2017 VarDial Evaluation Campaign BIBREF37 , with an improvement of INLINEFORM1 over the second-best method. It is important to note that the training and the test speech samples prepared for the shared task were recorded in different setups BIBREF37 , or in other words, the training and the test sets are drawn from different distributions.

270,How do slot binary classifiers improve performance?,By adding extra supervision to generate the slots that will be present in the response.,"This paper proposes the Flexibly-Structured Dialogue Model (FSDM) as a new end-to-end task-oriented dialogue system. The state tracking component of FSDM has the advantages of both fully structured and free-form approaches while addressing their shortcomings. On one hand, it is still structured, as it incorporates information about slots in KB schema; on the other hand, it is flexible, as it does not use information about the values contained in the KB records. This makes it easily adaptable to new values. These desirable properties are achieved by a separate decoder for each informable slot and a multi-label classifier for the requestable slots. Those components explicitly assign values to slots like the fully structured approach, while also preserving the capability of dealing with out-of-vocabulary words like the free-form approach. By using these two types of decoders, FSDM produces only valid belief states, overcoming the limitations of the free-form approach. Further, FSDM has a new module called response slot binary classifier that adds extra supervision to generate the slots that will be present in the response more precisely before generating the final textual agent response (see Section ""Methodology"" for details).",They add extra supervision to generate slots more precisely.,0.4347826039319471,0.2727272680991736,0.4347826039319471,16.94357181593088,59.44775756964319,54.98865561163194,0.3652597402597402,0.0089197224975222,0.6207572221755981,0.7535764140308283,0.6207570433616638,0.9860311150550842
271,what bottlenecks were identified?,Confusion in recognizing the words that are active at a given node by a speech recognition solution developed for Indian Railway Inquiry System.,"In this paper we proposed a methodology to identify words that could lead to confusion at any given node of a speech recognition based system. We used edit distance as the metric to identifying the possible confusion between the active words. We showed that this metric can be used effectively to enhance the performance of a speech solution without actually putting it to people test. There is a significant saving in terms of being able to identify recognition bottlenecks in a menu based speech solution through this analysis because it does not require actual people testing the system. This methodology was adopted to restructuring the set of active words at each node for better speech recognition in an actual menu based speech recognition system that caters to masses.
We hypothesize that we can identify the performance of a menu based speech system by identifying the possible confusion among all the words that are active at a given node. If active words at a given node are phonetically similar it becomes difficult for the speech recognition system to distinguish them which in turn leads to recognition errors. We used Levenshtein distance BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 a well known measure to analyze and identify the confusion among the active words at a given node. This analysis gives a list of all set of words that have a high degree of confusability among them; this understanding can be then used to (a) restructure the set of active words at that node and/or (b) train the words that can be confused by using a larger corpus of speech data. This allows the speech recognition engine to be equipped to be able to distinguish the confusing words better.

Table reports some statistics extracted from the acquired spoken data. Speech was recorded in classrooms, whose equipment depended on each school. In general, around 20 students took the test together, at the same time and in the same classrooms, so it is quite common that speech of mates or teachers often overlaps with the speech of the student speaking in her/his microphone. Also, the type of microphone depends on the equipment of the school. On average, the audio signal quality is nearly good, while the main problem is caused by a high percentage of extraneous speech. This is due to the fact that organisers decided to use a fixed duration - which depends on the question - for recording spoken utterances, so that all the recordings for a given question have the same length. However, while it is rare that a speaker has not enough time to answer, it is quite common that, especially after the end of the utterance, some other speech (e.g. comments, jokes with mates, indications from the teachers, etc.) is captured.

282,What is the state-of-the art?,Neural attention model with a convolutional encoder with an RNN decoder and RNN encoder-decoder.,"Very recently, the success of deep neural networks in many natural language processing tasks ( BIBREF20 ) has inspired new work in abstractive summarization . BIBREF2 propose a neural attention model with a convolutional encoder to solve this task. BIBREF3 build a large dataset for Chinese text summarization and propose to feed all hidden states from the encoder into the decoder. More recently, BIBREF4 extended BIBREF2 's work with an RNN decoder, and BIBREF8 proposed an RNN encoder-decoder architecture for summarization. Both techniques are currently the state-of-the-art on the DUC competition. However, the encoders exploited in these methods lack the ability to encode each word condition on the whole text, as an RNN encodes a word into a hidden vector by taking into account only the words up to that time step. In contrast, in this work we propose a `Read-Again' encoder-decoder architecture, which enables the encoder to understand each input word after reading the whole sentence. Our encoder first reads the text, and the results from the first read help represent the text in the second pass over the source text. Our second contribution is a simple copy mechanism that allows us to significantly reduce the decoder vocabulary size resulting in much faster inference times. Furthermore our copy mechanism allows us to handle out-of-vocabulary words in a principled manner.

FLOAT SELECTED: Table 1. % EER performance of BULATS-trained baseline systems on BULATS and Linguaskill test sets.
Performance of the two baseline systems is shown in Table TABREF9 in terms of equal error rate (EER). The x-vector system yielded lower EERs on both BULATS and Linguaskill test sets.
In addition to the models trained on the BULATS data, it is also interesting to investigate the application of “out-of-the-box"" models for standard speaker verification tasks to this non-native speaker verification task as there is limited amounts of non-native learner English data that is publicly available. In this paper, the Kaldi-released BIBREF19 VoxCeleb x-vector/PLDA system was used as imported models, which was trained on augmented VoxCeleb 1 BIBREF17 and VoxCeleb 2 BIBREF18. There are more than 7,000 speakers in the VoxCeleb dataset with more than 2,000 hours of audio data, making it the largest publicly available speaker recognition dataset. 30 dimensional mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used as input features and system configurations were the same as the BULATS x-vector/PLDA one. It can be seen from Table TABREF10 that these out-of-domain models gave worse performance than baseline systems trained on a far smaller amount of BULATS data due to domain mismatch. Thus, two kinds of in-domain adaptation strategies were explored to make use of the BULATS training set: PLDA adaptation and x-vector extractor fine-tuning. For PLDA adaptation, x-vectors of the BULATS training set were first extracted using the VoxCeleb-trained x-vector extractor, and then employed to adapt the VoxCeleb-trained PLDA model with their mean and variance. For x-vector extractor fine-tuning, with all other layers of the VoxCeleb-trained model kept still, the output layer was re-initialised using the BULATS training set with the number of targets adjusted accordingly, and then all layers were fine-tuned on the BULATS training set. Here the PLDA adaptation system is referred to as X1 and the extractor fine-tuning system is referred to as X2. Both adaptation approaches can yield good performance gains as can be seen from Table TABREF10. PLDA adaptation is a straightforward yet effective way, while the system with x-vector extractor fine-tuning gave slightly lower EERs on both BULATS and Linguaskill test sets by virtue of a relatively “in-domain"" extractor prior to the PLDA back-end.","BULATS-trained baseline systems, VoxCeleb x-vector/PLDA system, PLDA adaptation system (X1), and x-vector extractor fine-tuning system (X2).",0.4799999952000001,0.1538461489644972,0.4799999952000001,18.73917544901102,50.54839080030307,42.65270215931008,0.6884507275132276,0.014336917562724,0.8751952052116394,0.5755813953488372,0.8751951456069946,0.7001857757568359
293,How do they combine MonaLog with BERT?,They use Monalog for data-augmentation to fine-tune BERT on this task.,"In this work, we introduce a new logical inference engine called MonaLog, which is based on natural logic and work on monotonicity stemming from vanBenthemEssays86. In contrast to the logical approaches cited above, our starting point is different in that we begin with the following two questions: 1) what is the simplest logical system that one can come up with to solve empirical NLI problems (i.e., the system with minimal amounts of primitives and background knowledge)?; and 2) what is the lower-bound performance of such a model? Like other approaches to natural logic BIBREF15, BIBREF16, our model works by reasoning over surface forms (as opposed to translating to symbolic representations) using a small inventory of monotonicity facts about quantifiers, lexical items and token-level polarity BIBREF17; proofs in the calculus are hence fully interpretable and expressible in ordinary language. Unlike existing work on natural logic, however, our model avoids the need for having expensive alignment and search sub-procedures BIBREF18, BIBREF19, and relies on a much smaller set of background knowledge and primitive relations than MacCartneyManning.
Since our logic operates over surface forms, it is straightforward to hybridize our models. We investigate using MonaLog in combination with the language model BERT BIBREF20, including for compositional data augmentation, i.e, re-generating entailed versions of examples in our training sets. To our knowledge, our approach is the first attempt to use monotonicity for data augmentation, and we show that such augmentation can generate high-quality training data with which models like BERT can improve performance.
We perform two experiments to test MonaLog. We first use MonaLog to solve the problems in a commonly used natural language inference dataset, SICK BIBREF1, comparing our results with previous systems. Second, we test the quality of the data generated by MonaLog. To do this, we generate more training data (sentence pairs) from the SICK training data using our system, and performe fine-tuning on BERT BIBREF20, a language model based on the transformer architecture BIBREF23, with the expanded dataset. In all experiments, we use the Base, Uncased model of BERT.",They use MonaLog for compositional data augmentation with BERT.,0.39999999505,0.1111111061728397,0.39999999505,8.516593018819643,49.216947978025786,44.26172381395431,0.4766949152542372,0.0126939351198871,0.91267192363739,0.4144971303641795,0.91267192363739,0.7793256640434265

TextCat is not the only example of an off-the-shelf implementation of the out-of-place method: other implementations include libtextcat with 76 language models, JTCL with 15 languages, and mguesser with 104 models for different language-encoding pairs. The main issue addressed by later implementations is classification speed: TextCat is implemented in Perl and is not optimized for speed, whereas implementations such as libtextcat and mguesser have been specifically written to be fast and efficient. whatlang-rs uses an algorithm based on character trigrams and refers the user to the BIBREF7 article. It comes pre-trained with 83 languages.
is the language identifier embedded in the Google Chrome web browser. It uses a NB classifier, and script-specific classification strategies. assumes that all the input is in UTF-8, and assigns the responsibility of encoding detection and transcoding to the user. uses Unicode information to determine the script of the input. also implements a number of pre-processing heuristics to help boost performance on its target domain (web pages), such as stripping character sequences like .jpg. The standard implementation supports 83 languages, and an extended model is also available, that supports 160 languages.
is a Java library that implements a language identifier based on a NB classifier trained over character . The software comes with pre-trained models for 53 languages, using data from Wikipedia. makes use of a range of normalization heuristics to improve the performance on particular languages, including: (1) clustering of Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters to reduce sparseness; (2) removal of “language-independent” characters, and other text normalization; and (3) normalization of Arabic characters.
is a Python implementation of the method described by BIBREF150 , which exploits training data for the same language across multiple different sources of text to identify sequences of characters that are strongly predictive of a given language, regardless of the source of the text. This feature set is combined with a NB classifier, and is distributed with a pre-trained model for 97 languages prepared using data from 5 different text sources. BIBREF151 provide an empirical comparison of to , and and find that it compares favorably both in terms of accuracy and classification speed. There are also implementations of the classifier component (but not the training portion) of in Java, C, and JavaScript.
BIBREF153 uses a vector-space model with per-feature weighting on character sequences. One particular feature of is that it uses discriminative training in selecting features, i.e. it specifically makes use of features that are strong evidence against a particular language, which is generally not captured by NB models. Another feature of is that it uses inter-string smoothing to exploit sentence-level locality in making language predictions, under the assumption that adjacent sentences are likely to be in the same language. BIBREF153 reports that this substantially improves the accuracy of the identifier. Another distinguishing feature of is that it comes pre-trained with data for 1400 languages, which is the highest number by a large margin of any off-the-shelf system.
whatthelang is a recent language identifier written in Python, which utilizes the FastText NN-based text classification algorithm. It supports 176 languages.
implements an off-the-shelf classifier trained using Wikipedia data, covering 122 languages. Although not described as such, the actual classification algorithm used is a linear model, and is thus closely related to both NB and a cosine-based vector space model.
In addition to the above-mentioned general-purpose language identifiers, there have also been efforts to produce pre-trained language identifiers targeted specifically at Twitter messages. is a Twitter-specific tool with built-in models for 19 languages. It uses a document representation based on tries BIBREF401 . The algorithm is a LR classifier using all possible substrings of the data, which is important to maximize the available information from the relatively short Twitter messages.
BIBREF152 provides a comparison of 8 off-the-shelf language identifiers applied without re-training to Twitter messages. One issue they report is that comparing the accuracy of off-the-shelf systems is difficult because of the different subset of languages supported by each system, which may also not fully cover the languages present in the target data. The authors choose to compare accuracy over the full set of languages, arguing that this best reflects the likely use-case of applying an off-the-shelf system to new data. They find that the best individual systems are , and , but that slightly higher accuracy can be attained by a simple voting-based ensemble classifier involving these three systems.
In addition to this, commercial or other closed-source language identifiers and language identifier services exist, of which we name a few. The Polyglot 3000 and Lextek Language Identifier are standalone language identifiers for Windows.

After that, if a cell appears at more than one column, we choose the column name with more overlapped words with the question, with a constraint that the number of co-occurred words is larger than 1. By default, a WHERE operator is INLINEFORM0 , except for the case that surrounding words of a value contain keywords for INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 . Then, we deal with the SELECT column, which has the largest number of co-occurred words and cannot be same with any WHERE column. By default, the SELECT AGG is NONE, except for matching to any keywords in Table TABREF8 . The coverage of our rule on training set is 78.4%, with execution accuracy of 77.9%.
Our rule for KBQA is simple without using a curated mapping dictionary. First, we detect an entity from the question using strict string matching, with the constraint that only one entity from the KB has the same surface string and that the question contains only one entity. After that, we get the connected relations of the detected entity, and assign the relation as the one with maximum number of co-occurred words. The coverage of our rule on training set is 16.0%, with an accuracy of 97.3% for relation prediction.
The pipeline of rules in SequentialQA is similar to that of WikiSQL. Compared to the grammar of WikiSQL, the grammar of SequentialQA has additional actions including copying the previous-turn logical form, no greater than, no more than, and negation.

304,How much more accurate is the model than the baseline?,"For the Oshiete-goo dataset, the NAGM model's ROUGE-L score is higher than the highest performing conventional model, Trans, by 0.021, and its BLEU-4 score is higher than the highest performing model CLSTM by 0.037.  For the nfL6 dataset, the NAGM model's ROUGE-L score is higher than the highest performing conventional model, CLSTM, by 0.028, and its BLEU-4 score is higher than the highest performing model CLSTM by 0.040. Human evaluation of the NAGM's generated outputs for the Oshiete-goo dataset had 47% ratings of (1), the highest rating, while CLSTM only received 21% ratings of (1). For the nfL6 dataset, the comparison of (1)'s was NAGM's 50% to CLSTM's 30%.","NAGMWA is much better than the other methods except NAGM, since it generates answers whose conclusions and supplements as well as their combinations closely match the questions. Thus, conclusions and supplements in the answers are consistent with each other and avoid confusion made by several different conclusion-supplement answers assigned to a single non-factoid questions. Finally, NAGM is consistently superior to the conventional attentive encoder-decoders regardless of the metric. Its ROUGE-L and BLEU-4 scores are much higher than those of CLSTM. Thus, NAGM generates more fluent sentences by assessing the context from conclusion to supplement sentences in addition to the closeness of the question and sentences as well as that of the question and sentence combinations.
The experts asked questions, which were not included in our training datasets, to the AI system and rated the answers; one answer per question. The experts rated the answers as follows: (1) the content of the answer matched the question, and the grammar was okay; (2) the content was suitable, but the grammar was poor; (3) the content was not suitable, but the grammar was okay; (4) both the content and grammar were poor. Note that our evaluation followed the DUC-style strategy. Here, we mean “grammar” to cover grammaticality, non-redundancy, and referential clarity in the DUC strategy, whereas we mean the “content matched the questions” to refer to “focus” and “structure and coherence” in the DUC strategy. The evaluators were given more than a week to carefully evaluate the generated answers, so we consider that their judgments are reliable. Each expert evaluated 50 questions. We combined the scores of the experts by summing them. They did not know the identity of the system in the evaluation and reached their decisions independently.
These results indicate that the experts were much more satisfied with the outputs of NAGM than those of CLSTM. This is because, as can be seen in Table 7, NAGM generated longer and better question-related sentences than CLSTM did. NAGM generated grammatically good answers whose conclusion and supplement statements are well matched with the question and the supplement statement naturally follows the conclusion statement.

306,How are EAC evaluated?,"Qualitatively through efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction aspects and quantitatively through metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, BLEU score and even human judgement.","We characterize the evaluation of Emotionally-Aware Chatbot into two different parts, qualitative and quantitative assessment. Qualitative assessment will focus on assessing the functionality of the software, while quantitative more focus on measure the chatbots' performance with a number.
Based on our investigation of several previous studies, we found that most of the works utilized ISO 9241 to assess chatbots' quality by focusing on the usability aspect. This aspect can be grouped into three focuses, including efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction, concerning systems' performance to achieve the specified goals. Here we will explain every focus based on several categories and quality attributes.
In automatic evaluation, some studies focus on evaluating the system at emotion level BIBREF15 , BIBREF28 . Therefore, some common metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy are used to measure system performance, compared to the gold label. This evaluation is similar to emotion classification tasks such as previous SemEval 2018 BIBREF32 and SemEval 2019 . Other studies also proposed to use perplexity to evaluate the model at the content level (to determine whether the content is relevant and grammatical) BIBREF14 , BIBREF39 , BIBREF28 . This evaluation metric is widely used to evaluate dialogue-based systems which rely on probabilistic approach BIBREF61 . Another work by BIBREF14 used BLEU to evaluate the machine response and compare against the gold response (the actual response), although using BLEU to measure conversation generation task is not recommended by BIBREF62 due to its low correlation with human judgment.
This evaluation involves human judgement to measure the chatbots' performance, based on several criteria. BIBREF15 used three annotators to rate chatbots' response in two criteria, content (scale 0,1,2) and emotion (scale 0,1). Content is focused on measuring whether the response is natural acceptable and could plausible produced by a human. This metric measurement is already adopted and recommended by researchers and conversation challenging tasks, as proposed in BIBREF38 . Meanwhile, emotion is defined as whether the emotion expression contained in the response agrees with the given gold emotion category. Similarly, BIBREF28 used four annotators to score the response based on consistency, logic and emotion. Consistency measures the fluency and grammatical aspect of the response. Logic measures the degree whether the post and response logically match. Emotion measures the response, whether it contains the appropriate emotion. All of these aspects were measured by three scales 0, 1, and 2. Meanwhile, BIBREF39 proposed naturalness and emotion impact as criteria to evaluate the chatbots' response. Naturalness evaluates whether the response is intelligible, logically follows the context of the conversation, and acceptable as a human response, while emotion impact measures whether the response elicits a positive emotional or triggers an emotionally-positive dialogue, since their study focus only on positive emotion. Another study by BIBREF14 uses crowdsourcing to gather human judgement based on three aspects of performance including empathy/sympathy - did the responses show understanding of the feelings of the person talking about their experience?; relevance - did the responses seem appropriate to the conversation? Were they on-topic?; and fluency - could you understand the responses? Did the language seem accurate?. All of these aspects recorded with three different response, i.e., (1: not at all, 3: somewhat, 5: very much) from around 100 different annotators. After getting all of the human judgement with different criteria, some of these studies used a t-test to get the statistical significance BIBREF28 , BIBREF39 , while some other used inter-annotator agreement measurement such as Fleiss Kappa BIBREF15 , BIBREF14 . Based on these evaluations, they can compare their system performance with baseline or any other state of the art systems.","Qualitatively and quantitatively, focusing on usability, efficiency, effectiveness, satisfaction, precision, recall, accuracy, perplexity, and human judgment.",0.4117647009515571,0.1111111062500002,0.4117647009515571,25.983833013159888,64.37574093846855,59.89275105152048,0.4554868087624291,0.0105540897097625,0.7566195726394653,0.8543461631213943,0.7566195726394653,0.5913659930229187

In total, while subject RCs occur 373,186 times, object RCs only occur 106,558 times. We create three additional training datasets by adding sentences involving object RCs to the original Wikipedia corpus (Section lm). To this end, we randomly pick up 30 million sentences from Wikipedia (not overlapped to any sentences in the original corpus), parse by the same parser, and filter sentences containing an object RC, amounting to 680,000 sentences. Among the test cases about object RCs, we compare accuracies on subject-verb agreement, to make a comparison with subject RCs. We also evaluate on “animate only” subset, which has a correspondence to the test cases for subject RC with only differences in word order and inflection (like (UNKREF45) and (UNKREF46); see footnote FOOTREF47). Of particular interest to us is the accuracy on these animate cases. Since the vocabularies are exactly the same, we hypothesize that the accuracy will reach the same level as that on subject RCs with our augmentation.","They add 680,000 sentences with object RCs to the original Wikipedia corpus.",0.4137930985969084,0.0,0.2758620641141499,3.4933841821869938,39.09184593262034,35.56961316912852,0.3040178571428572,0.008498583569405,0.7370071411132812,0.5991333874372335,0.7370070815086365,0.787058413028717

Table TABREF6 describes the various technologies and their presence concerning languages with different levels of resource availability and the ease of data collection. We can observe that for low resource languages, there is considerable difficulty in adopting these tools. Machine Translation can potentially be used as a fix to bridge the gap. Translation engines can help in translating documents from minority languages to majority languages. This allows the pool of data to be used in a number of NLP tasks like sentiment analysis and summarization. Doing so allows us to leverage the existing body of work in NLP done on resource-rich languages and subsequently apply it to the resource-poor languages, thereby foregoing any attempt to reinvent the wheel for these languages.

Drawing on the concept of variance in mathematics, local variance loss is defined as the reciprocal of its variance expecting the attention model to be able to focus on more salient parts. The standard variance calculation is based on the mean of the distribution. However, as previous work BIBREF15, BIBREF16 mentioned that the median value is more robust to outliers than the mean value, we use the median value to calculate the variance of the attention distribution. Thus, local variance loss can be calculated as:
where $\hat{\cdot }$ is a median operator and $\epsilon $ is utilized to avoid zero in the denominator.","As the reciprocal of the variance of the attention distribution, calculated using the median value.",0.5555555508024692,0.49999999545,0.5555555508024692,38.8599000827472,63.926967029714575,61.15489915406295,0.7742990654205608,0.0209790209790209,0.8795744776725769,0.875,0.8795743584632874,0.8594420552253723

The annotation scheme was developed to capture three aspects of classroom talk that are theorized in the literature as important to discussion quality and learning opportunities: argumentation (the process of systematically reasoning in support of an idea), specificity (the quality of belonging or relating uniquely to a particular subject), and knowledge domain (area of expertise represented in the content of the talk).

323,What are the weaknesses of their proposed interpretability quantification method?,Can be biased by dataset used and may generate categories which are suboptimal compared to human designed categories.,"Our interpretability measurements are based on our proposed dataset SEMCAT, which was designed to be a comprehensive dataset that contains a diverse set of word categories. Yet, it is possible that the precise interpretability scores that are measured here are biased by the dataset used. In general, two main properties of the dataset can affect the results: category selection and within-category word selection. To examine the effects of these properties on interpretability evaluations, we create alternative datasets by varying both category selection and word selection for SEMCAT. Since SEMCAT is comprehensive in terms of the words it contains for the categories, these datasets are created by subsampling the categories and words included in SEMCAT. Since random sampling of words within a category may perturb the capacity of the dataset in reflecting human judgement, we subsample r% of the words that are closest to category centers within each category, where $r \in \lbrace 40,60,80,100\rbrace $ . To examine the importance of number of categories in the dataset we randomly select $m$ categories from SEMCAT where $m \in \lbrace 30,50,70,90,110\rbrace $ . We repeat the selection 10 times independently for each $m$ .
In contrast to the category coverage, the effects of within-category word coverage on interpretability scores can be more complex. Starting with few words within each category, increasing the number of words is expected to more uniformly sample from the word distribution, more accurately reflect the semantic relations within each category and thereby enhance interpretability scores. However, having categories over-abundant in words might inevitably weaken semantic correlations among them, reducing the discriminability of the categories and interpretability of the embedding. Table 3 shows that, interestingly, changing the category coverage has different effects on the interpretability scores of different types of embeddings. As category word coverage increases, interpretability scores for random embedding gradually decrease while they monotonically increase for the GloVe embedding. For semantic spaces $\mathcal {I}$ and $\mathcal {I}^*$ , interpretability scores increase as the category coverage increases up to 80 $\%$ of that of SEMCAT, then the scores decrease. This may be a result of having too comprehensive categories as argued earlier, implying that categories with coverage of around 80 $\%$ of SEMCAT are better suited for measuring interpretability. However, it should be noted that the change in the interpretability scores for different word coverages might be effected by non-ideal subsampling of category words. Although our word sampling method, based on words' distances to category centers, is expected to generate categories that are represented better compared to random sampling of category words, category representations might be suboptimal compared to human designed categories.","1.

324,What advantages does their proposed method of quantifying interpretability have over the human-in-the-loop evaluation they compare to?,It is less expensive and quantifies interpretability using continuous values rather than binary evaluations.,"In the word embedding literature, the problem of interpretability has been approached via several different routes. For learning sparse, interpretable word representations from co-occurrence variant matrices, BIBREF21 suggested algorithms based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and the resulting representations are called non-negative sparse embeddings (NNSE). To address memory and scale issues of the algorithms in BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 proposed an online method of learning interpretable word embeddings. In both studies, interpretability was evaluated using a word intrusion test introduced in BIBREF20 . The word intrusion test is expensive to apply since it requires manual evaluations by human observers separately for each embedding dimension. As an alternative method to incorporate human judgement, BIBREF23 proposed joint non-negative sparse embedding (JNNSE), where the aim is to combine text-based similarity information among words with brain activity based similarity information to improve interpretability. Yet, this approach still requires labor-intensive collection of neuroimaging data from multiple subjects.
In addition to investigating the semantic distribution in the embedding space, a word category dataset can be also used to quantify the interpretability of the word embeddings. In several studies, BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF20 , interpretability is evaluated using the word intrusion test. In the word intrusion test, for each embedding dimension, a word set is generated including the top 5 words in the top ranks and a noisy word (intruder) in the bottom ranks of that dimension. The intruder is selected such that it is in the top ranks of a separate dimension. Then, human editors are asked to determine the intruder word within the generated set. The editors' performances are used to quantify the interpretability of the embedding. Although evaluating interpretability based on human judgements is an effective approach, word intrusion is an expensive method since it requires human effort for each evaluation. Furthermore, the word intrusion test does not quantify the interpretability levels of the embedding dimensions, instead it yields a binary decision as to whether a dimension is interpretable or not. However, using continuous values is more adequate than making binary evaluations since interpretability levels may vary gradually across dimensions.","It uses continuous values, not binary decisions, and is less labor-intensive.",0.479999995072,0.0869565168241968,0.239999995072,8.839374326825924,44.67731331959672,42.55388277104857,0.5145413870246085,0.0090834021469859,0.7182582020759583,0.7533535838127137,0.7182582020759583,0.5849319100379944
325,How was lexical diversity measured?,By computing number of unique responses and number of responses divided by the number of unique responses to that question for each of the questions.,"To study the lexical and semantic diversities of responses, we performed three analyses. First, we aggregated all worker responses to a particular question into a single list corresponding to that question. Across all questions, we found that the number of unique responses was higher for the AUI than for the Control (Fig. FIGREF19 A), implying higher diversity for AUI than for Control.
Second, we compared the diversity of individual responses between Control and AUI for each question. To measure diversity for a question, we computed the number of responses divided by the number of unique responses to that question. We call this the response density. A set of responses has a response density of 1 when every response is unique but when every response is the same, the response density is equal to the number of responses. Across the ten questions, response density was significantly lower for AUI than for Control (Wilcoxon signed rank test paired on questions: INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 ) (Fig. FIGREF19 B).",By computing the number of unique responses to a question.,0.6923076875739645,0.4137930991676576,0.6923076875739645,21.165084929516937,64.36556063992154,62.99372921884958,0.3036734693877551,0.0058479532163742,0.9263492822647096,0.9155555555555556,0.92634916305542,0.8131636381149292
326,What human evaluation method is proposed?,Comparing the summary with the text instead of the reference and labeling the candidate bad if it is incorrect or irrelevant.,"More detailed explanation is introduced in Section SECREF2 . Another problem for abstractive text summarization is that the system summary cannot be easily evaluated automatically. ROUGE BIBREF9 is widely used for summarization evaluation. However, as ROUGE is designed for extractive text summarization, it cannot deal with summary paraphrasing in abstractive text summarization. Besides, as ROUGE is based on the reference, it requires high-quality reference summary for a reasonable evaluation, which is also lacking in the existing dataset for Chinese social media text summarization. We argue that for proper evaluation of text generation task, human evaluation cannot be avoided. We propose a simple and practical human evaluation for evaluating text summarization, where the summary is evaluated against the source content instead of the reference. It handles both of the problems of paraphrasing and lack of high-quality reference. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:
For text summarization, a common automatic evaluation method is ROUGE BIBREF9 . The generated summary is evaluated against the reference summary, based on unigram recall (ROUGE-1), bigram recall (ROUGE-2), and recall of longest common subsequence (ROUGE-L). To facilitate comparison with the existing systems, we adopt ROUGE as the automatic evaluation method. The ROUGE is calculated on the character level, following the previous work BIBREF1 . However, for abstractive text summarization, the ROUGE is sub-optimal, and cannot assess the semantic consistency between the summary and the source content, especially when there is only one reference for a piece of text. The reason is that the same content may be expressed in different ways with different focuses. Simple word match cannot recognize the paraphrasing. It is the case for all of the existing large-scale datasets. Besides, as aforementioned, ROUGE is calculated on the character level in Chinese text summarization, making the metrics favor the models on the character level in practice. In Chinese, a word is the smallest semantic element that can be uttered in isolation, not a character. In the extreme case, the generated text could be completely intelligible, but the characters could still match. In theory, calculating ROUGE metrics on the word level could alleviate the problem. However, word segmentation is also a non-trivial task for Chinese. There are many kinds of segmentation rules, which will produce different ROUGE scores. We argue that it is not acceptable to introduce additional systematic bias in automatic evaluations, and automatic evaluation for semantically related tasks can only serve as a reference. To avoid the deficiencies, we propose a simple human evaluation method to assess the semantic consistency. Each summary candidate is evaluated against the text rather than the reference. If the candidate is irrelevant or incorrect to the text, or the candidate is not understandable, the candidate is labeled bad. Otherwise, the candidate is labeled good. Then, we can get an accuracy of the good summaries. The proposed evaluation is very simple and straight-forward. It focuses on the relevance between the summary and the text. The semantic consistency should be the major consideration when putting the text summarization methods into practice, but the current automatic methods cannot judge properly. For detailed guidelines in human evaluation, please refer to Appendix SECREF6 . In the human evaluation, the text-summary pairs are dispatched to two human annotators who are native speakers of Chinese. As in our setting the summary is evaluated against the reference, the number of the pairs needs to be manually evaluated is four times the number of the pairs in the test set, because we need to compare four systems in total. To decrease the workload and get a hint about the annotation quality at the same time, we adopt the following procedure. We first randomly select 100 pairs in the validation set for the two human annotators to evaluate. Each pair is annotated twice, and the inter-annotator agreement is checked. We find that under the protocol, the inter-annotator agreement is quite high. In the evaluation of the test set, a pair is only annotated once to accelerate evaluation. To further maintain consistency, summaries of the same source content will not be distributed to different annotators.","Each summary candidate is evaluated against the text rather than the reference, and labeled as good or bad based on relevance and understandability.",0.4102564052859961,0.047619042630386,0.2564102514398423,5.489146294919027,39.27412960666921,36.16171164521029,0.353702868363096,0.0126165660998354,0.8145493268966675,0.8007183195994451,0.8145492672920227,0.8084885478019714

To our surprise, we found that using attention yields only a marginally higher BLEU score (43.1 vs. 42.8). We suspect that this is due to the fact that generating entailed sentences has a larger space of valid target sequences, which makes the use of BLEU problematic and penalizes correct solutions. Hence, we manually annotated 100 random test sentences and decided whether the generated sentence can indeed be inferred from the source sentence. We found that sentences generated by an LSTM with attention are substantially more accurate ( $82\%$ accuracy) than those generated from an LSTM baseline ( $71.7\%$ ).

Our model introduces a multi-turns inference mechanism to process multi-perspective matching features. Furthermore, the model employs the memory mechanism to carry proceeding inference information. In each turn, the inference is based on the current matching feature and previous memory. Experimental results on SNLI dataset show that the MIMN model is on par with the state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our model achieves new state-of-the-art results on the MPE and the SCITAL datasets. Experimental results prove that the MIMN model can extract important information from multiple premises for the final judgment.

339,How are the potentially relevant text fragments identified?,"Generate a query out of the claim and querying a search engine, rank the words by means of TF-IDF, use IBM's AlchemyAPI to identify named entities, generate queries of 5–10 tokens, which execute against a search engine, and collect the snippets and the URLs in the results, skipping any result that points to a domain that is considered unreliable.","This step consists of generating a query out of the claim and querying a search engine (here, we experiment with Google and Bing) in order to retrieve supporting documents. Rather than querying the search engine with the full claim (as on average, a claim is two sentences long), we generate a shorter query following the lessons highlighted in BIBREF0 .
We rank the words by means of tf-idf. We compute the idf values on a 2015 Wikipedia dump and the English Gigaword. BIBREF0 suggested that a good way to perform high-quality search is to only consider the verbs, the nouns and the adjectives in the claim; thus, we exclude all words in the claim that belong to other parts of speech. Moreover, claims often contain named entities (e.g., names of persons, locations, and organizations); hence, we augment the initial query with all the named entities from the claim's text. We use IBM's AlchemyAPI to identify named entities. Ultimately, we generate queries of 5–10 tokens, which we execute against a search engine. We then collect the snippets and the URLs in the results, skipping any result that points to a domain that is considered unreliable. Finally, if our query has returned no results, we iteratively relax it by dropping the final tokens one at a time.",By querying a search engine with a generated query and collecting snippets and URLs from the results.,0.2711864368859523,0.0833333298765433,0.2372881318012066,5.235900491477758,46.11075207909693,42.82849401091486,0.2157872886473429,0.0033884791708192,0.6571738123893738,0.8719387872351541,0.657173752784729,0.7960562109947205

341,how was annotation done?,Annotation was done with the help of annotators from Amazon Mechanical Turk on snippets of conversations.,"With the gathered comments, we reconstructed the original conversation trees, from the original post, the root, to the leaves, when they were available and selected a subset to annotated. For annotation purposes, we created snippets of conversations as the ones shown in Example 1 and Example 2 consisting of the parent of the suspected trolling event, the suspected trolling event comment, and all of the direct responses to the suspected trolling event. We added an extra constraint that the parent of the suspected trolling event should also be part of the direct responses, we hypothesize that if the suspected trolling event is indeed trolling, its parent should be the object of its trolling and would have a say about it. We recognize that this limited amount of information is not always sufficient to recover the original message conveyed by all of the participants in the snippet, and additional context would be beneficial. However, the trade off is that snippets like this allow us to make use of Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to have the dataset annotated, because it is not a big burden for a “turker” to work on an individual snippet in exchange for a small pay, and expedites the annotation process by distributing it over dozens of people. Specifically, for each snippet, we requested three annotators to label the four aspects previously described. Before annotating, we set up a qualification test along with borderline examples to guide them in process and align them with our criteria. The qualification test turned out to be very selective since only 5% of all of the turkers that attempted it passed the exam. Our dataset consists of 1000 conversations with 5868 sentences and 71033 tokens. The distribution over the classes per trolling aspect is shown in the table TABREF24 in the column “Size”.",Through Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) with three annotators per snippet.,0.3999999952,0.1666666619791668,0.2399999952,10.123734869668828,53.9217248441649,48.29509581015815,0.3802710843373494,0.0070921985815602,0.8824926614761353,0.5996695908543188,0.8824926018714905,0.6905272603034973
342,How do they measure correlation between the prediction and explanation quality?,They look at the performance accuracy of explanation and the prediction performance.,"We would expect that explanation performance should correlate with prediction performance. Since Possible-answer knowledge is primarily needed to decide if the net has enough information to answer the challenge question without guessing and relevant-variable knowledge is needed for the net to know what to query, we analyzed the network's performance on querying and answering separately. The memory network has particular difficulty learning to query relevant variables, reaching only about .5 accuracy when querying. At the same time, it learns to answer very well, reaching over .9 accuracy there. Since these two parts of the interaction are what we ask it to explain in the two modes, we find that the quality of the explanations strongly correlates with the quality of the algorithm executed by the network.",They measure correlation by comparing accuracy scores.,0.2352941128027682,0.0,0.2352941128027682,4.065425428798724,27.987294038823567,25.159436933224534,0.12,0.0069513406156901,0.563133716583252,0.4507252432681896,0.563133716583252,0.5901336669921875
343,How do they incorporate human advice?,By converting human advice to first-order logic format and use as an input to calculate gradient.,"While most relational learning methods restrict the human to merely annotating the data, we go beyond and request the human for advice. The intuition is that we as humans read certain patterns and use them to deduce the nature of the relation between two entities present in the text. The goal of our work is to capture such mental patterns of the humans as advice to the learning algorithm. We modified the work of Odom et al. odomAIME15,odomAAAI15 to learn RDNs in the presence of advice. The key idea is to explicitly represent advice in calculating gradients. This allows the system to trade-off between data and advice throughout the learning phase, rather than only consider advice in initial iterations. Advice, in particular, become influential in the presence of noisy or less amout of data. A few sample advice rules in English (these are converted to first-order logic format and given as input to our algorithm) are presented in Table TABREF11 . Note that some of the rules are “soft"" rules in that they are not true in many situations. Odom et al. odomAAAI15 weigh the effect of the rules against the data and hence allow for partially correct rules.",They explicitly represent advice in calculating gradients.,0.0909090865702481,0.0,0.0909090865702481,2.719665272174911,35.709003518815486,29.372499722118533,0.2329192546583851,0.0046449900464499,0.6398019194602966,0.6762943813295075,0.6398019194602966,0.6994362473487854

We assume it is more likely that politicians or news agencies are addressees of offensive language than, for instance, musicians or athletes. To make use of such information, we obtain a clustering of user ids from our Twitter background corpus. From all tweets in our stream from 2016 or 2017, we extract those tweets that have at least two @-mentions and all of the @-mentions have been seen at least five times in the background corpus. Based on the resulting 1.8 million lists of about 169,000 distinct user ids, we compute a topic model with INLINEFORM0 topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation BIBREF3 . For each of the user ids, we extract the most probable topic from the inferred user id-topic distribution as cluster id. This results in a thematic cluster id for most of the user ids in our background corpus grouping together accounts such as American or German political actors, musicians, media websites or sports clubs (see Table TABREF17 ).

From the table, we can first see that the LSTM-based architecture performed better than the CNN- and transformer- based architectures.

355,What is the metric that is measures in this paper?,Error rate in a minimal pair ABX discrimination task.,"To test if the learned representations can separate phonetic categories, we use a minimal pair ABX discrimination task BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 . It only requires to define a dissimilarity function $d$ between speech tokens, no external training algorithm is needed. We define the ABX-discriminability of category $x$ from category $y$ as the probability that $A$ and $X$ are further apart than $B$ and $X$ when $A$ and $X$ are from category $x$ and $x$0 is from category $x$1 , according to a dissimilarity function $x$2 . Here, we focus on phone triplet minimal pairs: sequences of 3 phonemes that differ only in the central one (“beg”-“bag”, “api”-“ati”, etc.). For the within-speaker task, all the phones triplets belong to the same speaker (e.g. $x$3 ) Finally the scores for every pair of central phones are averaged and subtracted from 1 to yield the reported within-talker ABX error rate. For the across-speaker task, $x$4 and $x$5 belong to the same speaker, and $x$6 to a different one (e.g. $x$7 ). The scores for a given minimal pair are first averaged across all of the pairs of speakers for which this contrast can be made.

356,What are the two decoding functions?,"A linear projection and a bijective function with continuous transformation though  ‘affine coupling layer’ of (Dinh et al.,2016).","In this case, the decoding function is a linear projection, which is $= f_{\text{de}}()=+ $ , where $\in ^{d_\times d_}$ is a trainable weight matrix and $\in ^{d_\times 1}$ is the bias term.
A family of bijective transformation was designed in NICE BIBREF17 , and the simplest continuous bijective function $f:^D\rightarrow ^D$ and its inverse $f^{-1}$ is defined as:
$$h: \hspace{14.22636pt} _1 &= _1, & _2 &= _2+m(_1) \nonumber \\ h^{-1}: \hspace{14.22636pt} _1 &= _1, & _2 &= _2-m(_1) \nonumber $$ (Eq. 15)
where $_1$ is a $d$ -dimensional partition of the input $\in ^D$ , and $m:^d\rightarrow ^{D-d}$ is an arbitrary continuous function, which could be a trainable multi-layer feedforward neural network with non-linear activation functions. It is named as an `additive coupling layer' BIBREF17 , which has unit Jacobian determinant. To allow the learning system to explore more powerful transformation, we follow the design of the `affine coupling layer' BIBREF24 :
$$h: \hspace{5.69046pt} _1 &= _1, & _2 &= _2 \odot \text{exp}(s(_1)) + t(_1) \nonumber \\ h^{-1}: \hspace{5.69046pt} _1 &= _1, & _2 &= (_2-t(_1)) \odot \text{exp}(-s(_1)) \nonumber $$ (Eq. 16)
where $s:^d\rightarrow ^{D-d}$ and $t:^d\rightarrow ^{D-d}$ are both neural networks with linear output units.
The requirement of the continuous bijective transformation is that, the dimensionality of the input $$ and the output $$ need to match exactly. In our case, the output $\in ^{d_}$ of the decoding function $f_{\text{de}}$ has lower dimensionality than the input $\in ^{d_}$ does. Our solution is to add an orthonormal regularised linear projection before the bijective function to transform the vector representation of a sentence to the desired dimension.","$f_{\text{de}}()=+ $ and $h: \hspace{5.69046pt} _1 &= _1, & _2 &= _2 \odot \text{exp}(s(_1)) + t(_1) $.",0.0588235244809692,0.0,0.0588235244809692,0.4660928145256264,6.892066552699536,6.12056421058572,0.0784313725490196,0.0099009900990099,0.2034447491168975,0.0801087857076998,0.2034447342157364,0.2270554900169372

Next, we further explore the impact of sequence length using BERT-LARGE. The model took approximately 3 days to pre-train when using 4 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti.

359,What metric is used to measure performance?,"Accuracy and F1 score for supervised tasks, Pearson's and Spearman's correlation for unsupervised tasks.","We use a standard set of supervised as well as unsupervised benchmark tasks from the literature to evaluate our trained models, following BIBREF16 . The breadth of tasks allows to fairly measure generalization to a wide area of different domains, testing the general-purpose quality (universality) of all competing sentence embeddings. For downstream supervised evaluations, sentence embeddings are combined with logistic regression to predict target labels. In the unsupervised evaluation for sentence similarity, correlation of the cosine similarity between two embeddings is compared to human annotators.
Downstream Supervised Evaluation. Sentence embeddings are evaluated for various supervised classification tasks as follows. We evaluate paraphrase identification (MSRP) BIBREF25 , classification of movie review sentiment (MR) BIBREF26 , product reviews (CR) BIBREF27 , subjectivity classification (SUBJ) BIBREF28 , opinion polarity (MPQA) BIBREF29 and question type classification (TREC) BIBREF30 . To classify, we use the code provided by BIBREF22 in the same manner as in BIBREF16 . For the MSRP dataset, containing pairs of sentences INLINEFORM0 with associated paraphrase label, we generate feature vectors by concatenating their Sent2Vec representations INLINEFORM1 with the component-wise product INLINEFORM2 . The predefined training split is used to tune the L2 penalty parameter using cross-validation and the accuracy and F1 scores are computed on the test set. For the remaining 5 datasets, Sent2Vec embeddings are inferred from input sentences and directly fed to a logistic regression classifier. Accuracy scores are obtained using 10-fold cross-validation for the MR, CR, SUBJ and MPQA datasets. For those datasets nested cross-validation is used to tune the L2 penalty. For the TREC dataset, as for the MRSP dataset, the L2 penalty is tuned on the predefined train split using 10-fold cross-validation, and the accuracy is computed on the test set.
Unsupervised Similarity Evaluation. We perform unsupervised evaluation of the learnt sentence embeddings using the sentence cosine similarity, on the STS 2014 BIBREF31 and SICK 2014 BIBREF32 datasets. These similarity scores are compared to the gold-standard human judgements using Pearson's INLINEFORM0 BIBREF33 and Spearman's INLINEFORM1 BIBREF34 correlation scores. The SICK dataset consists of about 10,000 sentence pairs along with relatedness scores of the pairs.

Even simple quantities, like letter frequency, can be used to decode simple substitution cryptogramsBIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10. However, probably the most surprising result in the field is Zipf's law, which states that if one ranks words by their frequency in a large text, the resulting rank frequency distribution is approximately a power law, for all languages BIBREF0, BIBREF11. These kind of universal results have long piqued the interest of physicists and mathematicians, as well as linguistsBIBREF12, BIBREF13, BIBREF14. Indeed, a large amount of effort has been devoted to try to understand the origin of Zipf's law, in some cases arguing that it arises from the fact that texts carry information BIBREF15, all the way to arguing that it is the result of mere chance BIBREF16, BIBREF17. Another interesting characterization of texts is the Heaps-Herdan law, which describes how the vocabulary -that is, the set of different words- grows with the size of a text, the number of which, empirically, has been found to grow as a power of the text size BIBREF18, BIBREF19.

Best state-of-the art parser overall achieves 95.8 UAS and 94.6 LAS.,"Table TABREF12 compares our novel system with other state-of-the-art transition-based dependency parsers on the PT-SD. Greedy parsers are in the first block, beam-search and dynamic programming parsers in the second block. The third block shows the best result on this benchmark, obtained with constituent parsing with generative re-ranking and conversion to dependencies. Despite being the only non-projective parser tested on a practically projective dataset, our parser achieves the highest score among greedy transition-based models (even above those trained with a dynamic oracle).
We even slightly outperform the arc-swift system of Qi2017, with the same model architecture, implementation and training setup, but based on the projective arc-eager transition-based parser instead. This may be because our system takes into consideration any permissible attachment between the focus word INLINEFORM0 and any word in INLINEFORM1 at each configuration, while their approach is limited by the arc-eager logic: it allows all possible rightward arcs (possibly fewer than our approach as the arc-eager stack usually contains a small number of words), but only one leftward arc is permitted per parser state. It is also worth noting that the arc-swift and NL-Covington parsers have the same worst-case time complexity, ( INLINEFORM2 ), as adding non-local arc transitions to the arc-eager parser increases its complexity from linear to quadratic, but it does not affect the complexity of the Covington algorithm. Thus, it can be argued that this technique is better suited to Covington than to arc-eager parsing.

364,How is the architecture fault-tolerant?,By using Apache Spark which stores all executions in a lineage graph and recovers to the previous steady state from any fault.,"KryptoOracle has been built in the Apache ecosystem and uses Apache Spark. Data structures in Spark are based on resilient distributed datasets (RDD), a read only multi-set of data which can be distributed over a cluster of machines and is fault tolerant. Spark applications run as separate processes on different clusters and are coordinated by the Spark object also referred to as the SparkContext. This element is the main driver of the program which connects with the cluster manager and helps acquire executors on different nodes to allocate resource across applications. Spark is highly scalable, being 100x faster than Hadoop on large datasets, and provides out of the box libraries for both streaming and machine learning.
Spark RDD has the innate capability to recover itself because it stores all execution steps in a lineage graph. In case of any faults in the system, Spark redoes all the previous executions from the built DAG and recovers itself to the previous steady state from any fault such as memory overload. Spark RDDs lie in the core of KryptoOracle and therefore make it easier for it to recover from faults. Moreover, faults like memory overload or system crashes may require for the whole system to hard reboot. However, due to the duplicate copies of the RDDs in Apache Hive and the stored previous state of the machine learning model, KryptoOracle can easily recover to the previous steady state.","Through resilient distributed datasets (RDD) and duplicate copies in Apache Hive, allowing for recovery from faults and system crashes.",0.1999999950500001,0.0,0.0999999950500002,2.4623373672221804,26.676441640888115,22.83146597178891,0.1304347826086956,0.0089664936290703,0.5597342848777771,0.4246490488861508,0.5597342252731323,0.0407768040895462

The aim of the inference task is to predict whether the premise sentence entails or contradicts the hypothesis sentence. We use the standard overall accuracy to evaluate the performance.
The aim of the relation extraction task is to predict relations and their types between the two entities mentioned in the sentences. The relations with types were compared to annotated data. We use the standard micro-average precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
The aim of the named entity recognition task is to predict mention spans given in the text BIBREF20 . The results are evaluated through a comparison of the set of mention spans annotated within the document with the set of mention spans predicted by the model. We evaluate the results by using the strict version of precision, recall, and F1-score. For disjoint mentions, all spans also must be strictly correct. To construct the dataset, we used spaCy to split the text into a sequence of tokens when the original datasets do not provide such information.
The sentence similarity task is to predict similarity scores based on sentence pairs. Following common practice, we evaluate similarity by using Pearson correlation coefficients.

367,What are the tasks that this method has shown improvements?,"Bilingual dictionary induction, monolingual and cross-lingual word similarity, and cross-lingual hypernym discovery.","Our experimental results show that the proposed additional transformation does not only benefit cross-lingual evaluation tasks, but, perhaps surprisingly, also monolingual ones. In particular, we perform an extensive set of experiments on standard benchmarks for bilingual dictionary induction and monolingual and cross-lingual word similarity, as well as on an extrinsic task: cross-lingual hypernym discovery.
Tables 2 and 3 show the monolingual and cross-lingual word similarity results, respectively. For both the monolingual and cross-lingual settings, we can notice that our models generally outperform the corresponding baselines. Moreover, in cases where no improvement is obtained, the differences tend to be minimal, with the exception of RG-65, but this is a very small test set for which larger variations can thus be expected. In contrast, there are a few cases where substantial gains were obtained by using our model. This is most notable for English WordSim and SimLex in the monolingual setting.
As can be seen in Table 1 , our refinement method consistently improves over the baselines (i.e., VecMap and MUSE) on all language pairs and metrics. The higher scores indicate that the two monolingual embedding spaces become more tightly integrated because of our additional transformation. It is worth highlighting here the case of English-Finnish, where the gains obtained in $P@5$ and $P@10$ are considerable. This might indicate that our approach is especially useful for morphologically richer languages such as Finnish, where the limitations of the previous bilingual mappings are most apparent.
The results listed in Table 4 indicate several trends. First and foremost, in terms of model-wise comparisons, we observe that our proposed alterations of both VecMap and MUSE improve their quality in a consistent manner, across most metrics and data configurations. In Italian our proposed model shows an improvement across all configurations. However, in Spanish VecMap emerges as a highly competitive baseline, with our model only showing an improved performance when training data in this language abounds (in this specific case there is an increase from 17.2 to 19.5 points in the MRR metric). This suggests that the fact that the monolingual spaces are closer in our model is clearly beneficial when hybrid training data is given as input, opening up avenues for future work on weakly-supervised learning. Concerning the other baseline, MUSE, the contribution of our proposed model is consistent for both languages, again becoming more apparent in the Italian split and in a fully cross-lingual setting, where the improvement in MRR is almost 3 points (from 10.6 to 13.3). Finally, it is noteworthy that even in the setting where no training data from the target language is leveraged, all the systems based on cross-lingual embeddings outperform the best unsupervised baseline, which is a very encouraging result with regards to solving tasks for languages on which training data is not easily accessible or not directly available.","Bilingual dictionary induction, monolingual and cross-lingual word similarity, and cross-lingual hypernym discovery.",0.999999995,0.999999995,0.999999995,100.00000000000004,100.0,100.0,0.999851851851852,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
368,Why does the model improve in monolingual spaces as well? ,Because word pair similarity increases if the two words translate to similar parts of the cross-lingual embedding space.,"As a complement of this analysis we show some qualitative results which give us further insights on the transformations of the vector space after our average approximation. In particular, we analyze the reasons behind the higher quality displayed by our bilingual embeddings in monolingual settings. While VecMap and MUSE do not transform the initial monolingual spaces, our model transforms both spaces simultaneously. In this analysis we focus on the source language of our experiments (i.e., English). We found interesting patterns which are learned by our model and help understand these monolingual gains. For example, a recurring pattern is that words in English which are translated to the same word, or to semantically close words, in the target language end up closer together after our transformation. For example, in the case of English-Spanish the following pairs were among the pairs whose similarity increased the most by applying our transformation: cellphone-telephone, movie-film, book-manuscript or rhythm-cadence, which are either translated to the same word in Spanish (i.e., teléfono and película in the first two cases) or are already very close in the Spanish space. More generally, we found that word pairs which move together the most tend to be semantically very similar and belong to the same domain, e.g., car-bicycle, opera-cinema, or snow-ice.","The model transforms both spaces simultaneously, causing semantically similar words to move closer together.",0.1935483821436005,0.0,0.1290322531113425,2.862999365766888,29.64070338516732,25.24621814330811,0.160427807486631,0.0086741016109045,0.6271280646324158,0.5790488792391946,0.627128005027771,0.7439732551574707
369,How is annotation projection done when languages have different word order?,"Word alignments are generated for parallel text, and aligned words are assumed to also share AMR node alignments.","AMR is not grounded in the input sentence, therefore there is no need to change the AMR annotation when projecting to another language. We think of English labels for the graph nodes as ones from an independent language, which incidentally looks similar to English. However, in order to train state-of-the-art AMR parsers, we also need to project the alignments between AMR nodes and words in the sentence (henceforth called AMR alignments). We use word alignments, similarly to other annotation projection work, to project the AMR alignments to the target languages.
Our approach depends on an underlying assumption that we make: if a source word is word-aligned to a target word and it is AMR aligned with an AMR node, then the target word is also aligned to that AMR node. More formally, let $S = s_1 \dots s_{\vert s \vert }$ be the source language sentence and $T = t_1 \dots t_{\vert t \vert }$ be the target language sentence; $A_s(\cdot )$ be the AMR alignment mapping word tokens in $S$ to the set of AMR nodes that are triggered by it; $A_t(\cdot )$ be the same function for $T$ ; $v$ be a node in the AMR graph; and finally, $W(\cdot )$ be an alignment that maps a word in $S$ to a subset of words in $T$ . Then, the AMR projection assumption is: $T = t_1 \dots t_{\vert t \vert }$0
Word alignments were generated using fast_align BIBREF10 , while AMR alignments were generated with JAMR BIBREF11 . AMREager BIBREF12 was chosen as the pre-existing English AMR parser. AMREager is an open-source AMR parser that needs only minor modifications for re-use with other languages. Our multilingual adaptation of AMREager is available at http://www.github.com/mdtux89/amr-eager-multilingual. It requires tokenization, POS tagging, NER tagging and dependency parsing, which for English, German and Chinese are provided by CoreNLP BIBREF13 .

This means that the dataset contains various kinds of noise, especially due to incoherent contexts. The contextual noise presents an interesting test-case that supplements existing datasets that are sourced from mostly coherent and well-formed text.
We prepare our dataset from the local-context version of Wikilinks, and resolve ground-truth links using a Wikipedia dump from April 2016. We use the page and redirect tables for resolution, and keep the database pageid column as a unique identifier for Wikipedia entities.

374,Is it a neural model? How is it trained?,"No, it is a probabilistic model trained by finding feature weights through gradient ascent.","Here we describe the components of our probabilistic model of question generation.

The remaining sections cover optimization, the program features, and alternative models (Sections ""Optimization"" - ""Alternative models"" ).
The details of optimization are as follows. First, a large set of 150,000 questions is sampled in order to approximate the gradient at each step via importance sampling. Second, to run the procedure for a given model and training set, we ran 100,000 iterations of gradient ascent at a learning rate of 0.1. Last, for the purpose of evaluating the model (computing log-likelihood), the importance sampler is also used to approximate the normalizing constant in Eq. 14 via the estimator $Z \approx \mathbb {E}_{x\sim q}[\frac{p(x;\mathbf {\theta })}{q(x)}]$ .","Yes, it is a neural model.

375,How they evaluate quality of generated output?,Through human evaluation where they are asked to evaluate the generated output on a likert scale.,"Automatic evaluation of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems is a challenging task BIBREF22. For QG, $n$-gram based similarity metrics are commonly used. These measures evaluate how similar the generated text is to the corresponding reference(s). While they are known to suffer from several shortcomings BIBREF29, BIBREF30, they allow to evaluate specific properties of the developed models. In this work, the metrics detailed below are proposed and we evaluate their quality through a human evaluation in subsection SECREF32.
In addition to the automatic metrics, we proceeded to a human evaluation. We chose to use the data from our SQuAD-based experiments in order to also to measure the effectiveness of the proposed approach to derive Curiosity-driven QG data from a standard, non-conversational, QA dataset. We randomly sampled 50 samples from the test set. Three professional English speakers were asked to evaluate the questions generated by: humans (i.e. the reference questions), and models trained using pre-training (PT) or (RL), and all combinations of those methods.
Before submitting the samples for human evaluation, the questions were shuffled. Ratings were collected on a 1-to-5 likert scale, to measure to what extent the generated questions were: answerable by looking at their context; grammatically correct; how much external knowledge is required to answer; relevant to their context; and, semantically sound. The results of the human evaluation are reported in Table TABREF33.",Human evaluation and automatic metrics.,0.0952380916099774,0.0,0.0952380916099774,2.719665272174911,36.04586839681572,30.09923791387062,0.1607267645003494,0.0035587188612099,0.5706775188446045,0.6671416376058649,0.5706775784492493,0.6796510815620422
376,How are sentence embeddings incorporated into the speech recognition system?,BERT generates sentence embeddings that represent words in context. These sentence embeddings are merged into a single conversational-context vector that is used to calculate a gated embedding and is later combined with the output of the decoder h to provide the gated activations for the next hidden layer.,"There exist many word/sentence embeddings which are publicly available. We can broadly classify them into two categories: (1) non-contextual word embeddings, and (2) contextual word embeddings. Non-contextual word embeddings, such as Word2Vec BIBREF1 , GloVe BIBREF39 , fastText BIBREF17 , maps each word independently on the context of the sentence where the word occur in. Although it is easy to use, it assumes that each word represents a single meaning which is not true in real-word. Contextualized word embeddings, sentence embeddings, such as deep contextualized word representations BIBREF20 , BERT BIBREF22 , encode the complex characteristics and meanings of words in various context by jointly training a bidirectional language model. The BERT model proposed a masked language model training approach enabling them to also learn good “sentence” representation in order to predict the masked word.
In this work, we explore both types of embeddings to learn conversational-context embeddings as illustrated in Figure 1 . The first method is to use word embeddings, fastText, to generate 300-dimensional embeddings from 10k-dimensional one-hot vector or distribution over words of each previous word and then merge into a single context vector, $e^k_{context}$ . Since we also consider multiple word/utterance history, we consider two simple ways to merge multiple embeddings (1) mean, and (2) concatenation. The second method is to use sentence embeddings, BERT. It is used to a generate single 786-dimensional sentence embedding from 10k-dimensional one-hot vector or distribution over previous words and then merge into a single context vector with two different merging methods. Since our A2W model uses a restricted vocabulary of 10k as our output units and which is different from the external embedding models, we need to handle out-of-vocabulary words. For fastText, words that are missing in the pretrained embeddings we map them to a random multivariate normal distribution with the mean as the sample mean and variance as the sample variance of the known words. For BERT, we use its provided tokenizer to generates byte pair encodings to handle OOV words.
Using this approach, we can obtain a more dense, informative, fixed-length vectors to encode conversational-context information, $e^k_{context}$ to be used in next $k$ -th utterance prediction.
We use contextual gating mechanism in our decoder network to combine the conversational-context embeddings with speech and word embeddings effectively. Our gating is contextual in the sense that multiple embeddings compute a gate value that is dependent on the context of multiple utterances that occur in a conversation. Using these contextual gates can be beneficial to decide how to weigh the different embeddings, conversational-context, word and speech embeddings. Rather than merely concatenating conversational-context embeddings BIBREF6 , contextual gating can achieve more improvement because its increased representational power using multiplicative interactions.
Figure 2 illustrates our proposed contextual gating mechanism. Let $e_w = e_w(y_{u-1})$ be our previous word embedding for a word $y_{u-1}$ , and let $e_s = e_s(x^k_{1:T})$ be a speech embedding for the acoustic features of current $k$ -th utterance $x^k_{1:T}$ and $e_c = e_c(s_{k-1-n:k-1})$ be our conversational-context embedding for $n$ -number of preceding utterances ${s_{k-1-n:k-1}}$ . Then using a gating mechanism:
$$g = \sigma (e_c, e_w, e_s)$$ (Eq. 15)
where $\sigma $ is a 1 hidden layer DNN with $\texttt {sigmoid}$ activation, the gated embedding $e$ is calcuated as
$$e = g \odot (e_c, e_w, e_s) \\ h = \text{LSTM}(e)$$ (Eq. 16)
and fed into the LSTM decoder hidden layer. The output of the decoder $h$ is then combined with conversational-context embedding $e_c$ again with a gating mechanism,
$$g = \sigma (e_C, h) \\ \hat{h} = g \odot (e_c, h)$$ (Eq. 17)
Then the next hidden layer takes these gated activations, $\hat{h}$ , and so on.","They are used to generate a single 786-dimensional sentence embedding from 10k-dimensional one-hot vector or distribution over previous words, then merged into a single context vector with two different merging methods.",0.3636363587511479,0.1066666619235557,0.2424242375390267,6.82604295041865,42.82899350409853,38.695048333634375,0.1947868141821946,0.0075042362624061,0.627116322517395,0.6502293463452948,0.6798563599586487,0.7812920212745667

380,how did they ask if a tweet was racist?,"If it includes  negative utterances, negative generalizations and insults concerning ethnicity, nationality, religion and culture.","The classification of racist insults presents us with the problem of giving an adequate definition of racism. More so than in other domains, judging whether an utterance is an act of racism is highly personal and does not easily fit a simple definition. The Belgian anti-racist law forbids discrimination, violence and crime based on physical qualities (like skin color), nationality or ethnicity, but does not mention textual insults based on these qualities. Hence, this definition is not adequate for our purposes, since it does not include the racist utterances one would find on social media; few utterances that people might perceive as racist are actually punishable by law, as only utterances which explicitly encourage the use of violence are illegal. For this reason, we use a common sense definition of racist language, including all negative utterances, negative generalizations and insults concerning ethnicity, nationality, religion and culture. In this, we follow paolo2015racist, bonilla2002linguistics and razavi2010offensive, who show that racism is no longer strictly limited to physical or ethnic qualities, but can also include social and cultural aspects.",They used a common sense definition of racist language.,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0244462660665508,18.56673116510457,14.9999158734344,0.0276243093922651,0.0059642147117296,0.4598892331123352,0.4852543928556971,0.4598892629146576,0.3748680651187897
381,How does the model compute the likelihood of executing to the correction semantic denotation?,By treating logical forms as a latent variable and training a discriminative log-linear model over logical form y given x.,"Since the training data consists only of utterance-denotation pairs, the ranker is trained to maximize the log-likelihood of the correct answer $z$ by treating logical forms as a latent variable:
It is impractical to rely solely on a neural decoder to find the most likely logical form at run time in the weakly-supervised setting. One reason is that although the decoder utilizes global utterance features for generation, it cannot leverage global features of the logical form since a logical form is conditionally generated following a specific tree-traversal order. To this end, we follow previous work BIBREF21 and introduce a ranker to the system. The role of the ranker is to score the candidate logical forms generated by the parser; at test time, the logical form receiving the highest score will be used for execution. The ranker is a discriminative log-linear model over logical form $y$ given utterance $x$ :",It maximizes the log-likelihood of the correct answer $z$.,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.8160849415439309,19.26382637189798,15.47247971961427,0.0248756218905472,0.0044798407167745,0.1865404546260833,0.378278351492352,0.1865404695272445,0.269583910703659

384,What limitations are mentioned?,"Deciding publisher partisanship, risk annotator bias because of short description text provided to annotators.","We identified some limitations during the process, which we describe in this section.
When deciding publisher partisanship, the number of people from whom we computed the score was small. For example, de Stentor is estimated to reach 275K readers each day on its official website. Deciding the audience leaning from 55 samples was subject to sampling bias. Besides, the scores differ very little between publishers. None of the publishers had an absolute score higher than 1, meaning that even the most partisan publisher was only slightly partisan. Deciding which publishers we consider as partisan and which not is thus not very reliable.
The article-level annotation task was not as well-defined as on a crowdsourcing platform. We included the questions as part of an existing survey and didn't want to create much burden to the annotators. Therefore, we did not provide long descriptive text that explained how a person should annotate an article. We thus run under the risk of annotator bias. This is one of the reasons for a low inter-rater agreement.","Sampling bias, annotator bias, and low inter-rater agreement.",0.095238090793651,0.0,0.095238090793651,5.816635421147515,28.905973954194348,27.02524620277908,0.2036290322580645,0.0061162079510703,0.5448212623596191,0.6480662182748662,0.5448212027549744,0.4273605942726135

395,How does the semi-automatic construction process work?,Automatic transcription of 5000 tokens through sequential neural models trained on the annotated part of the corpus.,"In order to make the corpus collection easier and faster, we adopted a semi-automatic procedure based on sequential neural models BIBREF19, BIBREF20. Since transcribing Arabish into Arabic is by far the most important information to study the Arabish code-system, the semi-automatic procedure concerns only transcription from Arabish to Arabic script. In order to proceed, we used the first group of (roughly) 6,000 manually transcribed tokens as training and test data sets in a 10-fold cross validation setting with 9-1 proportions for training and test, respectively. As we explained in the previous section, French tokens were removed from the data. More precisely, whole sentences containing non-transcribable French tokens (code-switching) were removed from the data. Since at this level there is no way for predicting when a French word can be transcribed into Arabic and when it has to be left unchanged, French tokens create some noise for an automatic, probabilistic model. After removing sentences with French tokens, the data reduced to roughly 5,000 tokens. We chose this amount of tokens for annotation blocks in our incremental annotation procedure.
We note that by combining sentence, paragraph and token index in the corpus, whole sentences can be reconstructed. However, from 5,000 tokens roughly 300 sentences could be reconstructed, which are far too few to be used for training a neural model. Instead, since tokens are transcribed at morpheme level, we split Arabish tokens into characters, and Arabic tokens into morphemes, and we treated each token itself as a sequence. Our model learns thus to map Arabish characters into Arabic morphemes.
The 10-fold cross validation with this setting gave a token-level accuracy of roughly 71%. This result is not satisfactory on an absolute scale, however it is more than encouraging taking into account the small size of our data. This result means that less than 3 tokens, on average, out of 10, must be corrected to increase the size of our corpus. With this model we automatically transcribed into Arabic morphemes, roughly, 5,000 additional tokens, corresponding to the second annotation block. This can be manually annotated in at least 7,5 days, but thanks to the automatic annotation accuracy, it was manually corrected into 3 days. The accuracy of the model on the annotation of the second block was roughly 70%, which corresponds to the accuracy on the test set. The manually-corrected additional tokens were added to the training data of our neural model, and a new block was automatically annotated and manually corrected. Both accuracy on the test set and on the annotation block remained at around 70%. This is because the block added to the training data was significantly different from the previous and from the third. Adding the third block to the training data and annotating a fourth block with the new trained model gave in contrast an accuracy of roughly 80%. This incremental, semi-automatic transcription procedure is in progress for the remaining blocks, but it is clear that it will make the corpus annotation increasingly easier and faster as the amount of training data will grow up.","It uses a sequential neural model with 10-fold cross validation, incrementally adding manually corrected data to improve accuracy.",0.1212121162534437,0.0606060556106523,0.1212121162534437,3.80640298278295,30.614795305528737,25.54650858801136,0.206043956043956,0.0104772991850989,0.2788750231266022,0.5042239679230585,0.2788749933242798,0.3302775025367737
396,"What does ""explicitly leverages their probabilistic correlation to guide the training process of both models"" mean?","The framework jointly learns parametrized QA and QG models subject to the constraint in equation 2. In more detail, they minimize QA and QG loss functions, with a third dual loss for regularization.","Moreover, QA and QG have probabilistic correlation as both tasks relate to the joint probability between $q$ and $a$ . Given a question-answer pair $\langle q, a \rangle $ , the joint probability $P(q, a)$ can be computed in two equivalent ways.
$$P(q, a) = P(a) P(q|a) = P(q)P(a|q)$$ (Eq. 1)
The conditional distribution $P(q|a)$ is exactly the QG model, and the conditional distribution $P(a|q)$ is closely related to the QA model. Existing studies typically learn the QA model and the QG model separately by minimizing their own loss functions, while ignoring the probabilistic correlation between them.
Based on these considerations, we introduce a training framework that exploits the duality of QA and QG to improve both tasks. There might be different ways of exploiting the duality of QA and QG. In this work, we leverage the probabilistic correlation between QA and QG as the regularization term to influence the training process of both tasks. Specifically, the training objective of our framework is to jointly learn the QA model parameterized by $\theta _{qa}$ and the QG model parameterized by $\theta _{qg}$ by minimizing their loss functions subject to the following constraint.
$$P_a(a) P(q|a;\theta _{qg}) = P_q(q)P(a|q;\theta _{qa})$$ (Eq. 3)
$P_a(a)$ and $P_q(q)$ are the language models for answer sentences and question sentences, respectively.
We describe the proposed algorithm in this subsection. Overall, the framework includes three components, namely a QA model, a QG model and a regularization term that reflects the duality of QA and QG. Accordingly, the training objective of our framework includes three parts, which is described in Algorithm 1.
The QA specific objective aims to minimize the loss function $l_{qa}(f_{qa}(a,q;\theta _{qa}), label)$ , where $label$ is 0 or 1 that indicates whether $a$ is the correct answer of $q$ or not. Since the goal of a QA model is to predict whether a question-answer pair is correct or not, it is necessary to use negative QA pairs whose labels are zero. The details about the QA model will be presented in the next section.
For each correct question-answer pair, the QG specific objective is to minimize the following loss function,
$$l_{qg}(q, a) = -log P_{qg}(q|a;\theta _{qg})$$ (Eq. 6)
where $a$ is the correct answer of $q$ . The negative QA pairs are not necessary because the goal of a QG model is to generate the correct question for an answer. The QG model will be described in the following section.
The third objective is the regularization term which satisfies the probabilistic duality constrains as given in Equation 3 . Specifically, given a correct $\langle q, a \rangle $ pair, we would like to minimize the following loss function,
$$ \nonumber l_{dual}(a,q;\theta _{qa}, \theta _{qg}) &= [logP_a(a) + log P(q|a;\theta _{qg}) \\ & - logP_q(q) - logP(a|q;\theta _{qa})]^2$$ (Eq. 9)
where $P_a(a)$ and $P_q(q)$ are marginal distributions, which could be easily obtained through language model. $P(a|q;\theta _{qg})$ could also be easily calculated with the markov chain rule: $P(q|a;\theta _{qg}) = \prod _{t=1}^{|q|} P(q_t|q_{<t}, a;\theta _{qg})$ , where the function $P(q_t|q_{<t}, a;\theta _{qg})$ is the same with the decoder of the QG model (detailed in the following section).",Uses the probabilistic correlation between QA and QG as a regularization term to influence their training.,0.3111111065283951,0.0888888844444446,0.2666666620839507,4.739796546500556,33.766043295915395,31.369794783228468,0.1966490299823633,0.0056818181818181,0.542375922203064,0.6997750843601191,0.5926217436790466,0.5138758420944214

For the 2019 Workshop on Neural Generation of Text (WNGT) Efficiency shared task BIBREF0, the Notre Dame Natural Language Processing (NDNLP) group looked at a method of inducing sparsity in parameters called auto-sizing in order to reduce the number of parameters in the Transformer at the cost of a relatively minimal drop in performance.",Efficiency shared task.,0.2352941147404844,0.0,0.2352941147404844,3.458592114102736,34.794333396023006,32.16238101845093,0.1079136690647482,0.0023023791250959,0.5458052754402161,0.811542843069349,0.5458051562309265,0.8007200956344604
398,Was any variation in results observed based on language typology?,It is observed some variability - but not significant. Bert does not seem to gain much more syntax information than with type level information.,"On another note, we apply our formalization to evaluate multilingual $\textsc {bert} $'s syntax knowledge on a set of six typologically diverse languages. Although it does encode a large amount of information about syntax (more than $81\%$ in all languages), it only encodes at most $5\%$ more information than some trivial baseline knowledge (a type-level representation). This indicates that the task of POS labeling (word-level POS tagging) is not an ideal task for contemplating the syntactic understanding of contextual word embeddings.
We know $\textsc {bert} $ can generate text in many languages, here we assess how much does it actually know about syntax in those languages. And how much more does it know than simple type-level baselines. tab:results-full presents this results, showing how much information $\textsc {bert} $, fastText and onehot embeddings encode about POS tagging. We see that—in all analysed languages—type level embeddings can already capture most of the uncertainty in POS tagging. We also see that BERT only shares a small amount of extra information with the task, having small (or even negative) gains in all languages.
Finally, when put into perspective, multilingual $\textsc {bert} $'s representations do not seem to encode much more information about syntax than a trivial baseline. $\textsc {bert} $ only improves upon fastText in three of the six analysed languages—and even in those, it encodes at most (in English) $5\%$ additional information.",No.,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.444580998177086,2.506265664160401,4.626728814854435,0.0211864406779661,0.0004164931278633,0.0912895128130912,0.2255496680736541,0.1114115118980407,
399,Can the approach be generalized to other technical domains as well? ,"There is no reason to think that this approach wouldn't also be successful for other technical domains. Technical terms are replaced with tokens, therefore so as long as there is a corresponding process for identifying and replacing technical terms in the new domain this approach could be viable.","FLOAT SELECTED: Figure 2: NMT training after replacing technical term pairs with technical term tokens “TTi” (i = 1, 2, . . .)
FLOAT SELECTED: Figure 3: NMT decoding with technical term tokens “TTi” (i = 1, 2, . . .) and SMT technical term translation
FLOAT SELECTED: Figure 4: NMT rescoring of 1,000-best SMT translations with technical term tokens “TTi” (i = 1, 2, . . .)
In this paper, we propose a method that enables NMT to translate patent sentences with a large vocabulary of technical terms. We use an NMT model similar to that used by Sutskever et al. Sutskever14, which uses a deep long short-term memories (LSTM) BIBREF7 to encode the input sentence and a separate deep LSTM to output the translation. We train the NMT model on a bilingual corpus in which the technical terms are replaced with technical term tokens; this allows it to translate most of the source sentences except technical terms. Similar to Sutskever et al. Sutskever14, we use it as a decoder to translate source sentences with technical term tokens and replace the tokens with technical term translations using statistical machine translation (SMT). We also use it to rerank the 1,000-best SMT translations on the basis of the average of the SMT and NMT scores of the translated sentences that have been rescored with the technical term tokens. Our experiments on Japanese-Chinese patent sentences show that our proposed NMT system achieves a substantial improvement of up to 3.1 BLEU points and 2.3 RIBES points over a traditional SMT system and an improvement of approximately 0.6 BLEU points and 0.8 RIBES points over an equivalent NMT system without our proposed technique.
One important difference between our NMT model and the one used by Sutskever et al. Sutskever14 is that we added an attention mechanism. Recently, Bahdanau et al. Bahdanau15 proposed an attention mechanism, a form of random access memory, to help NMT cope with long input sequences. Luong et al. Luong15b proposed an attention mechanism for different scoring functions in order to compare the source and target hidden states as well as different strategies for placing the attention. In this paper, we utilize the attention mechanism proposed by Bahdanau et al. Bahdanau15, wherein each output target word is predicted on the basis of not only a recurrent hidden state and the previously predicted word but also a context vector computed as the weighted sum of the hidden states.
According to the approach proposed by Dong et al. Dong15b, we identify Japanese-Chinese technical term pairs using an SMT phrase translation table. Given a parallel sentence pair $\langle S_J, S_C\rangle $ containing a Japanese technical term $t_J$ , the Chinese translation candidates collected from the phrase translation table are matched against the Chinese sentence $S_C$ of the parallel sentence pair. Of those found in $S_C$ , $t_C$ with the largest translation probability $P(t_C\mid t_J)$ is selected, and the bilingual technical term pair $\langle t_J,t_C\rangle $ is identified.
For the Japanese technical terms whose Chinese translations are not included in the results of Step UID11 , we then use an approach based on SMT word alignment. Given a parallel sentence pair $\langle S_J, S_C\rangle $ containing a Japanese technical term $t_J$ , a sequence of Chinese words is selected using SMT word alignment, and we use the Chinese translation $t_C$ for the Japanese technical term $t_J$ .
Figure 3 illustrates the procedure for producing Chinese translations via decoding the Japanese sentence using the method proposed in this paper. In the step 1 of Figure 3 , when given an input Japanese sentence, we first automatically extract the technical terms and replace them with the technical term tokens “ $TT_{i}$ ” ( $i=1,2,\ldots $ ). Consequently, we have an input sentence in which the technical term tokens “ $TT_{i}$ ” ( $i=1,2,\ldots $ ) represent the positions of the technical terms and a list of extracted Japanese technical terms. Next, as shown in the step 2-N of Figure 3 , the source Japanese sentence with technical term tokens is translated using the NMT model trained according to the procedure described in Section ""NMT Training after Replacing Technical Term Pairs with Tokens"" , whereas the extracted Japanese technical terms are translated using an SMT phrase translation table in the step 2-S of Figure 3 . Finally, in the step 3, we replace the technical term tokens “ $TT_{i}$ ” ( $i=1,2,\ldots $ ) of the sentence translation with SMT the technical term translations.",yes.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7144315612998046,2.840201456856277,3.3655176663358364,0.0106382978723404,0.0002082899395959,0.0738806948065757,0.3478716611862182,0.0792685002088546,

In natural language processing (NLP), taking into account the morphological complexity inherent to each language could be important for improving or adapting the existing methods, since the amount of semantic and grammatical information encoded at the word level, may vary significantly from language to language.
Additionally, most of the previous works do not analyze how the complexity changes when different types of morphological normalization procedures are applied to a language, e.g., lemmatization, stemming, morphological segmentation. This information could be useful for linguistic analysis and for measuring the impact of different word form normalization tools depending of the language.

406,What's the method used here?,Two neural networks: an extractor based on an encoder (BERT) and a decoder (LSTM Pointer Network BIBREF22) and an abstractor identical to the one proposed in BIBREF8.,"Our model consists of two neural network modules, i.e. an extractor and abstractor. The extractor encodes a source document and chooses sentences from the document, and then the abstractor paraphrases the summary candidates. Formally, a single document consists of $n$ sentences $D=\lbrace s_1,s_2,\cdots ,s_n\rbrace $. We denote $i$-th sentence as $s_i=\lbrace w_{i1},w_{i2},\cdots ,w_{im}\rbrace $ where $w_{ij}$ is the $j$-th word in $s_i$. The extractor learns to pick out a subset of $D$ denoted as $\hat{D}=\lbrace \hat{s}_1,\hat{s}_2,\cdots ,\hat{s}_k|\hat{s}_i\in D\rbrace $ where $k$ sentences are selected. The abstractor rewrites each of the selected sentences to form a summary $S=\lbrace f(\hat{s}_1),f(\hat{s}_2),\cdots ,f(\hat{s}_k)\rbrace $, where $f$ is an abstracting function. And a gold summary consists of $l$ sentences $A=\lbrace a_1,a_2,\cdots ,a_l\rbrace $.
The extractor is based on the encoder-decoder framework. We adapt BERT for the encoder to exploit contextualized representations from pre-trained transformers. BERT as the encoder maps the input sequence $D$ to sentence representation vectors $H=\lbrace h_1,h_2,\cdots ,h_n\rbrace $, where $h_i$ is for the $i$-th sentence in the document. Then, the decoder utilizes $H$ to extract $\hat{D}$ from $D$.
We use LSTM Pointer Network BIBREF22 as the decoder to select the extracted sentences based on the above sentence representations. The decoder extracts sentences recurrently, producing a distribution over all of the remaining sentence representations excluding those already selected. Since we use the sequential model which selects one sentence at a time step, our decoder can consider the previously selected sentences. This property is needed to avoid selecting sentences that have overlapping information with the sentences extracted already.
The abstractor network approximates $f$, which compresses and paraphrases an extracted document sentence to a concise summary sentence. We use the standard attention based sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model BIBREF23, BIBREF24 with the copying mechanism BIBREF25 for handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Our abstractor is practically identical to the one proposed in BIBREF8.","Encoder-decoder framework with BERT and LSTM Pointer Network for extractor, and attention-based seq2seq model for abstractor.",0.2105263111357342,0.0487804831647833,0.2105263111357342,5.502042119161771,46.09568763352539,40.75247553847195,0.2184989222026259,0.0066225165562913,0.6925710439682007,0.6393005352836472,0.6925709843635559,0.6057152152061462
407,By how much does their method outperform state-of-the-art OOD detection?,"AE-HCN outperforms by 17%, AE-HCN-CNN outperforms by 20% on average.","The goal of this paper is to propose a novel OOD detection method that does not require OOD data by utilizing counterfeit OOD turns in the context of a dialog. Most prior approaches do not consider dialog context and make predictions for each utterance independently. We will show that this independent decision leads to suboptimal performance even when actual OOD utterances are given to optimize the model and that the use of dialog context helps reduce OOD detection errors. To consider dialog context, we need to connect the OOD detection task with the overall dialog task. Thus, for this work, we build upon Hybrid Code Networks (HCN) BIBREF4 since HCNs achieve state-of-the-art performance in a data-efficient way for task-oriented dialogs, and propose AE-HCNs which extend HCNs with an autoencoder (Figure FIGREF8 ). Furthermore, we release new dialog datasets which are three publicly available dialog corpora augmented with OOD turns in a controlled way (exemplified in Table TABREF2 ) to foster further research.
The result is shown in Table TABREF23 . Since there are multiple actions that are appropriate for a given dialog context, we use per-utterance Precision@K as performance metric. We also report f1-score for OOD detection to measure the balance between precision and recall. The performances of HCN on Test-OOD are about 15 points down on average from those on Test, showing the detrimental impact of OOD utterances to such models only trained on in-domain training data. AE-HCN(-CNN) outperforms HCN on Test-OOD by a large margin about 17(20) points on average while keeping the minimum performance trade-off compared to Test. Interestingly, AE-HCN-CNN has even better performance than HCN on Test, indicating that, with the CNN encoder, counterfeit OOD augmentation acts as an effective regularization. In contrast, AE-HCN-Indep failed to robustly detect OOD utterances, resulting in much lower numbers for both metrics on Test-OOD as well as hurting the performance on Test. This result indicates two crucial points: 1) the inherent difficulty of finding an appropriate threshold value without actually seeing OOD data; 2) the limitation of the models which do not consider context. For the first point, Figure FIGREF24 plots histograms of reconstruction scores for IND and OOD utterances of bAbI6 Test-OOD. If OOD utterances had been known a priori, the threshold should have been set to a much higher value than the maximum reconstruction score of IND training data (6.16 in this case).",17(20) points on average.,0.3333333288888889,0.1818181778512397,0.3333333288888889,12.011055432195764,33.32349269785425,34.05497373611079,0.3328358208955224,0.0049751243781094,0.1533716022968292,0.2371668534825987,0.153371587395668,
408,What are dilated convolutions?,Similar to standard convolutional networks but instead they skip some input values effectively operating on a broader scale.,"In this work we focus on end-to-end stateless temporal modeling which can take advantage of a large context while limiting computation and avoiding saturation issues. By end-to-end model, we mean a straight-forward model with a binary target that does not require a precise phoneme alignment beforehand. We explore an architecture based on a stack of dilated convolution layers, effectively operating on a broader scale than with standard convolutions while limiting model size. We further improve our solution with gated activations and residual skip-connections, inspired by the WaveNet style architecture explored previously for text-to-speech applications BIBREF10 and voice activity detection BIBREF9 , but never applied to KWS to our knowledge. In BIBREF11 , the authors explore Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) for KWS. ResNets differ from WaveNet models in that they do not leverage skip-connections and gating, and apply convolution kernels in the frequency domain, drastically increasing the computational cost.
Standard convolutional networks cannot capture long temporal patterns with reasonably small models due to the increase in computational cost yielded by larger receptive fields. Dilated convolutions skip some input values so that the convolution kernel is applied over a larger area than its own. The network therefore operates on a larger scale, without the downside of increasing the number of parameters. The receptive field $r$ of a network made of stacked convolutions indeed reads: $r = \sum _i d_i (s_i - 1),$",Dilated convolutions skip some input values so that the convolution kernel is applied over a larger area than its own.,0.2631578897506926,0.1666666616820989,0.2631578897506926,12.624426670185636,41.083558447203664,36.392139883344186,0.3305697278911564,0.0116279069767441,0.4075908362865448,0.5941054123453797,0.4075908064842224,0.5726183652877808

For instance, BIBREF8 trained a series of bigram language models to quantify the violation of social norms in users' posts on an online community by leveraging cross-entropy value, or the deviation of word sequences predicted by the language model and their usage by the user. However, their models were trained on written-language instead of natural face-face dialog corpus. Another kind of social norm violation was examined by BIBREF10 , who developed a classifier to identify specific types of sarcasm in tweets. They utilized a bootstrapping algorithm to automatically extract lists of positive sentiment phrases and negative situation phrases from given sarcastic tweets, which were in turn leveraged to recognize sarcasm in an SVM classifier. However, no contextual information was considered in this work. BIBREF11 understood the nature of social norm violation in dialog by correlating it with associated observable verbal, vocal and visual cues. By leveraging their findings and statistical machine learning techniques, they built a computational model for automatic recognition.

Subreddits are sub-communities on Reddit oriented around specific interests or topics, such as technology or politics.

425,What experiments are proposed to test that upper layers produce context-specific embeddings?,"They plot the average cosine similarity between uniformly random words increases exponentially from layers 8 through 12.  
They plot the average self-similarity of uniformly randomly sampled words in each layer of BERT, ELMo, and GPT-2 and shown that the higher layer produces more context-specific embeddings.
They plot that word representations in a sentence become more context-specific in upper layers, they drift away from one another.","Recall from Definition 1 that the self-similarity of a word, in a given layer of a given model, is the average cosine similarity between its representations in different contexts, adjusted for anisotropy. If the self-similarity is 1, then the representations are not context-specific at all; if the self-similarity is 0, that the representations are maximally context-specific. In Figure FIGREF24, we plot the average self-similarity of uniformly randomly sampled words in each layer of BERT, ELMo, and GPT-2. For example, the self-similarity is 1.0 in ELMo's input layer because representations in that layer are static character-level embeddings.
In all three models, the higher the layer, the lower the self-similarity is on average. In other words, the higher the layer, the more context-specific the contextualized representations. This finding makes intuitive sense. In image classification models, lower layers recognize more generic features such as edges while upper layers recognize more class-specific features BIBREF19. Similarly, upper layers of LSTMs trained on NLP tasks learn more task-specific representations BIBREF4. Therefore, it follows that upper layers of neural language models learn more context-specific representations, so as to predict the next word for a given context more accurately. Of all three models, representations in GPT-2 are the most context-specific, with those in GPT-2's last layer being almost maximally context-specific.
As seen in Figure FIGREF20, for GPT-2, the average cosine similarity between uniformly randomly words is roughly 0.6 in layers 2 through 8 but increases exponentially from layers 8 through 12. In fact, word representations in GPT-2's last layer are so anisotropic that any two words have on average an almost perfect cosine similarity! This pattern holds for BERT and ELMo as well, though there are exceptions: for example, the anisotropy in BERT's penultimate layer is much higher than in its final layer.
As word representations in a sentence become more context-specific in upper layers, they drift away from one another, although there are exceptions (see layer 12 in Figure FIGREF25). However, in all layers, the average similarity between words in the same sentence is still greater than the average similarity between randomly chosen words (i.e., the anisotropy baseline). This suggests a more nuanced contextualization than in ELMo, with BERT recognizing that although the surrounding sentence informs a word's meaning, two words in the same sentence do not necessarily have a similar meaning because they share the same context.",None are explicitly proposed.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5087757562008263,8.953491701284019,7.402077439060998,0.015527950310559,0.0006150061500615,0.0775543898344039,0.4422481055347083,0.0902481228113174,0.2987218499183655

428,Which methods are considered to find examples of biases and unwarranted inferences??,"Looking for adjectives marking the noun ""baby"" and also looking for most-common adjectives related to certain nouns using POS-tagging.","We don't know whether or not an entity belongs to a particular social class (in this case: ethnic group) until it is marked as such. But we can approximate the proportion by looking at all the images where the annotators have used a marker (in this case: adjectives like black, white, asian), and for those images count how many descriptions (out of five) contain a marker. This gives us an upper bound that tells us how often ethnicity is indicated by the annotators. Note that this upper bound lies somewhere between 20% (one description) and 100% (5 descriptions). Figure TABREF22 presents count data for the ethnic marking of babies. It includes two false positives (talking about a white baby stroller rather than a white baby). In the Asian group there is an additional complication: sometimes the mother gets marked rather than the baby. E.g. An Asian woman holds a baby girl. I have counted these occurrences as well.
One interesting pattern is that the ethnicity/race of babies doesn't seem to be mentioned unless the baby is black or asian. In other words: white seems to be the default, and others seem to be marked. How can we tell whether or not the data is actually biased?
It may be difficult to spot patterns by just looking at a collection of images. Another method is to tag all descriptions with part-of-speech information, so that it becomes possible to see e.g. which adjectives are most commonly used for particular nouns. One method readers may find particularly useful is to leverage the structure of Flickr30K Entities BIBREF8 . This dataset enriches Flickr30K by adding coreference annotations, i.e. which phrase in each description refers to the same entity in the corresponding image. I have used this data to create a coreference graph by linking all phrases that refer to the same entity. Following this, I applied Louvain clustering BIBREF9 to the coreference graph, resulting in clusters of expressions that refer to similar entities. Looking at those clusters helps to get a sense of the enormous variation in referring expressions.

429,How was this data collected?,"The crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower was used to obtain natural dialog data that prompted the user to paraphrase, explain, and/or answer a question from a Simple questions BIBREF7 dataset. The CrowdFlower users were restricted to English-speaking countries to avoid dialogs  with poor English.","However, getting access to systems with real users is usually hard. Therefore, we used the crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower (CF) for our data collection.
A CF worker gets a task instructing them to use our chat-like interface to help the system with a question which is randomly selected from training examples of Simple questions BIBREF7 dataset. To complete the task user has to communicate with the system through the three phase dialog discussing question paraphrase (see Section ""Interactive Learning Evaluation"" ), explanation (see Section ""Future Work"" ) and answer of the question (see Section ""Conclusion"" ). To avoid poor English level of dialogs we involved CF workers from English speaking countries only.

430,How does the IPA label data after interacting with users?,It defined a sequence labeling task to extract custom entities from user input and label the next action (out of 13  custom actions defined).,"Named Entity Recognition: We defined a sequence labeling task to extract custom entities from user input. We assumed seven (7) possible entities (see Table TABREF43) to be recognized by the model: topic, subtopic, examination mode and level, question number, intent, as well as the entity other for remaining words in the utterance. Since the data obtained from the rule-based system already contains information on the entities extracted from each user query (i.e., by means of Elasticsearch), we could use it to train a domain-specific NER unit. However, since the user-input was informal, the same information could be provided in different writing styles. That means that a single entity could have different surface forms (e.g., synonyms, writing styles) (although entities that we extracted from the rule-based system were all converted to a universal standard, e.g., official chapter names). To consider all of the variable entity forms while post-labeling the original dataset, we defined generic entity names (e.g., chapter, question nr.) and mapped variations of entities from the user input (e.g., Chapter = [Elementary Calculus, Chapter $I$, ...]) to them.
Next Action Prediction: We defined a classification problem to predict the system's next action according to the given user input. We assumed 13 custom actions (see Table TABREF42) that we considered being our labels. In the conversational dataset, each input was automatically labeled by the rule-based system with the corresponding next action and the dialogue-id. Thus, no additional post-labeling was required.

431,How was the audio data gathered?,Through the All India Radio new channel where actors read news.,"In this paper, we explore multiple pooling strategies for language identification task. Mainly we propose Ghost-VLAD based pooling method for language identification. Inspired by the recent work by W. Xie et al. [9] and Y. Zhong et al. [10], we use Ghost-VLAD to improve the accuracy of language identification task for Indian languages. We explore multiple pooling strategies including NetVLAD pooling [11], Average pooling and Statistics pooling( as proposed in X-vectors [7]) and show that Ghost-VLAD pooling is the best pooling strategy for language identification. Our model obtains the best accuracy of 98.24%, and it outperforms all the other previously proposed pooling methods. We conduct all our experiments on 635hrs of audio data for 7 Indian languages collected from $\textbf {All India Radio}$ news channel. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we explain the proposed pooling method for language identification. In section 3, we explain our dataset. In section 4, we describe the experiments, and in section 5, we describe the results.
In this section, we describe our dataset collection process. We collected and curated around 635Hrs of audio data for 7 Indian languages, namely Kannada, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, and English. We collected the data from the All India Radio news channel where an actor will be reading news for about 5-10 mins. To cover many speakers for the dataset, we crawled data from 2010 to 2019. Since the audio is very long to train any deep neural network directly, we segment the audio clips into smaller chunks using Voice activity detector. Since the audio clips will have music embedded during the news, we use Inhouse music detection model to remove the music segments from the dataset to make the dataset clean and our dataset contains 635Hrs of clean audio which is divided into 520Hrs of training data containing 165K utterances and 115Hrs of testing data containing 35K utterances.

432,What is the GhostVLAD approach?,An extension of NetVLAD which replaces hard assignment-based clustering with soft assignment-based clustering with the additon o fusing Ghost clusters to deal with noisy content.,"GhostVLAD is an extension of the NetVLAD approach, which we discussed in the previous section. The GhostVLAD model was proposed for face recognition by Y. Zhong [10]. GhostVLAD works exactly similar to NetVLAD except it adds Ghost clusters along with the NetVLAD clusters. So, now we will have a K+G number of clusters instead of K clusters. Where G is the number of ghost clusters, we want to add (typically 2-4). The Ghost clusters are added to map any noisy or irrelevant content into ghost clusters and are not included during the feature aggregation stage, as shown in Figure 1 (Right side). Which means that we compute the matrix V for both normal cluster K and ghost clusters G, but we will not include the vectors belongs to ghost cluster from V during concatenation of the features. Due to which, during feature aggregation stage the contribution of the noisy and unwanted features to normal VLAD clusters are assigned less weights while Ghost clusters absorb most of the weight. We illustrate this in Figure 1(Right Side), where the ghost clusters are shown in red color. We use Ghost clusters when we are computing the V matrix, but they are excluded during the concatenation stage. These concatenated features are fed into the projection layer, followed by softmax to predict the language label.
The NetVLAD pooling strategy was initially developed for place recognition by R. Arandjelovic et al. [11]. The NetVLAD is an extension to VLAD [18] approach where they were able to replace the hard assignment based clustering with soft assignment based clustering so that it can be trained with neural network in an end to end fashion. In our case, we use the NetVLAD layer to map N local features of dimension D into a fixed dimensional vector, as shown in Figure 1 (Left side).",An extension of NetVLAD with ghost clusters to map noisy content.,0.5624999954882813,0.312499995703125,0.5624999954882813,14.965975078050626,58.81396009820544,58.17209902272323,0.4364039508163677,0.0072799470549305,0.7302590608596802,0.7841504000507675,0.730259120464325,0.8506726622581482

440,How much better than the baseline is LiLi?,"In case of Freebase knowledge base, LiLi model had better F1 score than the single model by 0.20 , 0.01, 0.159 for kwn, unk, and all test Rel type.  The values for WordNet are 0.25, 0.1, 0.2.","Baselines. As none of the existing KBC methods can solve the OKBC problem, we choose various versions of LiLi as baselines.
Single: Version of LiLi where we train a single prediction model INLINEFORM0 for all test relations.
Sep: We do not transfer (past learned) weights for initializing INLINEFORM0 , i.e., we disable LL.
F-th): Here, we use a fixed prediction threshold 0.5 instead of relation-specific threshold INLINEFORM0 .
BG: The missing or connecting links (when the user does not respond) are filled with “@-RelatedTo-@"" blindly, no guessing mechanism.
w/o PTS: LiLi does not ask for additional clues via past task selection for skillset improvement.
Evaluation-I: Strategy Formulation Ability. Table 5 shows the list of inference strategies formulated by LiLi for various INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 , which control the strategy formulation of LiLi. When INLINEFORM2 , LiLi cannot interact with user and works like a closed-world method. Thus, INLINEFORM3 drops significantly (0.47). When INLINEFORM4 , i.e. with only one interaction per query, LiLi acquires knowledge well for instances where either of the entities or relation is unknown. However, as one unknown entity may appear in multiple test triples, once the entity becomes known, LiLi doesn’t need to ask for it again and can perform inference on future triples causing significant increase in INLINEFORM5 (0.97). When INLINEFORM6 , LiLi is able to perform inference on all instances and INLINEFORM7 becomes 1. For INLINEFORM8 , LiLi uses INLINEFORM9 only once (as only one MLQ satisfies INLINEFORM10 ) compared to INLINEFORM11 . In summary, LiLi’s RL-model can effectively formulate query-specific inference strategies (based on specified parameter values). Evaluation-II: Predictive Performance. Table 6 shows the comparative performance of LiLi with baselines. To judge the overall improvements, we performed paired t-test considering +ve F1 scores on each relation as paired data. Considering both KBs and all relation types, LiLi outperforms Sep with INLINEFORM12 . If we set INLINEFORM13 (training with very few clues), LiLi outperforms Sep with INLINEFORM14 on Freebase considering MCC. Thus, the lifelong learning mechanism is effective in transferring helpful knowledge. Single model performs better than Sep for unknown relations due to the sharing of knowledge (weights) across tasks. However, for known relations, performance drops because, as a new relation arrives to the system, old weights get corrupted and catastrophic forgetting occurs. For unknown relations, as the relations are evaluated just after training, there is no chance for catastrophic forgetting. The performance improvement ( INLINEFORM15 ) of LiLi over F-th on Freebase signifies that the relation-specific threshold INLINEFORM16 works better than fixed threshold 0.5 because, if all prediction values for test instances lie above (or below) 0.5, F-th predicts all instances as +ve (-ve) which degrades its performance. Due to the utilization of contextual similarity (highly correlated with class labels) of entity-pairs, LiLi’s guessing mechanism works better ( INLINEFORM17 ) than blind guessing (BG). The past task selection mechanism of LiLi also improves its performance over w/o PTS, as it acquires more clues during testing for poorly performed tasks (evaluated on validation set). For Freebase, due to a large number of past tasks [9 (25% of 38)], the performance difference is more significant ( INLINEFORM18 ). For WordNet, the number is relatively small [3 (25% of 14)] and hence, the difference is not significant.

441,What are the components of the general knowledge learning engine?,"Answer with content missing: (list)
LiLi should have the following capabilities:
1. to formulate an inference strategy for a given query that embeds processing and interactive actions.
2. to learn interaction behaviors (deciding what to ask and when to ask the user).
3. to leverage the acquired knowledge in the current and future inference process.
4. to perform 1, 2 and 3 in a lifelong manner for continuous knowledge learning.","We solve the OKBC problem by mimicking how humans acquire knowledge and perform reasoning in an interactive conversation. Whenever we encounter an unknown concept or relation while answering a query, we perform inference using our existing knowledge. If our knowledge does not allow us to draw a conclusion, we typically ask questions to others to acquire related knowledge and use it in inference. The process typically involves an inference strategy (a sequence of actions), which interleaves a sequence of processing and interactive actions. A processing action can be the selection of related facts, deriving inference chain, etc., that advances the inference process. An interactive action can be deciding what to ask, formulating a suitable question, etc., that enable us to interact. The process helps grow the knowledge over time and the gained knowledge enables us to communicate better in the future. We call this lifelong interactive learning and inference (LiLi). Lifelong learning is reflected by the facts that the newly acquired facts are retained in the KB and used in inference for future queries, and that the accumulated knowledge in addition to the updated KB including past inference performances are leveraged to guide future interaction and learning.

The dataset contains 4 different domains: Book (B), DVDs (D), Electronics (E), and Kitchen (K). Following their experimental settings, we consider the binary classification task to predict whether a review is positive or negative on the target domain. Each domain consists of 1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews respectively. We also allow 4000 unlabeled reviews to be used for both the source and the target domains, of which the positive and negative reviews are balanced as well, following the settings in previous works. We construct 12 cross-domain sentiment classification tasks and split the labeled data in each domain into a training set of 1600 reviews and a test set of 400 reviews. The classifier is trained on the training set of the source domain and is evaluated on the test set of the target domain.

444,How do they deal with unknown distribution senses?,The Näive-Bayes classifier is corrected so it is not biased to most frequent classes.,"Monosemous relatives have been employed multiple times (see Section 2), but results remain unsatisfactory. The aim of my study is to explore the limitations of this technique by implementing and evaluating such a tool for Polish. Firstly, the method is expanded by waiving the requirement of monosemy and proposing several new sources of relatives. These previously unexplored sources are based on wordnet data and help gather many training cases from the corpus. Secondly, a well-known problem of uneven yet unknown distribution of word senses is alleviated by modifying a naïve Bayesian classifier. Thanks to this correction, the classifier is no longer biased towards senses that have more training data. Finally, a very large corpus (600 million documents), gathered from the web by a Polish search engine NEKST, is used to build models based on training corpora of different sizes. Those experiments show what amount of data is sufficient for such a task. The proposed solution is compared to baselines that use wordnet structure only, with no training corpora.
The algorithm works as follows. First, a set of relatives is obtained for each sense of a target word using the Polish wordnet: plWordNet BIBREF18 . Some of the replacements may have multiple senses, however usually one of them covers most cases. Secondly, a set of context features is extracted from occurrences of relatives in the NEKST corpus. Finally, the aggregated feature values corresponding to target word senses are used to build a naïve Bayesian classifier adjusted to a situation of unknown a priori probabilities.",By modifying a naïve Bayesian classifier to alleviate the problem of uneven yet unknown distribution of word senses.,0.1333333284222224,0.0,0.1333333284222224,2.6490337110357856,22.710995266129792,19.095484228334826,0.1298701298701298,0.0104772991850989,0.3955157697200775,0.4263437597207653,0.3955157101154327,0.5692148804664612
445,What conclusions do the authors draw from their finding that the emotional appeal of ISIS and Catholic materials are similar?,"By comparing scores for each word calculated using Depechemood dictionary and normalize emotional score for each article, they found Catholic and ISIS materials show similar scores.","We rely on Depechemood dictionaries to analyze emotions in both corpora. These dictionaries are freely available and come in multiple arrangements. We used a version that includes words with their part of speech (POS) tags. Only words that exist in the Depechemood dictionary with the same POS tag are considered for our analysis. We aggregated the score for each word and normalized each article by emotions. To better compare the result, we added a baseline of 100 random articles from a Reuters news dataset as a non-religious general resource which is available in an NLTK python library. Figure FIGREF22 shows the aggregated score for different feelings in our corpora.
Both Catholic and ISIS related materials score the highest in “inspired” category. Furthermore, in both cases, being afraid has the lowest score. However, this is not the case for random news material such as the Reuters corpus, which are not that inspiring and, according to this method, seems to cause more fear in their audience. We investigate these results further by looking at the most inspiring words detected in these two corpora. Table TABREF24 presents 10 words that are among the most inspiring in both corpora. The comparison of the two lists indicate that the method picks very different words in each corpus to reach to the same conclusion. Also, we looked at separate articles in each of the issues of ISIS material addressing women. Figure FIGREF23 shows emotion scores in each of the 20 issues of ISIS propaganda. As demonstrated, in every separate article, this method gives the highest score to evoking inspirations in the reader. Also, in most of these issues the method scored “being afraid” as the lowest score in each issue.
Comparing these topics with those that appeared on a Catholic women forum, it seems that both ISIS and non-violent groups use topics about motherhood, spousal relationship, and marriage/divorce when they address women. Moreover, we used Depechemood methods to analyze the emotions that these materials are likely to elicit in readers. The result of our emotion analysis suggests that both corpuses used words that aim to inspire readers while avoiding fear. However, the actual words that lead to these effects are very different in the two contexts. Overall, our findings indicate that, using proper methods, automated analysis of large bodies of textual data can provide novel insight insight into extremist propaganda that can assist the counterterrorism community.","The authors conclude that both ISIS and non-violent groups use similar topics (motherhood, spousal relationship, and marriage/divorce) when addressing women, and both aim to inspire readers while avoiding fear.",0.1249999950347224,0.0,0.0416666617013894,1.515442198028239,23.949217733157106,20.24895306014952,0.1219512195121951,0.0102509720749381,0.392046719789505,0.4784767207900497,0.3920466303825378,0.458256185054779
446,How id Depechemood trained?,By multiplying crowd-annotated document-emotion matrix with emotion-word matrix.,"Depechemood is a lexicon-based emotion detection method gathered from crowd-annotated news BIBREF24. Drawing on approximately 23.5K documents with average of 500 words per document from rappler.com, researchers asked subjects to report their emotions after reading each article. They then multiplied the document-emotion matrix and word-document matrix to derive emotion-word matrix for these words. Due to limitations of their experiment setup, the emotion categories that they present does not exactly match the emotions from the Plutchik wheel categories. However, they still provide a good sense of the general feeling of an individual after reading an article. The emotion categories of Depechemood are: AFRAID, AMUSED, ANGRY, ANNOYED, DON'T CARE, HAPPY, INSPIRED, SAD. Depechemood simply creates dictionaries of words where each word has scores between 0 and 1 for all of these 8 emotion categories.

447,How are similarities and differences between the texts from violent and non-violent religious groups analyzed?,By using topic modeling and unsupervised emotion detection on ISIS materials and articles from Catholic women forum.,"What similarities and/or differences do these topics have with non-violent, non-Islamic religious material addressed specifically to women?
As these questions suggest, to understand what, if anything, makes extremist appeals distinctive, we need a point of comparison in terms of the outreach efforts to women from a mainstream, non-violent religious group. For this purpose, we rely on an online Catholic women's forum. Comparison between Catholic material and the content of ISIS' online magazines allows for novel insight into the distinctiveness of extremist rhetoric when targeted towards the female population. To accomplish this task, we employ topic modeling and an unsupervised emotion detection method.",Through topic modeling and unsupervised emotion detection.,0.5217391262003781,0.4545454505785124,0.5217391262003781,27.499775953224148,72.09817002106394,69.84941798762297,0.3733493397358943,0.0057995028997514,0.6755900979042053,0.8967391304347826,0.6755900382995605,0.8619881868362427
448,How are prominent topics idenified in Dabiq and Rumiyah?,Using NMF based topic modeling and their coherence prominent topics are identified.,"A comparison of common words suggests that those related to marital relationships ( husband, wife, etc.) appear in both corpora, but the religious theme of ISIS material appears to be stronger. A stronger comparison can be made using topic modeling techniques to discover main topics of these documents. Although we used LDA, our results by using NMF outperform LDA topics, due to the nature of these corpora. Also, fewer numbers of ISIS documents might contribute to the comparatively worse performance. Therefore, we present only NMF results. Based on their coherence, we selected 10 topics for analyzing within both corporas. Table TABREF18 and Table TABREF19 show the most important words in each topic with a general label that we assigned to the topic manually. Based on the NMF output, ISIS articles that address women include topics mainly about Islam, women's role in early Islam, hijrah (moving to another land), spousal relations, marriage, and motherhood.","Using NMF topic modeling techniques, selecting 10 coherent topics, and manually assigning general labels.",0.3846153796449704,0.166666661701389,0.3846153796449704,7.387561680614721,37.89103665741514,35.4646861109628,0.4710820895522388,0.0125673249551166,0.8489139080047607,0.6639510134927633,0.8489139080047607,0.6163756847381592

Out-of-scope queries were collected in two ways. First, using worker mistakes: queries written for one of the 150 intents that did not actually match any of the intents. Second, using scoping and scenario tasks with prompts based on topic areas found on Quora, Wikipedia, and elsewhere. To help ensure the richness of this additional out-of-scope data, each of these task prompts contributed to at most four queries.

460,Ngrams of which length are aligned using PARENT?,Answer with content missing: (Parent subsections) combine precisions for n-gram orders 1-4.,"We show that existing automatic metrics, including BLEU, correlate poorly with human judgments when the evaluation sets contain divergent references (§ SECREF36 ). For many table-to-text generation tasks, the tables themselves are in a pseudo-natural language format (e.g., WikiBio, WebNLG BIBREF6 , and E2E-NLG BIBREF10 ). In such cases we propose to compare the generated text to the underlying table as well to improve evaluation. We develop a new metric, PARENT (Precision And Recall of Entailed N-grams from the Table) (§ SECREF3 ). When computing precision, PARENT effectively uses a union of the reference and the table, to reward correct information missing from the reference. When computing recall, it uses an intersection of the reference and the table, to ignore extra incorrect information in the reference. The union and intersection are computed with the help of an entailment model to decide if a text n-gram is entailed by the table. We show that this method is more effective than using the table as an additional reference. Our main contributions are:

473,How do they combine a deep learning model with a knowledge base?,Entities from a deep learning model are linked to the related entities from a knowledge base by a lookup.,"While these knowledge bases provide semantically rich and fine-granular classes and relationship types, the task of entity classification often requires associating coarse-grained classes with discovered surface forms of entities. Most existing studies consider NER and entity linking as two separate tasks, whereas we try to combine the two. It has been shown that one can significantly increase the semantic information carried by a NER system when we successfully linking entities from a deep learning method to the related entities from a knowledge base BIBREF26 , BIBREF27 .
Redirection: For the Wikidata linking element, we recognize that the lookup will be constrained by the most common lookup name for each entity. Consider the utterance (referring to the NBA basketball player) from Figure FIGREF12 “Michael Jeffrey Jordan in San Jose” as an example. The lookup for this entity in Wikidata is “Michael Jordan” and consequently will not be picked up if we were to use an exact string match. A simple method to circumvent such a problem is the usage of a redirection list. Such a list is provided on an entity by entity basis in the “Also known as” section in Wikidata. Using this redirection list, when we do not find an exact string match improves the recall of our model by 5-10%. Moreover, with the example of Michael Jordan (person), using our current framework, we will always refer to the retired basketball player (Q41421). We will never, for instance, pick up Michael Jordan (Q27069141) the American football cornerback. Or in fact any other Michael Jordan, famous or otherwise. One possible method to overcome this is to add a disambiguation layer, which seeks to use context from earlier parts of the text. This is, however, work for future improvement and we only consider the most common version of that entity.",They link entities from a deep learning method to related entities from a knowledge base.,0.6428571379591838,0.4827586158382878,0.6428571379591838,37.51840463233444,77.44650818087723,73.35491807806856,0.6194033735943357,0.0147783251231527,0.8905611038208008,0.8345766322953361,0.8905609846115112,0.9885042309761048
474,What are the models used for the baseline of the three NLP tasks?,"For speech synthesis, they build a speech clustergen statistical speech synthesizer BIBREF9. For speech recognition, they use Kaldi BIBREF11. For Machine Translation, they use a Transformer architecture from BIBREF15.","We phonetically aligned this data and built a speech clustergen statistical speech synthesizer BIBREF9 from all of this data. We resynthesized all of the data and measured the difference between the synthesized data and the original data using Mel Cepstral Distortion, a standard method for automatically measuring quality of speech generation BIBREF10. We then ordered the segments by their generation score and took the top 2000 turns to build a new synthesizer, assuming the better scores corresponded to better alignments, following the techniques of BIBREF7.
For speech recognition (ASR) we used Kaldi BIBREF11. As we do not have access to pronunciation lexica for Mapudungun, we had to approximate them with two settings. In the first setting, we make the simple assumption that each character corresponds to a pronunced phoneme. In the second setting, we instead used the generated phonetic lexicon also used in the above-mentioned speech synthesis techniques. The train/dev/test splits are across conversations, as described above.

Analogies are solved using nearest neighbor lookups in the vector space, and so accounting for negative cooccurrence effectively repels words with which no positive cooccurrence was observed. In future work, we will explore incorporating $\mathit {\texttt {-}PMI}$ only for rare words (where it is most needed).",None mentioned.,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3864985683445354,17.046282196815277,15.389124729536624,0.045045045045045,0.0018148820326678,0.083720751106739,0.4819546739260356,0.0837207585573196,

Many models work around this issue by clipping negative $\mathit {PMI}$ values at 0, a measure known as Positive $\mathit {PMI}$ ($\mathit {PPMI}$), which works very well in practice. An unanswered question is: “What is lost/gained by collapsing the negative $\mathit {PMI}$ spectrum to 0?”.

Select:

In that work, the authors relate the surprisal of a word, i.e. the (negative log) probability of the word appearing in its context, to each of the ERP signals we consider here. The authors do not directly train a model to predict ERPs. Instead, models of the probability distribution of each word in context are used to compute a surprisal for each word, which is input into a mixed effects regression along with word frequency, word length, word position in the sentence, and sentence position in the experiment. The effect of the surprisal is assessed using a likelihood-ratio test. In BIBREF7 , the authors take an approach similar to BIBREF0 . The authors compare the explanatory power of surprisal (as computed by an LSTM or a Recurrent Neural Network Grammar (RNNG) language model) to a measure of syntactic complexity they call “distance"" that counts the number of parser actions in the RNNG language model. The authors find that surprisal (as predicted by the RNNG) and distance are both significant factors in a mixed effects regression which predicts the P600, while the surprisal as computed by an LSTM is not. Unlike BIBREF0 and BIBREF7 , we do not use a linking function (e.g. surprisal) to relate a language model to ERPs. We thus lose the interpretability provided by the linking function, but we are able to predict a significant proportion of the variance for all of the ERP components, where prior work could not. We interpret our results through characterization of the ERPs in terms of how they relate to each other and to eye-tracking data rather than through a linking function. The authors in BIBREF8 also use a recurrent neural network to predict neural activity directly. In that work the authors predict magnetoencephalography (MEG) activity, a close cousin to EEG, recorded while participants read a chapter of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone BIBREF9 . Their approach to characterization of processing at each MEG sensor location is to determine whether it is best predicted by the context vector of the recurrent network (prior to the current word being processed), the embedding of the current word, or the probability of the current word given the context. In future work we also intend to add these types of studies to the ERP predictions.

To this end, we introduce the negated LAMA dataset. We construct it by simply inserting negation elements (e.g., “not”) in LAMA cloze statement (e.g., “The theory of relativity was not developed by [MASK].”). In our experiments, we query the pretrained language models with both original LAMA and negated LAMA statements and compare their predictions in terms of rank correlation and overlap of top predictions. We find that the predicted filler words often have high overlap. Thus, negating a cloze statement does not change the predictions in many cases – but of course it should as our example “birds can fly” vs. “birds cannot fly” shows. We identify and analyze a subset of cloze statements where predictions are different. We find that BERT handles negation best among pretrained language models, but it still fails badly on most negated statements.","They inserted negation elements (e.g., ""not"") in LAMA cloze statements.",0.1379310296313913,0.0,0.1379310296313913,2.0705706652424007,28.930900424848804,24.17844877476632,0.0862068965517241,0.004524886877828,0.4230956137180328,0.5239371646975362,0.4230956137180328,0.320593923330307

492,What are the three steps to feature elimination?,"Reduced the dataset by eliminating features, apply feature selection to select highest ranked features to train and test the model and rank the performance of incrementally adding features.","Feature elimination strategies are often taken 1) to remove irrelevant or noisy features, 2) to improve classifier performance, and 3) to reduce training and run times. We conducted an experiment to determine whether we could maintain or improve classifier performances by applying the following three-tiered feature elimination approach:
Reduction We reduced the dataset encoded for each class by eliminating features that occur less than twice in the full dataset.
Selection We iteratively applied Chi-Square feature selection on the reduced dataset, selecting the top percentile of highest ranked features in increments of 5 percent to train and test the support vector model using a linear kernel and 5-fold, stratified cross-validation.
Rank We cumulatively plotted the average F1-score performances of each incrementally added percentile of top ranked features.

493,How is the dataset annotated?,The annotations are based on evidence of depression and further annotated by the depressive symptom if there is evidence of depression.,"Specifically, we conducted a feature ablation study to assess the informativeness of each feature group and a feature elimination study to determine the optimal feature sets for classifying Twitter tweets. We leveraged an existing, annotated Twitter dataset that was constructed based on a hierarchical model of depression-related symptoms BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . The dataset contains 9,473 annotations for 9,300 tweets. Each tweet is annotated as no evidence of depression (e.g., “Citizens fear an economic depression"") or evidence of depression (e.g., “depressed over disappointment""). If a tweet is annotated evidence of depression, then it is further annotated with one or more depressive symptoms, for example, depressed mood (e.g., “feeling down in the dumps""), disturbed sleep (e.g., “another restless night""), or fatigue or loss of energy (e.g., “the fatigue is unbearable"") BIBREF10 . For each class, every annotation (9,473 tweets) is binarized as the positive class e.g., depressed mood=1 or negative class e.g., not depressed mood=0.","Each tweet is annotated as no evidence of depression or evidence of depression, with further annotation of depressive symptoms if applicable.",0.4444444394444444,0.1081081031117606,0.3333333283333334,12.28749228144577,63.77231157277888,56.70181460224663,0.4340197617508542,0.0129549660703269,0.6648931503295898,0.8653800706298365,0.6648931503295898,0.9745835065841676

To reduce the computational time, we used hierarchical subsampling BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF10 . We applied subsampling on all the Bi-LSTM layers and reduced the length by a factor of 8.
On the decoder side, the previous input phonemes / characters were converted into real vectors by a 128-dimensional embedding matrix. We used one unidirectional LSTM with 512 hidden units and followed by a softmax layer to output the character probability. For the end-to-end training phase, we froze the parameter values from the transferred layers from epoch 0 to epoch 10, and after epoch 10 we jointly optimized all the parameters together until the end of training (a total 40 epochs).

495,How does their decoder generate text?,Decoder predicts the sequence of phoneme or grapheme at each time based on the previous output and context information with a beam search strategy.,"where INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 is the number of hidden units for the encoder and INLINEFORM2 is the number of hidden units for the decoder. Finally, the decoder task, which predicts the target sequence probability at time INLINEFORM3 based on previous output and context information INLINEFORM4 , can be formulated as: DISPLAYFORM0
The most common input INLINEFORM0 for speech recognition tasks is a sequence of feature vectors such as log Mel-spectral spectrogram and/or MFCC. Therefore, INLINEFORM1 where D is the number of the features and S is the total length of the utterance in frames. The output INLINEFORM2 can be either phoneme or grapheme (character) sequence.
In the decoding phase, we used a beam search strategy with beam size INLINEFORM0 and we adjusted the score by dividing with the transcription length to prevent the decoder from favoring shorter transcriptions. We did not use any language model or lexicon dictionary for decoding.

(Recall that higher valence means more positive sentiment.) In contrast, on the fear task, most submissions tended to assign higher scores to sentences with male noun phrases (23) as compared to the number of systems giving higher scores to sentences with female noun phrases (12). When predicting sadness, the number of submissions that mostly assigned higher scores to sentences with female noun phrases (18) is close to the number of submissions that mostly assigned higher scores to sentences with male noun phrases (16).

This first test allowed to measure the distance between the human markers. In fact, in order to get an idea of the quality of the human segmentations, the cuts in the texts made by the specialists were measured it versus the so-called “naifs” note takers and vice versa. The second series of tests consisted of using all the documents of the subcorpus “specialist” $E$, because the documents of the subcorpus of Annodis are not identical. Then we benchmarked the performance of the three systems automatically.
We have found that segmentation by experts and naive produces two subcorpus $E$ and $N$ with very similar characteristics. This surprised us, as we expected a more important difference between them.

The dataset from Twitter that we are using in our work, consists of a train set, a validation set and a test set. It was published for the ""First workshop on categorizing different types of online harassment languages in social media"". The whole dataset is divided into two categories, which are harassment and non-harassment tweets. Moreover, considering the type of the harassment, the tweets are divided into three sub-categories which are indirect harassment, sexual and physical harassment. We can see in Table TABREF1 the class distribution of our dataset. One important issue here is that the categories of indirect and physical harassment seem to be more rare in the train set than in the validation and test sets. To tackle this issue, as we describe in the next section, we are performing data augmentation techniques. However, the dataset is imbalanced and this has a significant impact in our results.","train set, validation set, and test set.",0.1249999953125001,0.0,0.1249999953125001,4.456882760699063,19.28832756532193,17.18389805032684,0.091743119266055,0.0077177508269018,0.0857007354497909,0.3518949179795752,0.0857007130980491,0.2291419953107834

B1. The first baseline uses only the salience-based features by Dunietz and Gillick BIBREF11 .
B2. The second baseline assigns the value relevant to a pair INLINEFORM0 , if and only if INLINEFORM1 appears in the title of INLINEFORM2 .
Here we show the evaluation setup for ASP task and discuss the results with a focus on three main aspects, (i) the overall performance across the years, (ii) the entity class specific performance, and (iii) the impact on entity profile expansion by suggesting missing sections to entities based on the pre-computed templates.
Baselines. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any comparable approach for this task. Therefore, the baselines we consider are the following:
S1: Pick the section from template INLINEFORM0 with the highest lexical similarity to INLINEFORM1 : S1 INLINEFORM2
S2: Place the news into the most frequent section in INLINEFORM0",The answer is S1 and S2.,0.0465116255056788,0.0,0.0465116255056788,0.6519556472039479,5.227845908243872,5.314963641143794,0.0249584026622296,0.0010702818408847,0.1336708068847656,0.2904628172312696,0.1478961706161499,0.2393568754196167
528,How do they determine the exact section to use the input article?,They use a multi-class classifier to determine the section it should be cited.,"We model the ASP placement task as a successor of the AEP task. For all the `relevant' news entity pairs, the task is to determine the correct entity section. Each section in a Wikipedia entity page represents a different topic. For example, Barack Obama has the sections `Early Life', `Presidency', `Family and Personal Life' etc. However, many entity pages have an incomplete section structure. Incomplete or missing sections are due to two Wikipedia properties. First, long-tail entities miss information and sections due to their lack of popularity. Second, for all entities whether popular or not, certain sections might occur for the first time due to real world developments. As an example, the entity Germanwings did not have an `Accidents' section before this year's disaster, which was the first in the history of the airline.
Article-Section Ground-truth. The dataset consists of the triple INLINEFORM0 , where INLINEFORM1 , where we assume that INLINEFORM2 has already been determined as relevant. We therefore have a multi-class classification problem where we need to determine the section of INLINEFORM3 where INLINEFORM4 is cited. Similar to the article-entity ground truth, here too the features compute the similarity between INLINEFORM5 , INLINEFORM6 and INLINEFORM7 .","They use multi-class classification based on similarity between article, entity, and section.",0.3199999950080001,0.0869565167485825,0.3199999950080001,6.649479326478728,40.708937059958686,35.67495264772081,0.2638297872340425,0.0118577075098814,0.6750912070274353,0.6418651666492223,0.6750910878181458,0.5095284581184387
529,What features are used to represent the novelty of news articles to entity pages?,KL-divergences of language models for the news article and the already added news references.,"An important feature when suggesting an article INLINEFORM0 to an entity INLINEFORM1 is the novelty of INLINEFORM2 w.r.t the already existing entity profile INLINEFORM3 . Studies BIBREF17 have shown that on comparable collections to ours (TREC GOV2) the number of duplicates can go up to INLINEFORM4 . This figure is likely higher for major events concerning highly authoritative entities on which all news media will report.
Given an entity INLINEFORM0 and the already added news references INLINEFORM1 up to year INLINEFORM2 , the novelty of INLINEFORM3 at year INLINEFORM4 is measured by the KL divergence between the language model of INLINEFORM5 and articles in INLINEFORM6 . We combine this measure with the entity overlap of INLINEFORM7 and INLINEFORM8 . The novelty value of INLINEFORM9 is given by the minimal divergence value. Low scores indicate low novelty for the entity profile INLINEFORM10 .","KL divergence, entity overlap.",0.0,0.0,0.0,2.627961710408444,29.678793735905444,23.878481647767387,0.0354609929078014,0.0028490028490028,0.4675309956073761,0.2917723676254009,0.4675309956073761,0.1203660666942596

As discussed in Section SECREF2 , a variety of features that measure salience of an entity in text are available from the NLP community. We reimplemented the ones in Dunietz and Gillick BIBREF11 .

531,How was annotation performed?,Experienced medical doctors used a linguistic annotation tool to annotate entities.,"We asked medical doctors experienced in extracting knowledge related to medical entities from texts to annotate the entities described above. Initially, we asked four annotators to test our guidelines on two texts. Subsequently, identified issues were discussed and resolved. Following this pilot annotation phase, we asked two different annotators to annotate two case reports according to our guidelines. The same annotators annotated an overall collection of 53 case reports.
The annotation was performed using WebAnno BIBREF7, a web-based tool for linguistic annotation. The annotators could choose between a pre-annotated version or a blank version of each text. The pre-annotated versions contained suggested entity spans based on string matches from lists of conditions and findings synonym lists. Their quality varied widely throughout the corpus. The blank version was preferred by the annotators. We distribute the corpus in BioC JSON format. BioC was chosen as it allows us to capture the complexities of the annotations in the biomedical domain. It represented each documents properties ranging from full text, individual passages/sentences along with captured annotations and relationships in an organized manner. BioC is based on character offsets of annotations and allows the stacking of different layers.","Using WebAnno, a web-based tool for linguistic annotation.",0.4210526267036011,0.1176470539792389,0.3157894688088643,8.516593018819643,43.04676696458517,39.664037568153525,0.3613465160075328,0.0088105726872246,0.6551604866981506,0.6896924740738338,0.6551603674888611,0.5711984634399414

We apply a 5 cross-validation on the account's level. For the FacTweet model, we experiment with 25% of the accounts for validation and parameters selection. We use hyperopt library to select the hyper-parameters on the following values: LSTM layer size (16, 32, 64), dropout ($0.0-0.9$), activation function ($relu$, $selu$, $tanh$), optimizer ($sgd$, $adam$, $rmsprop$) with varying the value of the learning rate (1e-1,..,-5), and batch size (4, 8, 16). The validation split is extracted on the class level using stratified sampling: we took a random 25% of the accounts from each class since the dataset is unbalanced. Discarding the classes' size in the splitting process may affect the minority classes (e.g. hoax). For the baselines' classifier, we tested many classifiers and the LR showed the best overall performance.","$relu$, $selu$, $tanh$.",0.0,0.0,0.0,4.444587794585869,19.06630084035673,19.32318185317444,0.217391304347826,0.0033222591362126,0.4080533683300018,0.6507936507936508,0.7379595637321472,0.0421098843216896
533,How are chunks defined?,Chunks is group of tweets from single account that  is consecutive in time - idea is that this group can show secret intention of malicious accounts.,"Given a news Twitter account, we read its tweets from the account's timeline. Then we sort the tweets by the posting date in ascending way and we split them into $N$ chunks. Each chunk consists of a sorted sequence of tweets labeled by the label of its corresponding account. We extract a set of features from each chunk and we feed them into a recurrent neural network to model the sequential flow of the chunks' tweets. We use an attention layer with dropout to attend over the most important tweets in each chunk. Finally, the representation is fed into a softmax layer to produce a probability distribution over the account types and thus predict the factuality of the accounts. Since we have many chunks for each account, the label for an account is obtained by taking the majority class of the account's chunks.
The main obstacle for detecting suspicious Twitter accounts is due to the behavior of mixing some real news with the misleading ones. Consequently, we investigate ways to detect suspicious accounts by considering their tweets in groups (chunks). Our hypothesis is that suspicious accounts have a unique pattern in posting tweet sequences. Since their intention is to mislead, the way they transition from one set of tweets to the next has a hidden signature, biased by their intentions. Therefore, reading these tweets in chunks has the potential to improve the detection of the fake news accounts.",By sorting tweets by posting date and splitting them into N chunks.,0.0606060559779617,0.0,0.0606060559779617,1.6504045595709425,23.33848910081122,19.087522956484072,0.05859375,0.0047770700636942,0.4980550706386566,0.4860069651703734,0.4980550110340118,0.4785555303096771

For comparison with previous AMR based summarization methods, we report the Recall, Precision and INLINEFORM0 scores for ROGUE-1. Since most of the literature on summarization uses INLINEFORM1 scores for ROGUE-2 and ROGUE-L for comparison, we also report INLINEFORM2 scores for ROGUE-2 and ROGUE-L for our method. ROGUE-1 Recall and Precision are measured for uni-gram overlap between the reference and the predicted summary. On the other hand, ROGUE-2 uses bi-gram overlap while ROGUE-L uses the longest common sequence between the target and the predicted summaries for evaluation.

Second, we try to capture the relation between the two most important entities (we define importance by the number of occurrences of the entity in the story) of the document.

Targeted Insult (TIN): Posts which contain an insult/threat to an individual, group, or others (see next layer);
Untargeted (UNT): Posts containing non-targeted profanity and swearing. Posts with general profanity are not targeted, but they contain non-acceptable language.
Level C categorizes the targets of insults and threats as individual (IND), group (GRP), and other (OTH).
Individual (IND): Posts targeting an individual. It can be a a famous person, a named individual or an unnamed participant in the conversation. Insults and threats targeted at individuals are often defined as cyberbulling.
Group (GRP): The target of these offensive posts is a group of people considered as a unity due to the same ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation, political affiliation, religious belief, or other common characteristic. Many of the insults and threats targeted at a group correspond to what is commonly understood as hate speech.

537,How long is the dataset for each step of hierarchy?,"Level A: 14100 Tweets
Level B: 4640 Tweets
Level C: 4089 Tweets.","The data included in OLID has been collected from Twitter. We retrieved the data using the Twitter API by searching for keywords and constructions that are often included in offensive messages, such as `she is' or `to:BreitBartNews'. We carried out a first round of trial annotation of 300 instances with six experts. The goal of the trial annotation was to 1) evaluate the proposed tagset; 2) evaluate the data retrieval method; and 3) create a gold standard with instances that could be used as test questions in the training and test setting annotation which was carried out using crowdsourcing. The breakdown of keywords and their offensive content in the trial data of 300 tweets is shown in Table TABREF14 . We included a left (@NewYorker) and far-right (@BreitBartNews) news accounts because there tends to be political offense in the comments. One of the best offensive keywords was tweets that were flagged as not being safe by the Twitter `safe' filter (the `-' indicates `not safe'). The vast majority of content on Twitter is not offensive so we tried different strategies to keep a reasonable number of tweets in the offensive class amounting to around 30% of the dataset including excluding some keywords that were not high in offensive content such as `they are` and `to:NewYorker`. Although `he is' is lower in offensive content we kept it as a keyword to avoid gender bias. In addition to the keywords in the trial set, we searched for more political keywords which tend to be higher in offensive content, and sampled our dataset such that 50% of the the tweets come from political keywords and 50% come from non-political keywords. In addition to the keywords `gun control', and `to:BreitbartNews', political keywords used to collect these tweets are `MAGA', `antifa', `conservative' and `liberal'. We computed Fliess' INLINEFORM0 on the trial set for the five annotators on 21 of the tweets. INLINEFORM1 is .83 for Layer A (OFF vs NOT) indicating high agreement. As to normalization and anonymization, no user metadata or Twitter IDs have been stored, and URLs and Twitter mentions have been substituted to placeholders. We follow prior work in related areas (burnap2015cyber,davidson2017automated) and annotate our data using crowdsourcing using the platform Figure Eight. We ensure data quality by: 1) we only received annotations from individuals who were experienced in the platform; and 2) we used test questions to discard annotations of individuals who did not reach a certain threshold. Each instance in the dataset was annotated by multiple annotators and inter-annotator agreement has been calculated. We first acquired two annotations for each instance. In case of 100% agreement, we considered these as acceptable annotations, and in case of disagreement, we requested more annotations until the agreement was above 66%. After the crowdsourcing annotation, we used expert adjudication to guarantee the quality of the annotation.

538,"In the proposed metric, how is content relevance measured?",The content relevance between the candidate summary and the human summary is evaluated using information retrieval - using the summaries as search queries and compare the overlaps of the retrieved results.,"Our proposed metric is based on analysis of the content relevance between a system generated summary and the corresponding human written gold-standard summaries. On high level, we indirectly evaluate the content relevance between the candidate summary and the human summary using information retrieval. To accomplish this, we use the summaries as search queries and compare the overlaps of the retrieved results. Larger number of overlaps, suggest that the candidate summary has higher content quality with respect to the gold-standard. This method, enables us to also reward for terms that are not lexically equivalent but semantically related. Our method is based on the well established linguistic premise that semantically related words occur in similar contexts BIBREF5 . The context of the words can be considered as surrounding words, sentences in which they appear or the documents. For scientific summarization, we consider the context of the words as the scientific articles in which they appear. Thus, if two concepts appear in identical set of articles, they are semantically related. We consider the two summaries as similar if they refer to same set of articles even if the two summaries do not have high lexical overlaps. To capture if a summary relates to a article, we use information retrieval by considering the summaries as queries and the articles as documents and we rank the articles based on their relatedness to a given summary. For a given pair of system summary and the gold summary, similar rankings of the retrieved articles suggest that the summaries are semantically related, and thus the system summary is of higher quality.",Using information retrieval and comparing overlaps of retrieved results.,0.4242424202754822,0.1578947335180056,0.4242424202754822,6.561789050024278,61.16281225761696,56.60494060661663,0.3145973154362416,0.003897791251624,0.62156081199646,0.9739785064202526,0.62156081199646,0.6839331984519958

Among all variants of Rouge, Rouge-2 and Rouge-3 are better correlated with manual judgments in the context of scientific summarization.

544,What are the distinctive characteristics of how Arabic speakers use offensive language?,"Frequent use of direct animal name calling, using simile and metaphors, through indirect speech like sarcasm, wishing evil to others, name alteration, societal stratification, immoral behavior and sexually related uses.","Next, we analyzed all tweets labeled as offensive to better understand how Arabic speakers use offensive language. Here is a breakdown of usage:
Direct name calling: The most frequent attack is to call a person an animal name, and the most used animals were كلب> (“klb” – “dog”), حمار> (“HmAr” – “donkey”), and بهيم> (“bhym” – “beast”). The second most common was insulting mental abilities using words such as غبي> (“gby” – “stupid”) and عبيط> (“EbyT” –“idiot”). Some culture-specific differences should be considered. Not all animal names are used as insults. For example, animals such as أسد> (“Asd” – “lion”), صقر> (“Sqr” – “falcon”), and غزال> (“gzAl” – “gazelle”) are typically used for praise. For other insults, people use: some bird names such as دجاجة> (“djAjp” – “chicken”), بومة> (“bwmp” – “owl”), and غراب> (“grAb” – “crow”); insects such as ذبابة> (“*bAbp” – “fly”), صرصور> (“SrSwr” – “cockroach”), and حشرة> (“H$rp” – “insect”); microorganisms such as جرثومة> (“jrvwmp” – “microbe”) and طحالب> (“THAlb” – “algae”); inanimate objects such as جزمة> (“jzmp” – “shoes”) and سطل> (“sTl” – “bucket”) among other usages.
Simile and metaphor: Users use simile and metaphor were they would compare a person to: an animal as in زي الثور> (“zy Alvwr” – “like a bull”), سمعني نهيقك> (“smEny nhyqk” – “let me hear your braying”), and هز ديلك> (“hz dylk” – “wag your tail”); a person with mental or physical disability such as منغولي> (“mngwly” – “Mongolian (down-syndrome)”), معوق> (“mEwq” – “disabled”), and قزم> (“qzm” – “dwarf”); and to the opposite gender such as جيش نوال> (“jy$ nwAl” – “Nawal's army (Nawal is female name)”) and نادي زيزي> (“nAdy zyzy” – “Zizi's club (Zizi is a female pet name)”).
Indirect speech: This type of offensive language includes: sarcasm such as أذكى إخواتك> (“A*kY AxwAtk” – “smartest one of your siblings”) and فيلسوف الحمير> (“fylswf AlHmyr” – “the donkeys' philosopher”); questions such as ايه كل الغباء ده> (“Ayh kl AlgbA dh” – “what is all this stupidity”); and indirect speech such as النقاش مع البهايم غير مثمر> (“AlnqA$ mE AlbhAym gyr mvmr” – “no use talking to cattle”).
Wishing Evil: This entails wishing death or major harm to befall someone such as ربنا ياخدك> (“rbnA yAxdk” – “May God take (kill) you”), الله يلعنك> (“Allh ylEnk” – “may Allah/God curse you”), and روح في داهية> (“rwH fy dAhyp” – equivalent to “go to hell”).
Name alteration: One common way to insult others is to change a letter or two in their names to produce new offensive words that rhyme with the original names. Some examples of such include changing الجزيرة> (“Aljzyrp” – “Aljazeera (channel)”) to الخنزيرة> (“Alxnzyrp” – “the pig”) and خلفان> (“xlfAn” – “Khalfan (person name)”) to خرفان> (“xrfAn” – “crazed”).
Societal stratification: Some insults are associated with: certain jobs such as بواب> (“bwAb” – “doorman”) or خادم> (“xAdm” – “servant”); and specific societal components such بدوي> (“bdwy” – “bedouin”) and فلاح> (“flAH” – “farmer”).
Immoral behavior: These insults are associated with negative moral traits or behaviors such as حقير> (“Hqyr” – “vile”), خاين> (“xAyn” – “traitor”), and منافق> (“mnAfq” – “hypocrite”).
Sexually related: They include expressions such as خول> (“xwl” – “gay”), وسخة> (“wsxp” – “prostitute”), and عرص> (“ErS” – “pimp”).","Culture-specific differences, use of simile and metaphor, indirect speech, name alteration, and societal stratification.",0.3902438981082689,0.1428571385827665,0.3902438981082689,10.903080234666804,56.92504707483725,55.61271802773934,0.4175349952815351,0.0060501296456352,0.5271726250648499,0.8649735877218172,0.5271726846694946,0.739139199256897
545,"In what way is the offensive dataset not biased by topic, dialect or target?","It does not use a seed list to gather tweets so the dataset does not skew to specific topics, dialect, targets.","Disclaimer: Due to the nature of the paper, some examples contain highly offensive language and hate speech. They don't reflect the views of the authors in any way, and the point of the paper is to help fight such speech. Much recent interest has focused on the detection of offensive language and hate speech in online social media. Such language is often associated with undesirable online behaviors such as trolling, cyberbullying, online extremism, political polarization, and propaganda. Thus, offensive language detection is instrumental for a variety of application such as: quantifying polarization BIBREF0, BIBREF1, trolls and propaganda account detection BIBREF2, detecting the likelihood of hate crimes BIBREF3; and predicting conflict BIBREF4. In this paper, we describe our methodology for building a large dataset of Arabic offensive tweets. Given that roughly 1-2% of all Arabic tweets are offensive BIBREF5, targeted annotation is essential for efficiently building a large dataset. Since our methodology does not use a seed list of offensive words, it is not biased by topic, target, or dialect. Using our methodology, we tagged 10,000 Arabic tweet dataset for offensiveness, where offensive tweets account for roughly 19% of the tweets. Further, we labeled tweets as vulgar or hate speech. To date, this is the largest available dataset, which we plan to make publicly available along with annotation guidelines. We use this dataset to characterize Arabic offensive language to ascertain the topics, dialects, and users' gender that are most associated with the use of offensive language. Though we suspect that there are common features that span different languages and cultures, some characteristics of Arabic offensive language is language and culture specific. Thus, we conduct a thorough analysis of how Arabic users use offensive language. Next, we use the dataset to train strong Arabic offensive language classifiers using state-of-the-art representations and classification techniques. Specifically, we experiment with static and contextualized embeddings for representation along with a variety of classifiers such as a deep neural network classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM).",It does not use a seed list of offensive words.,0.4999999954081633,0.4285714242091837,0.4999999954081633,24.76980256562108,45.9088226201115,47.76358670188944,0.3303964757709251,0.0070921985815602,0.5469880104064941,0.6741203963756561,0.5469880700111389,0.74111008644104
546,How did the authors find ironic data on twitter?,They developed a classifier to find ironic sentences in twitter data.,"As neural networks are proved effective in irony detection, we decide to implement a neural classifier in order to classify the sentences into ironic and non-ironic sentences. However, the only high-quality irony dataset we can obtain is the dataset of Semeval-2018 Task 3 and the dataset is pretty small, which will cause overfitting to complex models. Therefore, we just implement a simple one-layer RNN with LSTM cell to classify pre-processed sentences into ironic sentences and non-ironic sentences because LSTM networks are widely used in irony detection. We train the model with the dataset of Semeval-2018 Task 3. After classification, we get 262,755 ironic sentences and 399,775 non-ironic sentences. According to our observation, not all non-ironic sentences are suitable to be transferred into ironic sentences. For example, “just hanging out . watching . is it monday yet"" is hard to transfer because it does not have an explicit sentiment polarity. So we remove all interrogative sentences from the non-ironic sentences and only obtain the sentences which have words expressing strong sentiments. We evaluate the sentiment polarity of each word with TextBlob and we view those words with sentiment scores greater than 0.5 or less than -0.5 as words expressing strong sentiments. Finally, we build our irony dataset with 262,755 ironic sentences and 102,330 non-ironic sentences.",They didn't.,0.1538461512426036,0.0,0.1538461512426036,4.02724819242185,17.98303950229161,18.83482846226906,0.0892857142857142,0.0019960079840319,0.1678832024335861,0.0,0.1678832024335861,
547,"Who judged the irony accuracy, sentiment preservation and content preservation?",Irony accuracy is judged only by human ; senriment preservation and content preservation are judged  both by human and using automatic metrics (ACC and BLEU).,"In order to evaluate sentiment preservation, we use the absolute value of the difference between the standardized sentiment score of the input sentence and that of the generated sentence. We call the value as sentiment delta (senti delta). Besides, we report the sentiment accuracy (Senti ACC) which measures whether the output sentence has the same sentiment polarity as the input sentence based on our standardized sentiment classifiers. The BLEU score BIBREF25 between the input sentences and the output sentences is calculated to evaluate the content preservation performance. In order to evaluate the overall performance of different models, we also report the geometric mean (G2) and harmonic mean (H2) of the sentiment accuracy and the BLEU score.

548,How were the tweets annotated?,Tweets are annotated with only Favor or Against for two targets - Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe.,"We have decided to consider tweets about popular sports clubs as our domain for stance detection. Considerable amounts of tweets are being published for sports-related events at every instant. Hence we have determined our targets as Galatasaray (namely Target-1) and Fenerbahçe (namely, Target-2) which are two of the most popular football clubs in Turkey. As is the case for the sentiment analysis tools, the outputs of the stance detection systems on a stream of tweets about these clubs can facilitate the use of the opinions of the football followers by these clubs.
In a previous study on the identification of public health-related tweets, two tweet data sets in Turkish (each set containing 1 million random tweets) have been compiled where these sets belong to two different periods of 20 consecutive days BIBREF11 . We have decided to use one of these sets (corresponding to the period between August 18 and September 6, 2015) and firstly filtered the tweets using the possible names used to refer to the target clubs. Then, we have annotated the stance information in the tweets for these targets as Favor or Against. Within the course of this study, we have not considered those tweets in which the target is not explicitly mentioned, as our initial filtering process reveals.
For the purposes of the current study, we have not annotated any tweets with the Neither class. This stance class and even finer-grained classes can be considered in further annotation studies. We should also note that in a few tweets, the target of the stance was the management of the club while in some others a particular footballer of the club is praised or criticised. Still, we have considered the club as the target of the stance in all of the cases and carried out our annotations accordingly.",As Favor or Against.,0.3157894703601109,0.2352941147404844,0.3157894703601109,9.782375748961451,43.75209900510846,44.201396419371726,0.2516778523489933,0.0030674846625766,0.268808513879776,0.4507786691188812,0.268808513879776,

551,How does this model overcome the assumption that all words in a document are generated from a single event?,By learning a projection function between the document-event distribution and four event related word distributions.,"To extract structured representations of events such as who did what, when, where and why, Bayesian approaches have made some progress. Assuming that each document is assigned to a single event, which is modeled as a joint distribution over the named entities, the date and the location of the event, and the event-related keywords, Zhou et al. zhou2014simple proposed an unsupervised Latent Event Model (LEM) for open-domain event extraction. To address the limitation that LEM requires the number of events to be pre-set, Zhou et al. zhou2017event further proposed the Dirichlet Process Event Mixture Model (DPEMM) in which the number of events can be learned automatically from data. However, both LEM and DPEMM have two limitations: (1) they assume that all words in a document are generated from a single event which can be represented by a quadruple INLINEFORM0 entity, location, keyword, date INLINEFORM1 . However, long texts such news articles often describe multiple events which clearly violates this assumption; (2) During the inference process of both approaches, the Gibbs sampler needs to compute the conditional posterior distribution and assigns an event for each document. This is time consuming and takes long time to converge.
To deal with these limitations, in this paper, we propose the Adversarial-neural Event Model (AEM) based on adversarial training for open-domain event extraction. The principle idea is to use a generator network to learn the projection function between the document-event distribution and four event related word distributions (entity distribution, location distribution, keyword distribution and date distribution). Instead of providing an analytic approximation, AEM uses a discriminator network to discriminate between the reconstructed documents from latent events and the original input documents. This essentially helps the generator to construct a more realistic document from a random noise drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Due to the flexibility of neural networks, the generator is capable of learning complicated nonlinear distributions. And the supervision signal provided by the discriminator will help generator to capture the event-related patterns. Furthermore, the discriminator also provides low-dimensional discriminative features which can be used to visualize documents and events.",It uses a generator network to learn the projection function between the document-event distribution and four event-related word distributions.,0.6666666617079889,0.4999999950781251,0.6666666617079889,42.24046321224261,75.4317912223149,70.56844914587114,0.7811372492423149,0.0206746463547334,0.7992680072784424,0.7205788006645968,0.7992680668830872,0.6750546097755432
552,What are the hyperparameters of the bi-GRU?,They use the embedding layer with a size 35 and embedding dimension of 300. They use a dense layer with 70 units and a dropout layer with a rate of 50%.,"Minimal pre-processing was done by converting text to lower case, removing the hashtags at the end of tweets and separating each punctuation from the connected token (e.g., awesome!! INLINEFORM0 awesome !!) and replacing comma and new-line characters with white space. The text, then, was tokenized using TensorFlow-Keras tokenizer. Top N terms were selected and added to our dictionary where N=100k for higher count emotions joy, sadness, anger, love and N=50k for thankfulness and fear and N=25k for surprise. Seven binary classifiers were trained for the seven emotions with a batch size of 250 and for 20 epochs with binary cross-entropy as the objective function and Adam optimizer. The architecture of the model can be seen in Figure FIGREF6 . For training each classifier, a balanced dataset was created with selecting all tweets from the target set as class 1 and a random sample of the same size from other classes as class 0. For each classifier, 80% of the data was randomly selected as the training set, and 10% for the validation set, and 10% as the test set. As mentioned before we used the two embedding models, ConceptNet Numberbatch and fastText as the two more modern pre-trained word vector spaces to see how changing the embedding layer can affect the performance. The result of comparison among different embeddings can be seen in Table TABREF10 . It can be seen that the best performance was divided between the two embedding models with minor performance variations.

554,What background knowledge do they leverage?,"Labelled features, which are words whose presence strongly indicates a specific class or topic.","We address the robustness problem on top of GE-FL BIBREF0 , a GE method which leverages labeled features as prior knowledge. A labeled feature is a strong indicator of a specific class and is manually provided to the classifier. For example, words like amazing, exciting can be labeled features for class positive in sentiment classification.
As described in BIBREF0 , there are two ways to obtain labeled features. The first way is to use information gain. We first calculate the mutual information of all features according to the labels of the documents and select the top 20 as labeled features for each class as a feature pool. Note that using information gain requires the document label, but this is only to simulate how we human provide prior knowledge to the model. The second way is to use LDA BIBREF9 to select features. We use the same selection process as BIBREF0 , where they first train a LDA on the dataset, and then select the most probable features of each topic (sorted by $P(w_i|t_j)$ , the probability of word $w_i$ given topic $t_j$ ).

556,How do they define robustness of a model?,"Ability to accurately classify texts even when the amount of prior knowledge for different classes is unbalanced, and when the class distribution of the dataset is unbalanced.","GE-FL reduces the heavy load of instance annotation and performs well when we provide prior knowledge with no bias. In our experiments, we observe that comparable numbers of labeled features for each class have to be supplied. But as mentioned before, it is often the case that we are not able to provide enough knowledge for some of the classes. For the baseball-hockey classification task, as shown before, GE-FL will predict most of the instances as baseball. In this section, we will show three terms to make the model more robust.
(a) We randomly select $t \in [1, 20]$ features from the feature pool for one class, and only one feature for the other. The original balanced movie dataset is used (positive:negative=1:1).
Our methods are also evaluated on datasets with different unbalanced class distributions. We manually construct several movie datasets with class distributions of 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 by randomly removing 50%, 67%, 75% positive documents. The original balanced movie dataset is used as a control group. We test with both balanced and unbalanced labeled features. For the balanced case, we randomly select 10 features from the feature pool for each class, and for the unbalanced case, we select 10 features for one class, and 1 feature for the other. Results are shown in Figure 3 .
Figure 3 (b) shows that when the labeled features are unbalanced, our methods significantly outperforms GE-FL. Incorporating KL divergence is robust enough to control unbalance both in the dataset and in labeled features while the other three methods are not so competitive.",Robustness is defined as the model's ability to perform well under unbalanced class distributions in both the dataset and labeled features.,0.3333333283446712,0.0444444395061733,0.1904761854875285,3.748131723822483,42.00905823682506,36.87461096847879,0.3128273774880689,0.0090478242137009,0.4657472372055053,0.6575717822779685,0.465747207403183,0.616642415523529
557,What TIMIT datasets are used for testing?,"Once split into 8 subsets (A-H), the test set used are blocks D+H and blocks F+H.","In order to achieve these configuration the TIMIT data was split. Fig. FIGREF12 illustrates the split of the data into 8 subsets (A–H). The TIMIT dataset contains speech from 462 speakers in training and 168 speakers in the test set, with 8 utterances for each speaker. The TIMIT training and test set are split into 8 blocks, where each block contains 2 utterances per speaker, randomly chosen. Thus each block A,B,C,D contains data from 462 speakers with 924 utterances taken from the training sets, and each block E,F,G,H contains speech from 168 test set speakers with 336 utterances.
For Task a training of embeddings and the classifier is identical, namely consisting of data from blocks (A+B+C+E+F+G). The test data is the remainder, namely blocks (D+H). For Task b the training of embeddings and classifiers uses (A+B+E+F) and (C+G) respectively, while again using (D+H) for test. Task c keeps both separate: embeddings are trained on (A+B+C+D), classifiers on (E+G) and tests are conducted on (F+H). Note that H is part of all tasks, and that Task c is considerably easier as the number of speakers to separate is only 168, although training conditions are more difficult.",The answer is blocks (D+H).,0.0999999962500001,0.0,0.0999999962500001,7.238177794755686,23.47555286402076,20.582943136936688,0.1595744680851063,0.0035587188612099,0.5613000392913818,0.4756824723605453,0.5612999796867371,

The structured answer-relevant relation is likely to be to the point context and thus can help keep the generated question to the point. For example, Figure FIGREF1 shows our framework can extract the right answer-relevant relation (“The daily mean temperature in January”, “is”, “32.6$^\circ $F (0.3$^\circ $C)”) among multiple facts. With the help of such structured information, our model is less likely to be confused by sentences with a complex structure. Specifically, we firstly extract multiple relations with an off-the-shelf Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) toolbox BIBREF7, then we select the relation that is most relevant to the answer with carefully designed heuristic rules.",They use an off-the-shelf Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) toolbox and heuristic rules.,0.3199999950080001,0.166666661701389,0.3199999950080001,8.225964699966553,40.018693141515605,36.31707467290647,0.3816326530612244,0.0091463414634146,0.491086483001709,0.5574680504045988,0.491086483001709,0.5982031226158142

Our proposed model which combines structured answer-relevant relations and unstructured sentences achieves significant improvements over proximity-based answer-aware models BIBREF9, BIBREF15 on both dataset splits.

Moreover, our proposed framework is a general one to jointly leverage structured relations and unstructured sentences. All compared baseline models which only consider unstructured sentences can be further enhanced under our framework.

566,How do they measure which words are under-translated by NMT models?,"They measured the under-translated words with low word importance score as calculated by Attribution.
method.","In this experiment, we propose to use the estimated word importance to detect the under-translated words by NMT models. Intuitively, under-translated input words should contribute little to the NMT outputs, yielding much smaller word importance. Given 500 Chinese$\Rightarrow $English sentence pairs translated by the Transformer model (BLEU 23.57), we ask ten human annotators to manually label the under-translated input words, and at least two annotators label each input-hypothesis pair. These annotators have at least six years of English study experience, whose native language is Chinese. Among these sentences, 178 sentences have under-translation errors with 553 under-translated words in total.
Table TABREF32 lists the accuracy of detecting under-translation errors by comparing words of least importance and human-annotated under-translated words. As seen, our Attribution method consistently and significantly outperforms both Erasure and Attention approaches. By exploiting the word importance calculated by Attribution method, we can identify the under-translation errors automatically without the involvement of human interpreters. Although the accuracy is not high, it is worth noting that our under-translation method is very simple and straightforward. This is potentially useful for debugging NMT models, e.g., automatic post-editing with constraint decoding BIBREF26, BIBREF27.",By calculating word importance using the Attribution method.,0.4347826041587901,0.1904761860317461,0.3478260824196598,7.158561577277536,54.1939221850407,50.33062358787763,0.3896604938271605,0.0066225165562913,0.7454311847686768,0.8380233672532169,0.6815172433853149,0.850170373916626
567,How do their models decide how much improtance to give to the output words?,They compute the gradient of the output at each time step with respect to the input words to decide the importance.,"Formally, let $\textbf {x} = (x_1, ..., x_M)$ be the input sentence and $\textbf {x}^{\prime }$ be a baseline input. $F$ is a well-trained NMT model, and $F(\textbf {x})_n$ is the model output (i.e., $P(y_n|\textbf {y}_{<n},\textbf {x})$) at time step $n$. Integrated gradients is then defined as the integral of gradients along the straightline path from the baseline $\textbf {x}^{\prime }$ to the input $\textbf {x}$. In detail, the contribution of the $m^{th}$ word in $\textbf {x}$ to the prediction of $F(\textbf {x})_n$ is defined as follows.
where $\frac{\partial {F(\textbf {x})_n}}{\partial {\textbf {x}_m}}$ is the gradient of $F(\textbf {x})_n$ w.r.t. the embedding of the $m^{th}$ word. In this paper, as suggested, the baseline input $\textbf {x}^{\prime }$ is set as a sequence of zero embeddings that has the same sequence length $M$. In this way, we can compute the contribution of a specific input word to a designated output word.

570,How do the authors examine whether a model is robust to noise or not?,By evaluating their model on adversarial sets containing misleading sentences.,"MRC Dataset. The MRC dataset used in this paper is SQuAD 1.1, which contains over INLINEFORM0 passage-question pairs and has been randomly partitioned into three parts: a training set ( INLINEFORM1 ), a development set ( INLINEFORM2 ), and a test set ( INLINEFORM3 ). Besides, we also use two of its adversarial sets, namely AddSent and AddOneSent BIBREF6 , to evaluate the robustness to noise of MRC models. The passages in the adversarial sets contain misleading sentences, which are aimed at distracting MRC models. Specifically, each passage in AddSent contains several sentences that are similar to the question but not contradictory to the answer, while each passage in AddOneSent contains a human-approved random sentence that may be unrelated to the passage.
We compare KAR with other MRC models in both performance and the robustness to noise. Specifically, we not only evaluate the performance of KAR on the development set and the test set, but also do this on the adversarial sets. As for the comparative objects, we only consider the single MRC models that rank in the top 20 on the SQuAD 1.1 leader board and have reported their performance on the adversarial sets. There are totally five such comparative objects, which can be considered as representatives of the state-of-the-art MRC models. As shown in Table TABREF12 , on the development set and the test set, the performance of KAR is on par with that of the state-of-the-art MRC models; on the adversarial sets, KAR outperforms the state-of-the-art MRC models by a large margin.

572,What are the user-defined keywords?,Words that a user wants them to appear in the generated output.,"Nonetheless, GANs have continued to show their value particularly in the domain of text-generation. Of particular interest for our purposes, Radford et al. propose synthesizing images from text descriptions [3]. The group demonstrates how GANs can produce images that correspond to a user-defined text description. It thus seems feasible that by using a similar model, we can produce text samples that are conditioned upon a set of user-specified keywords.
where x is defined as the predicted label for each sample and y is the true label (i.e. real versus fake data). The DMK loss then calculates an additional term, which corresponds to the dot-product attention of each word in the generated output with each keyword specified by the user. To illustrate by example, say a user desires the generated output to contain the keywords, $\lbrace subway, manhattan\rbrace $ . The model then converts each of these keywords to their corresponding glove vectors. Let us define the following notation $e(‘apple’)$ is the GloVe representation of the word apple, and let us suppose that $g$ is the vector of word embeddings generated by the generator. That is, $g_1$ is the first word embedding of the generator’s output. Let us also suppose $k$ is a vector of the keywords specified by the user. In our examples, $k$ is always in $R^{1}$ with $k_1$ one equaling of $‘subway’$ or $‘parking’$ . The dot-product term of the DMK loss then calculates $e(‘apple’)$0 .

573,What are the user-defined keywords?,"Terms common to hosts' descriptions of popular Airbnb properties, like 'subway', 'manhattan', or 'parking'","The data for the project was acquired from Airdna, a data processing service that collaborates with Airbnb to produce high-accuracy data summaries for listings in geographic regions of the United States. For the sake of simplicity, we focus our analysis on Airbnb listings from Manhattan, NY, during the time period of January 1, 2016, to January 1, 2017. The data provided to us contained information for roughly 40,000 Manhattan listings that were posted on Airbnb during this defined time period. For each listing, we were given information of the amenities of the listing (number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms …), the listing’s zip code, the host’s description of the listing, the price of the listing, and the occupancy rate of the listing. Airbnb defines a home's occupancy rate, as the percentage of time that a listing is occupied over the time period that the listing is available. This gives us a reasonable metric for defining popular versus less popular listings.

The DMK loss then calculates an additional term, which corresponds to the dot-product attention of each word in the generated output with each keyword specified by the user. To illustrate by example, say a user desires the generated output to contain the keywords, $\lbrace subway, manhattan\rbrace $ . The model then converts each of these keywords to their corresponding glove vectors. Let us define the following notation $e(‘apple’)$ is the GloVe representation of the word apple, and let us suppose that $g$ is the vector of word embeddings generated by the generator. That is, $g_1$ is the first word embedding of the generator’s output. Let us also suppose $k$ is a vector of the keywords specified by the user. In our examples, $k$ is always in $R^{1}$ with $k_1$ one equaling of $‘subway’$ or $‘parking’$ . The dot-product term of the DMK loss then calculates $e(‘apple’)$0 . Weighing this term by some hyper-parameter, $e(‘apple’)$1 , then gives us the entire definition of the DMK loss: $e(‘apple’)$2 $e(‘apple’)$3","The answer is $\lbrace subway, manhattan\rbrace$.",0.0,0.0,0.0,2.2869567780619007,27.6890413528236,21.90323506718605,0.0251256281407035,0.0042674253200568,0.3788418173789978,0.1269309569180496,0.378841757774353,

577,What additional features and context are proposed?,Using tweets that one has replied or quoted to as contextual information.,"While manually analyzing the raw dataset, we noticed that looking at the tweet one has replied to or has quoted, provides significant contextual information. We call these, “context tweets"". As humans can better understand a tweet with the reference of its context, our assumption is that computers also benefit from taking context tweets into account in detecting abusive language.
As shown in the examples below, (2) is labeled abusive due to the use of vulgar language. However, the intention of the user can be better understood with its context tweet (1).

Huang et al. huang2016modeling used several attributes of context tweets for sentiment analysis in order to improve the baseline LSTM model. However, their approach was limited because the meta-information they focused on—author information, conversation type, use of the same hashtags or emojis—are all highly dependent on data.
In order to avoid data dependency, text sequences of context tweets are directly used as an additional feature of neural network models. We use the same baseline model to convert context tweets to vectors, then concatenate these vectors with outputs of their corresponding labeled tweets. More specifically, we concatenate max-pooled layers of context and labeled tweets for the CNN baseline model. As for RNN, the last hidden states of context and labeled tweets are concatenated.",Text sequences of context tweets.,0.1176470546712804,0.0,0.1176470546712804,3.673526562988939,30.273960790518657,26.084013752821413,0.08130081300813,0.0041493775933609,0.641062319278717,0.5801949611265365,0.6410622596740723,0.3271171450614929
578,What evidence do the authors present that the model can capture some biases in data annotation and collection?,The authors showed few tweets where neither and implicit hatred content exist but the model was able to discriminate.,"By examining more samples and with respect to recently studies BIBREF2, BIBREF24, BIBREF19, it is clear that many errors are due to biases from data collection BIBREF19 and rules of annotation BIBREF24 and not the classifier itself. Since Waseem et al.BIBREF5 created a small ad-hoc set of keywords and Davidson et al.BIBREF9 used a large crowdsourced dictionary of keywords (Hatebase lexicon) to sample tweets for training, they included some biases in the collected data. Especially for Davidson-dataset, some tweets with specific language (written within the African American Vernacular English) and geographic restriction (United States of America) are oversampled such as tweets containing disparage words “nigga"", “faggot"", “coon"", or “queer"", result in high rates of misclassification. However, these misclassifications do not confirm the low performance of our classifier because annotators tended to annotate many samples containing disrespectful words as hate or offensive without any presumption about the social context of tweeters such as the speaker’s identity or dialect, whereas they were just offensive or even neither tweets. Tweets IDs 6, 8, and 10 are some samples containing offensive words and slurs which arenot hate or offensive in all cases and writers of them used this type of language in their daily communications. Given these pieces of evidence, by considering the content of tweets, we can see in tweets IDs 3, 4, and 9 that our BERT-based classifier can discriminate tweets in which neither and implicit hatred content exist. One explanation of this observation may be the pre-trained general knowledge that exists in our model. Since the pre-trained BERT model is trained on general corpora, it has learned general knowledge from normal textual data without any purposely hateful or offensive language. Therefore, despite the bias in the data, our model can differentiate hate and offensive samples accurately by leveraging knowledge-aware language understanding that it has and it can be the main reason for high misclassifications of hate samples as offensive (in reality they are more similar to offensive rather than hate by considering social context, geolocation, and dialect of tweeters).","Tweets IDs 6, 8, and 10, which contain offensive words but are not hate or offensive in all cases.",0.1081081031117606,0.0,0.1081081031117606,2.168776966261936,21.244674058167966,17.64159585877775,0.1231527093596059,0.0099009900990099,0.662381112575531,0.4250591632760601,0.6623811721801758,0.5238174796104431
579,What are the existing biases?,Sampling tweets from specific keywords create systematic and substancial racial biases in datasets.,"As one of the first attempts in neural network models, Djuric et al. BIBREF16 proposed a two-step method including a continuous bag of words model to extract paragraph2vec embeddings and a binary classifier trained along with the embeddings to distinguish between hate speech and clean content. Badjatiya et al. BIBREF0 investigated three deep learning architectures, FastText, CNN, and LSTM, in which they initialized the word embeddings with either random or GloVe embeddings. Gambäck et al. BIBREF6 proposed a hate speech classifier based on CNN model trained on different feature embeddings such as word embeddings and character $n$-grams. Zhang et al. BIBREF7 used a CNN+GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit network) neural network model initialized with pre-trained word2vec embeddings to capture both word/character combinations (e. g., $n$-grams, phrases) and word/character dependencies (order information). Waseem et al. BIBREF10 brought a new insight to hate speech and abusive language detection tasks by proposing a multi-task learning framework to deal with datasets across different annotation schemes, labels, or geographic and cultural influences from data sampling. Founta et al. BIBREF17 built a unified classification model that can efficiently handle different types of abusive language such as cyberbullying, hate, sarcasm, etc. using raw text and domain-specific metadata from Twitter. Furthermore, researchers have recently focused on the bias derived from the hate speech training datasets BIBREF18, BIBREF2, BIBREF19. Davidson et al. BIBREF2 showed that there were systematic and substantial racial biases in five benchmark Twitter datasets annotated for offensive language detection. Wiegand et al. BIBREF19 also found that classifiers trained on datasets containing more implicit abuse (tweets with some abusive words) are more affected by biases rather than once trained on datasets with a high proportion of explicit abuse samples (tweets containing sarcasm, jokes, etc.).
By examining more samples and with respect to recently studies BIBREF2, BIBREF24, BIBREF19, it is clear that many errors are due to biases from data collection BIBREF19 and rules of annotation BIBREF24 and not the classifier itself. Since Waseem et al.BIBREF5 created a small ad-hoc set of keywords and Davidson et al.BIBREF9 used a large crowdsourced dictionary of keywords (Hatebase lexicon) to sample tweets for training, they included some biases in the collected data.

585,How do they encourage understanding of literature as part of their objective function?,"They group the existing works in terms of the objective function they optimize - within-tweet relationships, inter-tweet relationships, autoencoder, and weak supervision.","Despite this, there is a lack of prior work which surveys the tweet-specific unsupervised representation learning models. In this work, we attempt to fill this gap by investigating the models in an organized fashion. Specifically, we group the models based on the objective function it optimizes. We believe this work can aid the understanding of the existing literature. We conclude the paper by presenting interesting future research directions, which we believe are fruitful in advancing this field by building high-quality tweet representation learning models.
There are various models spanning across different model architectures and objective functions in the literature to compute tweet representation in an unsupervised fashion. These models work in a semi-supervised way - the representations generated by the model is fed to an off-the-shelf predictor like Support Vector Machines (SVM) to solve a particular downstream task. These models span across a wide variety of neural network based architectures including average of word vectors, convolutional-based, recurrent-based and so on. We believe that the performance of these models is highly dependent on the objective function it optimizes – predicting adjacent word (within-tweet relationships), adjacent tweet (inter-tweet relationships), the tweet itself (autoencoder), modeling from structured resources like paraphrase databases and weak supervision. In this section, we provide the first of its kind survey of the recent tweet-specific unsupervised models in an organized fashion to understand the literature.

The first challenge is to acquire very large Vietnamese corpus and to use them in building a classifier, which could further improve accuracy. In addition, applying linguistics knowledge on word context to extract useful features also enhances prediction performance. The second challenge is design and development of big data warehouse and analytic framework for Vietnamese documents, which corresponds to the rapid and continuous growth of gigantic volume of articles and/or documents from Web 2.0 applications, such as, Facebook, Twitter, and so on. It should be addressed that there are many kinds of Vietnamese documents, for example, Han - Nom documents and old and modern Vietnamese documents that are essential and still needs further analysis.

591,How do they verify generalization ability?,By calculating Macro F1 metric at the document level.,"Training We collect 50,000 Wikipedia articles according to the number of its hyperlinks as our training data. For efficiency, we trim the articles to the first three paragraphs leading to 1,035,665 mentions in total. Using CoNLL-Test A as the development set, we evaluate the trained NCEL on the above benchmarks. We set context window to 20, neighbor mention window to 6, and top INLINEFORM0 candidates for each mention. We use two layers with 2000 and 1 hidden units in MLP encoder, and 3 layers in sub-GCN. We use early stop and fine tune the embeddings. With a batch size of 16, nearly 3 epochs cost less than 15 minutes on the server with 20 core CPU and the GeForce GTX 1080Ti GPU with 12Gb memory.

The results are shown in Table FIGREF28 and Table FIGREF28 . We can see the average linking precision (Micro) of WW is lower than that of TAC2010, and NCEL outperforms all baseline methods in both easy and hard cases. In the “easy"" case, local models have similar performance with global models since only little global information is available (2 mentions per document).

It is widely believed that lemmatization or other text input normalisation is not necessary. Advanced neural architectures based on character input (CNNs, BPE, etc) are supposed to be able to learn how to handle spelling and morphology variations themselves, even for languages with rich morphology: `just add more layers!'.

The RNC texts were added to the Russian Wikipedia dump so as to make the Russian training corpus more comparable in size to the English one (Wikipedia texts would comprise only half of the size).

595,"What does the ""sensitivity"" quantity denote?",The expected number of unique outputs a word recognition system assigns to a set of adversarial perturbations.,"In NLP, we often get such invariance for free, e.g., for a word-level model, most of the perturbations produced by our character-level adversary lead to an UNK at its input. If the model is robust to the presence of these UNK tokens, there is little room for an adversary to manipulate it. Character-level models, on the other hand, despite their superior performance in many tasks, do not enjoy such invariance. This characteristic invariance could be exploited by an attacker. Thus, to limit the number of different inputs to the classifier, we wish to reduce the number of distinct word recognition outputs that an attacker can induce, not just the number of words on which the model is “fooled”. We denote this property of a model as its sensitivity.
We can quantify this notion for a word recognition system $W$ as the expected number of unique outputs it assigns to a set of adversarial perturbations. Given a sentence $s$ from the set of sentences $\mathcal {S}$ , let $A(s) = {s_1}^{\prime } , {s_2}^{\prime }, \dots , {s_n}^{\prime }$ denote the set of $n$ perturbations to it under attack type $A$ , and let $V$ be the function that maps strings to an input representation for the downstream classifier. For a word level model, $V$ would transform sentences to a sequence of word ids, mapping OOV words to the same UNK ID. Whereas, for a char (or word+char, word-piece) model, $V$ would map inputs to a sequence of character IDs. Formally, sensitivity is defined as",the expected number of unique outputs a model assigns to a set of adversarial perturbations.,0.7857142807397959,0.7333333283555556,0.7857142807397959,65.40585844910977,86.10579780917095,85.0041357158977,0.8416978776529339,0.0476190476190476,0.839181661605835,0.9123636438296392,0.8391817212104797,0.8533942699432373
596,What end tasks do they evaluate on?,Sentiment analysis and paraphrase detection under adversarial attacks.,"For sentiment classification, we systematically study the effect of character-level adversarial attacks on two architectures and four different input formats. The first architecture encodes the input sentence into a sequence of embeddings, which are then sequentially processed by a BiLSTM. The first and last states of the BiLSTM are then used by the softmax layer to predict the sentiment of the input. We consider three input formats for this architecture: (1) Word-only: where the input words are encoded using a lookup table; (2) Char-only: where the input words are encoded using a separate single-layered BiLSTM over their characters; and (3) Word $+$ Char: where the input words are encoded using a concatenation of (1) and (2) .

Let $s = \lbrace w_1, w_2, \dots , w_n\rbrace $ denote the input sentence, a sequence of constituent words $w_i$ . Each input word ( $w_i$ ) is represented by concatenating (i) a one hot vector of the first character ( $\mathbf {w_{i1}}$ ); (ii) a one hot representation of the last character ( $\mathbf {w_{il}}$ , where $l$ is the length of word $w_i$ ); and (iii) a bag of characters representation of the internal characters ( $\sum _{j=2}^{l-1}\mathbf {w_{ij}})$ . ScRNN treats the first and the last characters individually, and is agnostic to the ordering of the internal characters. Each word, represented accordingly, is then fed into a BiLSTM cell.

Figure FIGREF11 shows the accuracy results of the four hybrid approaches. By combining the best three popularity-based approaches, we outperform all of the initially evaluated popularity algorithms (i.e., INLINEFORM0 for INLINEFORM1 ). On the contrary, the combination of the two best performing similarity-based approaches INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 does not yield better accuracy. The negative impact of using a lower-performing approach such as INLINEFORM4 within a hybrid combination can also be observed in INLINEFORM5 for lower values of INLINEFORM6 . Overall, this confirms our initial intuition that combining the best performing popularity-based approach with the best similarity-based approach should result in the highest accuracy (i.e., INLINEFORM7 for INLINEFORM8 ).

We employ two sources of e-book annotation data: (i) editor tags, and (ii) Amazon search terms.

Data used to evaluate recommendations. For evaluation, we use a third set of e-book annotations, namely Amazon review keywords. These review keywords are extracted from the Amazon review texts and are typically provided in the review section of books on Amazon. Our idea is to not favor one or the other data source (i.e., editor tags and Amazon search terms) when evaluating our approaches against expected tags.

The movement, however, did not remain confined amongst the members of the party themselves and soon, several Twitter users updated their profiles as well. We opine that the whole campaign of adding Chowkidar to the profile attributes show an inorganic behavior, with political leaders acting as the catalyst. An interesting aspect of this campaign was the fact that the users used several different variants of the word Chowkidar while adding it to their Twitter profiles. Some of the most common variants of Chowkidar that were present in our dataset along with its frequency of use is shown in Figure FIGREF24.
We believe, the effect of changing the profile attribute in accordance with Prime Minister's campaign is an example of inorganic behavior contagion BIBREF6, BIBREF9. The authors in BIBREF6 argue that opinion diffuses easily in a network if it comes from opinion leaders who are considered to be users with a very high number of followers. We see a similar behavior contagion in our dataset with respect to the Chowkidar movement.
We argue that we can predict the political inclination of a user using just the profile attribute of the users. We further show that the presence of party name in the profile attribute can be considered as an organic behavior and signals support to a party. However, we argue that the addition of election campaign related keywords to the profile is a form of inorganic behavior. The inorganic behavior analysis falls inline with behavior contagion, where the followers tend to adapt to the behavior of their opinion leaders. The “Chowkidar movement” showed a similar effect in the #LokSabhaElectios2019, which was evident by how the other political leaders and followers of BJP party added chowkidar to their profile attributes after @narendramodi did. We thus, argue that people don't shy away from showing support to political parties through profile information.","- Organic: Mentioning party names in profile attributes.

624,How do profile changes vary for influential leads and their followers over the social movement?,"Influential leaders are more likely to change their profile attributes than their followers; the leaders do not change their usernames, while their followers change their usernames a lot; the leaders  tend to make new changes related to previous attribute values, while the followers make comparatively less related changes to previous attribute values.","INSIGHT 1: Political handles are more likely to engage in profile changing behavior as compared to their followers.
In Figure FIGREF15, we plot the number of changes in given attributes over all the snapshots for the users in set $S$. From this plot, we find that not all the attributes are modified at an equal rate. Profile image and Location are the most changed profile attributes and account for nearly $34\%$ and $25\%$ respectively of the total profile changes in our dataset. We analyze the trends in Figure FIGREF12 and find that the political handles do not change their usernames at all. This is in contrast to the trend in Figure FIGREF15 where we see that there are a lot of handles that change their usernames multiple times. The most likely reason for the same is that most of the follower handles are not verified and would not loose their verified status on changing their username.

In this work, we investigate how leveraging historical user preferences can improve generation quality over strong baselines in our setting. We compare our personalized models against two baselines. The first is a name-based Nearest-Neighbor model (NN). We initially adapted the Neural Checklist Model of BIBREF0 as a baseline; however, we ultimately use a simple Encoder-Decoder baseline with ingredient attention (Enc-Dec), which provides comparable performance and lower complexity. All personalized models outperform baseline in BPE perplexity (tab:metricsontest) with Prior Name performing the best. While our models exhibit comparable performance to baseline in BLEU-1/4 and ROUGE-L, we generate more diverse (Distinct-1/2: percentage of distinct unigrams and bigrams) and acceptable recipes. BLEU and ROUGE are not the most appropriate metrics for generation quality. A `correct' recipe can be written in many ways with the same main entities (ingredients). As BLEU-1/4 capture structural information via n-gram matching, they are not correlated with subjective recipe quality. This mirrors observations from BIBREF31, BIBREF8.
We observe that personalized models make more diverse recipes than baseline. They thus perform better in BLEU-1 with more key entities (ingredient mentions) present, but worse in BLEU-4, as these recipes are written in a personalized way and deviate from gold on the phrasal level. Similarly, the `Prior Name' model generates more unigram-diverse recipes than other personalized models and obtains a correspondingly lower BLEU-1 score.
Our model must learn to generate from a diverse recipe space: in our training data, the average recipe length is 117 tokens with a maximum of 256. There are 13K unique ingredients across all recipes. Rare words dominate the vocabulary: 95% of words appear $<$100 times, accounting for only 1.65% of all word usage. As such, we perform Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization BIBREF25, BIBREF26, giving a training vocabulary of 15K tokens across 19M total mentions. User profiles are similarly diverse: 50% of users have consumed $\le $6 recipes, while 10% of users have consumed $>$45 recipes.
Personalization: To measure personalization, we evaluate how closely the generated text corresponds to a particular user profile. We compute the likelihood of generated recipes using identical input specifications but conditioned on ten different user profiles—one `gold' user who consumed the original recipe, and nine randomly generated user profiles. Following BIBREF8, we expect the highest likelihood for the recipe conditioned on the gold user. We measure user matching accuracy (UMA)—the proportion where the gold user is ranked highest—and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) BIBREF32 of the gold user. All personalized models beat baselines in both metrics, showing our models personalize generated recipes to the given user profiles. The Prior Name model achieves the best UMA and MRR by a large margin, revealing that prior recipe names are strong signals for personalization. Moreover, the addition of attention mechanisms to capture these signals improves language modeling performance over a strong non-personalized baseline.","BPE perplexity, BLEU-1/4, ROUGE-L, Distinct-1/2, UMA, MRR, PP.",0.0624999962500002,0.0,0.0624999962500002,4.3339346447573215,34.687164790834736,33.44540434761368,0.1833930704898446,0.0030674846625766,0.5684932470321655,0.6338028169014085,0.5684932470321655,0.5966503024101257

CNN/Daily Mail: Rogue F1 43.85

We report unigram and bigram overlap (ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2) as a means of assessing informativeness and the longest common subsequence (ROUGE-L) as a means of assessing fluency. Table TABREF23 summarizes our results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset. The first block in the table includes the results of an extractive Oracle system as an upper bound. We also present the Lead-3 baseline (which simply selects the first three sentences in a document). The second block in the table includes various extractive models trained on the CNN/DailyMail dataset (see Section SECREF5 for an overview). For comparison to our own model, we also implemented a non-pretrained Transformer baseline (TransformerExt) which uses the same architecture as BertSumExt, but with fewer parameters. It is randomly initialized and only trained on the summarization task. TransformerExt has 6 layers, the hidden size is 512, and the feed-forward filter size is 2,048. The model was trained with same settings as in BIBREF3. The third block in Table TABREF23 highlights the performance of several abstractive models on the CNN/DailyMail dataset (see Section SECREF6 for an overview). We also include an abstractive Transformer baseline (TransformerAbs) which has the same decoder as our abstractive BertSum models; the encoder is a 6-layer Transformer with 768 hidden size and 2,048 feed-forward filter size. The fourth block reports results with fine-tuned Bert models: BertSumExt and its two variants (one without interval embeddings, and one with the large version of Bert), BertSumAbs, and BertSumExtAbs. Bert-based models outperform the Lead-3 baseline which is not a strawman; on the CNN/DailyMail corpus it is indeed superior to several extractive BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF19 and abstractive models BIBREF6. Bert models collectively outperform all previously proposed extractive and abstractive systems, only falling behind the Oracle upper bound. Among Bert variants, BertSumExt performs best which is not entirely surprising; CNN/DailyMail summaries are somewhat extractive and even abstractive models are prone to copying sentences from the source document when trained on this dataset BIBREF6. Perhaps unsurprisingly we observe that larger versions of Bert lead to performance improvements and that interval embeddings bring only slight gains. Table TABREF24 presents results on the NYT dataset. Following the evaluation protocol in BIBREF27, we use limited-length ROUGE Recall, where predicted summaries are truncated to the length of the gold summaries. Again, we report the performance of the Oracle upper bound and Lead-3 baseline. The second block in the table contains previously proposed extractive models as well as our own Transformer baseline. Compress BIBREF27 is an ILP-based model which combines compression and anaphoricity constraints. The third block includes abstractive models from the literature, and our Transformer baseline. Bert-based models are shown in the fourth block. Again, we observe that they outperform previously proposed approaches. On this dataset, abstractive Bert models generally perform better compared to BertSumExt, almost approaching Oracle performance.
Table TABREF26 summarizes our results on the XSum dataset. Recall that summaries in this dataset are highly abstractive (see Table TABREF12) consisting of a single sentence conveying the gist of the document. Extractive models here perform poorly as corroborated by the low performance of the Lead baseline (which simply selects the leading sentence from the document), and the Oracle (which selects a single-best sentence in each document) in Table TABREF26. As a result, we do not report results for extractive models on this dataset. The second block in Table TABREF26 presents the results of various abstractive models taken from BIBREF22 and also includes our own abstractive Transformer baseline. In the third block we show the results of our Bert summarizers which again are superior to all previously reported models (by a wide margin).

Assume $x_{ik}\in X_{i}$ denotes the likelihood that the $\emph {i}^{th}$ tweet account favors $\emph {k}^{th}$ topic in the dataset. Our topic based features can be calculated as below.
Global Outlier Standard Score measures the degree that a user's tweet content is related to a certain topic compared to the other users. Specifically, the ""GOSS"" score of user $i$ on topic $k$ can be calculated as Eq.( 12 ):
Local Outlier Standard Score measures the degree of interest someone shows to a certain topic by considering his own homepage content only. For instance, the ""LOSS"" score of account $i$ on topic $k$ can be calculated as Eq.( 13 ):
Three baseline classification methods: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Adaboost, and Random Forests are adopted to evaluate our extracted features. We test each classification algorithm with scikit-learn BIBREF9 and run a 10-fold cross validation.

638,How does their simple voting scheme work?,"Among all the classes predicted by several models, for each test sentence, class with most votes are picked. In case of a tie, one of the most frequent classes are picked randomly.","Finally, we combine our CNN and RNN models using a voting process. For each sentence in the test set, we apply several CNN and RNN models presented in Tables TABREF12 and TABREF14 and predict the class with the most votes. In case of a tie, we pick one of the most frequent classes randomly. The combination achieves an F1 score of 84.9 which is better than the performance of the two NN types alone. It, thus, confirms our assumption that the networks provide complementary information: while the RNN computes a weighted combination of all words in the sentence, the CNN extracts the most informative n-grams for the relation and only considers their resulting activations.","They apply multiple CNN and RNN models to each sentence, then pick the class with the most votes.

639,How do they obtain the new context represetation?,"They use two independent convolutional and max-pooling layers on (1) a combination of the left context, the left entity and the middle context; and (2) a combination of the middle context, the right entity and the right context. They concatenated the two results after pooling to get the new context representation.","(1) We propose extended middle context, a new context representation for CNNs for relation classification. The extended middle context uses all parts of the sentence (the relation arguments, left of the relation arguments, between the arguments, right of the arguments) and pays special attention to the middle part.
One of our contributions is a new input representation especially designed for relation classification. The contexts are split into three disjoint regions based on the two relation arguments: the left context, the middle context and the right context. Since in most cases the middle context contains the most relevant information for the relation, we want to focus on it but not ignore the other regions completely. Hence, we propose to use two contexts: (1) a combination of the left context, the left entity and the middle context; and (2) a combination of the middle context, the right entity and the right context. Due to the repetition of the middle context, we force the network to pay special attention to it. The two contexts are processed by two independent convolutional and max-pooling layers. After pooling, the results are concatenated to form the sentence representation. Figure FIGREF3 depicts this procedure. It shows an examplary sentence: “He had chest pain and <e1>headaches</e1> from <e2>mold</e2> in the bedroom.” If we only considered the middle context “from”, the network might be tempted to predict a relation like Entity-Origin(e1,e2). However, by also taking the left and right context into account, the model can detect the relation Cause-Effect(e2,e1). While this could also be achieved by integrating the whole context into the model, using the whole context can have disadvantages for longer sentences: The max pooling step can easily choose a value from a part of the sentence which is far away from the mention of the relation. With splitting the context into two parts, we reduce this danger. Repeating the middle context increases the chance for the max pooling step to pick a value from the middle context.",By splitting the context into three disjoint regions and combining them in two different ways.,0.1777777733333334,0.0,0.133333328888889,0.9039012350059876,25.29605797916261,21.53718820193102,0.0539568345323741,0.0031152647975077,0.4729077816009521,0.5282905007120948,0.4701365530490875,0.4944098591804504
640,"What is an unordered text document, do these arise in real-world corpora?","A unordered text document is one where sentences in the document are disordered or jumbled. It doesn't appear that unordered text documents appear in corpora, but rather are introduced as part of processing pipeline.","To structure an unordered document is an essential task in many applications. It is a post-requisite for applications like multiple document extractive text summarization where we have to present a summary of multiple documents. It is a prerequisite for applications like question answering from multiple documents where we have to present an answer by processing multiple documents. In this paper, we address the task of segmenting an unordered text document into different sections. The input document/summary that may have unordered sentences is processed so that it will have sentences clustered together. Clustering is based on the similarity with the respective keyword as well as with the sentences belonging to the same cluster. Keywords are identified and clusters are formed for each keyword.
To test our approach, we jumble the ordering of sentences in a document, process the unordered document and compare the similarity of the output document with the original document.","An unordered text document is a document with sentences in random order.

Observe that the pre-trained embeddings (FastText or BERT) outperform TF-IDF vector representation. In row r2, we apply logistic regression classifier with BERTSentEmb that leads to improved scores over FastTextSentEmb. Subsequently, we augment the sentence vector with additional features that improves F1 on dev (external), however not dev (internal). Next, we initialize CNN by FastTextWordEmb or BERTWordEmb and augment the last hidden layer (before classification) with BERTSentEmb and feature vectors, leading to gains in F1 for both the dev sets. Further, we fine-tune BERT and apply different thresholds in relaxing the decision boundary, where $\tau \ge 0.35$ is found optimal.
We choose the three different models in the ensemble: Logistic Regression, CNN and BERT on fold1 and subsequently an ensemble+ of r3, r6 and r12 from each fold1-5 (i.e., 15 models) to obtain predictions for dev (external). We investigate different ensemble schemes (r17-r19), where we observe that the relax-voting improves recall and therefore, the higher F1 (i.e., 0.673). In postprocess step, we check for repetition propaganda technique by computing cosine similarity between the current sentence and its preceding $w=10$ sentence vectors (i.e., BERTSentEmb) in the document. If the cosine-similarity is greater than $\lambda \in \lbrace .99, .95\rbrace $, then the current sentence is labeled as propaganda due to repetition. Comparing r19 and r21, we observe a gain in recall, however an overall decrease in F1 applying postprocess.

Can we transfer linguistic knowledge learned by English pre-trained models to other languages? In this work, we develop a technique to rapidly transfer an existing pre-trained model from English to other languages in an energy efficient way BIBREF8. As the first step, we focus on building a bilingual language model (LM) of English and a target language. Starting from a pre-trained English LM, we learn the target language specific parameters (i.e., word embeddings), while keeping the encoder layers of the pre-trained English LM fixed. We then fine-tune both English and target model to obtain the bilingual LM.

654,How was the StackExchange dataset collected?,They obtained computer science related topics by looking at titles and user-assigned tags.,"Inspired by the StackLite tag recommendation task on Kaggle, we build a new benchmark based on the public StackExchange data. We use questions with titles as source, and user-assigned tags as target keyphrases.
Since oftentimes the questions on StackExchange contain less information than in scientific publications, there are fewer keyphrases per data point in StackEx. Furthermore, StackExchange uses a tag recommendation system that suggests topic-relevant tags to users while submitting questions; therefore, we are more likely to see general terminology such as Linux and Java. This characteristic challenges models with respect to their ability to distill major topics of a question rather than selecting specific snippets from the text.","Questions with titles were used as source, and user-assigned tags as target keyphrases.",0.3199999950080001,0.1666666616666668,0.3199999950080001,11.183046657879292,37.702635900909485,34.32142643738694,0.3163120567375886,0.010717230008244,0.4841611683368683,0.5601619626166391,0.4841611385345459,0.5893185138702393

658,What is the McGurk effect?,"A perceptual illusion, where listening to a speech sound while watching a mouth pronounce a different sound changes how the audio is heard.","For the McGurk effect, we attempt an illusion for a language token (e.g. phoneme, word, sentence) $x$ by creating a video where an audio stream of $x$ is visually dubbed over by a person saying $x^{\prime }\ne x$ . We stress that the audio portion of the illusion is not modified and corresponds to a person saying $x$ . The illusion $f(x^{\prime },x)$ affects a listener if they perceive what is being said to be $y\ne x$ if they watched the illusory video whereas they perceive $x$ if they had either listened to the audio stream without watching the video or had watched the original unaltered video, depending on specification. We call a token illusionable if an illusion can be made for the token that affects the perception of a significant fraction of people.
In this work, we attempt to understand how susceptible humans' perceptual systems for natural speech are to carefully designed “adversarial attacks.” We investigate the density of certain classes of illusion, that is, the fraction of natural language utterances whose comprehension can be affected by the illusion. Our study centers around the McGurk effect, which is the well-studied phenomenon by which the perception of what we hear can be influenced by what we see BIBREF0 . A prototypical example is that the audio of the phoneme “baa,” accompanied by a video of someone mouthing “vaa”, can be perceived as “vaa” or “gaa” (Figure 1 ).

662,How better does new approach behave than existing solutions?,"On Coin Collector, proposed model finds shorter path in fewer number of interactions with enironment.
On Cooking World, proposed model uses smallest amount of steps and on average has bigger score and number of wins by significant margin.","In this setting, we compare the number of actions played in the environment (frames) and the score achieved by the agent (i.e. +1 reward if the coin is collected). In Go-Explore we also count the actions used to restore the environment to a selected cell, i.e. to bring the agent to the state represented in the selected cell. This allows a one-to-one comparison of the exploration efficiency between Go-Explore and algorithms that use a count-based reward in text-based games. Importantly, BIBREF8 showed that DQN and DRQN, without such counting rewards, could never find a successful trajectory in hard games such as the ones used in our experiments. Figure FIGREF17 shows the number of interactions with the environment (frames) versus the maximum score obtained, averaged over 10 games of the same difficulty. As shown by BIBREF8, DRQN++ finds a trajectory with the maximum score faster than to DQN++. On the other hand, phase 1 of Go-Explore finds an optimal trajectory with approximately half the interactions with the environment. Moreover, the trajectory length found by Go-Explore is always optimal (i.e. 30 steps) whereas both DQN++ and DRQN++ have an average length of 38 and 42 respectively.

All results are averaged over 15 runs ± one standard deviation. The numbers in parentheses next to the dataset names indicate the size of the datasets. For example, (40+2) denotes 40 training instances and 2 validation instances per class.
Table TABREF26 shows the manipulation results on text classification. For data augmentation, our approach significantly improves over the base model on all the three datasets. Besides, compared to both the conventional synonym substitution and the approach that keeps the augmentation network fixed, our adaptive method that fine-tunes the augmentation network jointly with model training achieves superior results. Indeed, the heuristic-based synonym approach can sometimes harm the model performance (e.g., SST-5 and IMDB), as also observed in previous work BIBREF19, BIBREF18. This can be because the heuristic rules do not fit the task or datasets well. In contrast, learning-based augmentation has the advantage of adaptively generating useful samples to improve model training.
Table TABREF29 shows the classification results on SST-2 with varying imbalance ratios. We can see our data weighting performs best across all settings. In particular, the improvement over the base model increases as the data gets more imbalanced, ranging from around 6 accuracy points on 100:1000 to over 20 accuracy points on 20:1000. Our method is again consistently better than BIBREF4, validating that the parametric treatment is beneficial.

671,How is pseudo-perplexity defined?,Answer with content missing: (formulas in selection): Pseudo-perplexity is perplexity where conditional joint probability is approximated.,"The goal of an language model is to assign meaningful probabilities to a sequence of words. Given a set of tokens $\mathbf {X}=(x_1,....,x_T)$, where $T$ is the length of a sequence, our task is to estimate the joint conditional probability $P(\mathbf {X})$ which is
were $(x_{1}, \ldots , x_{i-1})$ is the context. An Intrinsic evaluation of the performance of Language Models is perplexity (PPL) which is defined as the inverse probability of the set of the tokens and taking the $T^{th}$ root were $T$ is the number of tokens
BERT's bi-directional context poses a problem for us to calculate an auto-regressive joint probability. A simple fix could be that we mask all the tokens $\mathbf {x}_{>i}$ and we calculate the conditional factors as we do for an unidirectional model. By doing so though, we loose upon the advantage of bi-directional context the BERT model enables. We propose an approximation of the joint probability as,

673,How is the data used for training annotated?,The number of redundant answers to collect from the crowd is predicted to efficiently capture the diversity of all answers from all visual questions.,"FLOAT SELECTED: Fig. 6: We propose a novel application of predicting the number of redundant answers to collect from the crowd per visual question to efficiently capture the diversity of all answers for all visual questions. (a) For a batch of visual questions, our system first produces a relative ordering using the predicted confidence in whether a crowd would agree on an answer (upper half). Then, the system allocates a minimum number of annotations to all visual questions (bottom, left half) and then the extra available human budget to visual questions most confidently predicted to lead to crowd disagreement (bottom, right half). (b) For 121,512 visual questions, we show results for our system, a related VQA algorithm, and today’s status quo of random predictions. Boundary conditions are one answer (leftmost) and five answers (rightmost) for all visual questions. Our approach typically accelerates the capture of answer diversity by over 20% from today’s Status Quo selection; e.g., 21% for 70% of the answer diversity and 23% for 86% of the answer diversity.

675,What can word subspace represent?,"Word vectors, usually in the context of others within the same class.","To tackle this problem, we introduce the novel concept of word subspace. It is mathematically defined as a low dimensional linear subspace in a word vector space with high dimensionality. Given that words from texts of the same class belong to the same context, it is possible to model word vectors of each class as word subspaces and efficiently compare them in terms of similarity by using canonical angles between the word subspaces. Through this representation, most of the variability of the class is retained. Consequently, a word subspace can effectively and compactly represent the context of the corresponding text. We achieve this framework through the mutual subspace method (MSM) BIBREF9 .",The context of a text.,0.2499999957031251,0.1333333294222223,0.2499999957031251,6.285596338261262,39.09799661285648,36.36032254367516,0.2391098484848484,0.005524861878453,0.4284649789333343,0.6552985334396362,0.4284648895263672,

Another model (ELMo Only) is to initialize the word embeddings of the base model using the pre-trained ELMo model, and here no topic information was added. Here we have higher scores than Topic Only, and the accuracy and F1 score increased by 9.87% and 12.26% respectively compared with the base model. We then conducted a combination of both(ELMo+Topic), where the word embeddings from the sentences were computed from the pre-trained ELMo model, and the topic representations were from the pre-trained Doc2vec model.

677,How big is dataset for testing?,"30 terms, each term-sanse pair has around 15 samples for testing.","Our testing dataset takes MIMIC-III BIBREF18 and PubMed as data sources. Here we are referring to all the notes data from MIMIC-III (NOTEEVENTS table ) and Case Reports articles from PubMed, as these contents are close to medical notes. To create the test set, we first followed the approach by BIBREF6 who applied an auto-generating method. Initially, we built a term-sense dictionary from the training dataset. Then we did matching for the sense words or phrases in the MIMIC-III notes dataset, and once there is a match, we replaced the words or phrases with the abbreviation term . We then asked two researchers with a medical background to check the matched samples manually with the following judgment: given this sentence and the abbreviation term and its sense, do you think the content is enough for you to guess the sense and whether this is the right sense? To estimate the agreement on the annotations, we selected a subset which contains 120 samples randomly and let the two annotators annotate individually. We got a Kappa score BIBREF27 of 0.96, which is considered as a near perfect agreement. We then distributed the work to the two annotators, and each of them labeled a half of the dataset, which means each sample was only labeled by a single annotator. For some rare term-sense pairs, we failed to find samples from MIMIC-III. The annotators then searched these senses via PubMed data source manually, aiming to find clinical notes-like sentences. They picked good sentences from these results as testing samples where the keywords exist and the content is informative. For those senses that are extremely rare, we let the annotators create sentences in the clinical note style as testing samples according to their experiences. Eventually, we have a balanced testing dataset, where each term-sense pair has around 15 samples for testing (on average, each pair has 14.56 samples and the median sample number is 15), and a comparison with training dataset is shown in Figure FIGREF11. Due to the difficulty for collecting the testing dataset, we decided to only collect for a random selection of 30 terms.

Out of those, 34 had verified accounts, and the rest were unverified. From the 48 unverified accounts, 6 have been suspended by Twitter at the date of writing, 3 tried to imitate legitimate accounts of others, and 4 accounts have been already deleted. Figure FIGREF28 shows the proportion of verified accounts to unverified accounts for viral tweets (containing fake news vs. not containing fake news). From the chart, it is clear that there is a higher chance of fake news coming from unverified accounts.
A useful representation for friends and followers is the ratio between friends/followers. Figures FIGREF31 and FIGREF32 show this representation. Notice that accounts spreading viral tweets with fake news have, on average, a larger ratio of friends/followers. The distribution of those accounts not generating fake news is more evenly distributed.
Figure FIGREF24 shows that, in contrast to other kinds of viral tweets, those containing fake news were created more recently. As such, Twitter users were exposed to fake news related to the election for a shorter period of time.","Unverified accounts with a larger ratio of friends/followers, created more recently.",0.2142857095153062,0.0,0.0714285666581635,8.638804535733374,55.04675356385341,46.56765607898225,0.217391304347826,0.0068280571073867,0.7155768871307373,0.7851636623117058,0.7155769467353821,0.8917917013168335

SQuAD is much larger in size although questions in this corpus are often paraphrased multiple times. On the contrary, SQuAD's average candidates per question ( INLINEFORM0 ) is the smallest because SQuAD extracts answer candidates from paragraphs whereas the others extract them from sections or infoboxes that consist of bigger contexts. Although InfoboxQA is larger than WikiQA or SelQA, the number of token types ( INLINEFORM1 ) in InfoboxQA is smaller than those two, due to the repetitive nature of infoboxes.
All corpora show similar average answer candidate lengths ( INLINEFORM0 ), except for InfoboxQA where each line in the infobox is considered a candidate. SelQA and SQuAD show similar average question lengths ( INLINEFORM1 ) because of the similarity between their annotation schemes. It is not surprising that WikiQA's average question length is the smallest, considering their questions are taken from search queries. InfoboxQA's average question length is relatively small, due to the restricted information that can be asked from the infoboxes.

691,IS the graph representation supervised?,"The graph representation appears to be semi-supervised. It is included in the learning pipeline for the medical recommendation, where the attention model is learned. (There is some additional evidence that is unavailable in parsed text)","FLOAT SELECTED: Figure 2: The framework of G-BERT. It consists of three main parts: ontology embedding, BERT and fine-tuned classifier. Firstly, we derive ontology embedding for medical code laid in leaf nodes by cooperating ancestors information by Eq. 1 and 2 based on graph attention networks (Eq. 3, 4). Then we input set of diagnosis and medication ontology embedding separately to shared weight BERT which is pretrained using Eq. 6, 7, 8. Finally, we concatenate the mean of all previous visit embeddings and the last visit embedding as input and fine-tune the prediction layers using Eq. 10 for medication recommendation tasks.
We adapted the original BERT model to be more suitable for our data and task. In particular, we pre-train the model on each EHR visit (within both single-visit EHR sequences and multi-visit EHR sequences). We modified the input and pre-training objectives of the BERT model: (1) For the input, we built the Transformer encoder on the GNN outputs, i.e. ontology embeddings, for visit embedding. For the original EHR sequence, it means essentially we combine the GNN model with a Transformer to become a new integrated encoder. In addition, we removed the position embedding as we explained before. (2) As for the pre-training procedures, we modified the original pre-training tasks i.e., Masked LM (language model) task and Next Sentence prediction task to self-prediction task and dual-prediction task. The idea to conduct these tasks is to make the visit embedding absorb enough information about what it is made of and what it is able to predict.
Thus, for the self-prediction task, we want the visit embedding $v^1_\ast $ to recover what it is made of, i.e., the input medical codes $\mathcal {C}_\ast ^t$ for each visit as follows:
$$\begin{aligned} &\mathcal {L}_{se}(\mathbf {v}^1_\ast , \mathcal {C}_\ast ^1) = -\log p(\mathcal {C}_\ast ^1 | \mathbf {v}^1_\ast ) \\ & = - \sum _{c \in \mathcal {C}_\ast ^1}\log p(c_\ast ^1 | \mathbf {v}^1_\ast ) + \sum _{c \in \mathcal {C}_\ast \setminus \mathcal {C}_\ast ^1}\log p(c_\ast ^1 | \mathbf {v}^1_\ast ) \end{aligned}$$ (Eq. 19)
Likewise, for the dual-prediction task, since the visit embedding $\mathbf {v}_\ast $ carries the information of medical codes of type $\ast $ , we can further expect it has the ability to do more task-specific prediction as follows:
$$\begin{aligned} \mathcal {L}_{du} = -\log p(\mathcal {C}_d^1 | \mathbf {v}_m^1) - \log p(\mathcal {C}_m^1 | \mathbf {v}_d^1) \end{aligned}$$ (Eq. 20)

694,What is the difference of the proposed model with a standard RNN encoder-decoder?,"Introduce a ""Refinement Adjustment LSTM-based component"" to the decoder.","While the RNN-based generators with DA gating-vector can prevent the undesirable semantic repetitions, the ARED-based generators show signs of better adapting to a new domain. However, none of the models show significant advantage from out-of-domain data. To better analyze model generalization to an unseen, new domain as well as model leveraging the out-of-domain sources, we propose a new architecture which is an extension of the ARED model. In order to better select, aggregate and control the semantic information, a Refinement Adjustment LSTM-based component (RALSTM) is introduced to the decoder side. The proposed model can learn from unaligned data by jointly training the sentence planning and surface realization to produce natural language sentences. We conducted experiments on four different NLG domains and found that the proposed methods significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods regarding BLEU BIBREF15 and slot error rate ERR scores BIBREF4 .

Manual: Mean Opinion Score (MOS)","To compare the conversions between USVC and PitchNet, we employed an automatic evaluation score and a human evaluation score.
The automatic score roughly followed the design in BIBREF13. The pitch tracker of librosa package BIBREF18 was employed to extract pitch information of the input and output audio. Then the output pitch was compared to the input pitch using the normalized cross correlation (NCC) which would give a score between 0 and 1. The higher the score is, the better the output pitch matches the input pitch. We conducted the evaluation on USVC (our) and PitchNet. The evaluated automatic scores on conversion and reconstruction tasks are shown in Tab. TABREF14. Our method performed better both on conversion and reconstruction. The scores of reconstruction are higher than conversion since both models were trained using a reconstruction loss. However, the score of our method on conversion is even higher than the score of USVC (Our) on reconstruction.
Mean Opinion Score (MOS) was used as a subjective metric to evaluate the quality of the converted audio. Two questions were asked: (1) what is quality of the audio? (naturalness) (2) How well does the converted version match the original? (similarity) A score of 1-5 would be given to answer the questions. The evaluation was conducted on USVC (Our) and PitchNet. Besides, the converted samples provided by BIBREF0 was also included to give a more convincing evaluation. As shown by Tab.

Our BT-ES and BT-FI variants close this gap by training on a machine translated English version of the training set generated through back-translation. As shown in Table TABREF9, this brings substantial gains for both Roberta and XLM-R, with an average improvement of 4.6 points in the best case.

Number of MP iterations. First, we varied the number of message passing iterations from 1 to 4. We can clearly see in Table TABREF29 that having more iterations improves performance. We attribute this to the fact that we are reading out at each iteration from 1 to $T$ (see Eq. DISPLAY_FORM18), which enables the final graph representation to encode a mixture of low-level and high-level features. Indeed, in initial experiments involving readout at $t$=$T$ only, setting $T\ge 2$ was always decreasing performance, despite the GRU-based updates (Eq. DISPLAY_FORM14). These results were consistent with that of BIBREF53 and BIBREF9, who both are reading out only at $t$=$T$ too. We hypothesize that node features at $T\ge 2$ are too diffuse to be entirely relied upon during readout. More precisely, initially at $t$=0, node representations capture information about words, at $t$=1, about their 1-hop neighborhood (bigrams), at $t$=2, about compositions of bigrams, etc. Thus, pretty quickly, node features become general and diffuse. In such cases, considering also the lower-level, more precise features of the earlier iterations when reading out may be necessary.

702,What is the message passing framework?,It is a framework used to describe algorithms for neural networks represented as graphs. Main idea is that that representation of each vertex is updated based on messages from its neighbors.,"The MP framework is based on the core idea of recursive neighborhood aggregation. That is, at every iteration, the representation of each vertex is updated based on messages received from its neighbors. All spectral GNNs can be described in terms of the MP framework.
GNNs have been applied with great success to bioinformatics and social network data, for node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. However, a few studies only have focused on the application of the MP framework to representation learning on text. This paper proposes one such application. More precisely, we represent documents as word co-occurrence networks, and develop an expressive MP GNN tailored to document understanding, the Message Passing Attention network for Document understanding (MPAD). We also propose several hierarchical variants of MPAD. Evaluation on 10 document classification datasets show that our architectures learn representations that are competitive with the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, ablation experiments shed light on the impact of various architectural choices.
The concept of message passing over graphs has been around for many years BIBREF0, BIBREF1, as well as that of graph neural networks (GNNs) BIBREF2, BIBREF3. However, GNNs have only recently started to be closely investigated, following the advent of deep learning. Some notable examples include BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10, BIBREF11, BIBREF12. These approaches are known as spectral.

704,What approaches do they use towards text analysis?,"Modeling considerations:  the variables (both predictors and outcomes)  are rarely simply binary or categorical;  using a particular classification scheme means deciding which variations are visible,; Supervised and unsupervised learning are the most common approaches to learning from data;  the unit of text that we are labeling (or annotating, or coding), either automatic or manual, can sometimes be different than one's final unit of analysis.","In this phase we develop measures (or, “operationalizations”, or “indicators”) for the concepts of interest, a process called “operationalization”. Regardless of whether we are working with computers, the output produced coincides with Adcock and Collier's “scores”—the concrete translation and output of the systematized concept into numbers or labels BIBREF13 . Choices made during this phase are always tied to the question “Are we measuring what we intend to measure?” Does our operationalization match our conceptual definition? To ensure validity we must recognize gaps between what is important and what is easy to measure. We first discuss modeling considerations. Next, we describe several frequently used computational approaches and their limitations and strengths.
Modeling considerations
The variables (both predictors and outcomes) are rarely simply binary or categorical. For example, a study on language use and age could focus on chronological age (instead of, e.g., social age BIBREF19 ). However, even then, age can be modeled in different ways. Discretization can make the modeling easier and various NLP studies have modeled age as a categorical variable BIBREF20 . But any discretization raises questions: How many categories? Where to place the boundaries? Fine distinctions might not always be meaningful for the analysis we are interested in, but categories that are too broad can threaten validity. Other interesting variables include time, space, and even the social network position of the author. It is often preferable to keep the variable in its most precise form. For example, BIBREF21 perform exploration in the context of hypothesis testing by using latitude and longitude coordinates — the original metadata attached to geotagged social media such as tweets — rather than aggregating into administrative units such as counties or cities. This is necessary when such administrative units are unlikely to be related to the target concept, as is the case in their analysis of dialect differences. Focusing on precise geographical coordinates also makes it possible to recognize fine-grained effects, such as language variation across the geography of a city.
Using a particular classification scheme means deciding which variations are visible, and which ones are hidden BIBREF22 . We are looking for a categorization scheme for which it is feasible to collect a large enough labeled document collection (e.g., to train supervised models), but which is also fine-grained enough for our purposes. Classification schemes rarely exhibit the ideal properties, i.e., that they are consistent, their categories are mutually exclusive, and that the system is complete BIBREF22 . Borderline cases are challenging, especially with social and cultural concepts, where the boundaries are often not clear-cut. The choice of scheme can also have ethical implications BIBREF22 . For example, gender is usually represented as a binary variable in NLP and computational models tend to learn gender-stereotypical patterns. The operationalization of gender in NLP has been challenged only recently BIBREF23 , BIBREF24 , BIBREF25 .
Supervised and unsupervised learning are the most common approaches to learning from data. With supervised learning, a model learns from labeled data (e.g., social media messages labeled by sentiment) to infer (or predict) these labels from unlabeled texts. In contrast, unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data. Supervised approaches are especially suitable when we have a clear definition of the concept of interest and when labels are available (either annotated or native to the data). Unsupervised approaches, such as topic models, are especially useful for exploration. In this setting, conceptualization and operationalization may occur simultaneously, with theory emerging from the data BIBREF26 . Unsupervised approaches are also used when there is a clear way of measuring a concept, often based on strong assumptions. For example, BIBREF3 measure “surprise” in an analysis of Darwin's reading decisions based on the divergence between two probability distributions.
From an analysis perspective, the unit of text that we are labeling (or annotating, or coding), either automatic or manual, can sometimes be different than one's final unit of analysis. For example, if in a study on media frames in news stories, the theoretical framework and research question point toward frames at the story level (e.g., what is the overall causal analysis of the news article?), the story must be the unit of analysis. Yet it is often difficult to validly and reliably code a single frame at the story level. Multiple perspectives are likely to sit side-by-side in a story. Thus, an article on income inequality might point to multiple causes, such as globalization, education, and tax policies. Coding at the sentence level would detect each of these causal explanations individually, but this information would need to be somehow aggregated to determine the overall story-level frame. Sometimes scholars solve this problem by only examining headlines and lead paragraphs, arguing that based on journalistic convention, the most important information can be found at the beginning of a story. However, this leads to a return to a shorter, less nuanced analysis.
From a computational perspective, the unit of text can also make a huge difference, especially when we are using bag-of-words models, where word order within a unit does not matter. Small segments, like tweets, sometimes do not have enough information to make their semantic context clear. In contrast, larger segments, like novels, have too much variation, making it difficult to train focused models. Finding a good segmentation sometimes means combining short documents and subdividing long documents. The word “document"" can therefore be misleading. But it is so ingrained in the common NLP lexicon that we use it anyway in this article.
For insight-driven text analysis, it is often critical that high-level patterns can be communicated. Furthermore, interpretable models make it easier to find spurious features, to do error analysis, and to support interpretation of results. Some approaches are effective for prediction, but harder to interpret. The value we place on interpretability can therefore influence the approach we choose. There is an increasing interest in developing interpretable or transparent models in the NLP and machine learning communities.",Supervised and unsupervised learning.,0.1403508758879655,0.0923076914272189,0.1403508758879655,3.100137728905924,30.383282138920208,28.24380842943252,0.063083451202263,0.0006553079947575,0.5531967282295227,1.0,0.5531967282295227,0.4723627269268036
