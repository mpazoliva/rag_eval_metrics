For example, prior work has shown that the mouth movements reflect articulatory features of speech segments and durational information, while pitch and speech amplitude are primarily cued by eyebrow and head movements. Little is known about how the visual perception of segmental and prosodic speech information is influenced by linguistic experience. Using eye-tracking, we studied how perceivers' visual scanning of different regions on a talking face predicts accuracy in a task targeting both segmental versus prosodic information, and also asked how this was influenced by language familiarity. Twenty-four native English perceivers heard two audio sentences in either English or Mandarin (an unfamiliar, non-native language), which sometimes differed in segmental or prosodic information (or both). Perceivers then saw a silent video of a talking face, and judged whether that video matched either the first or second audio sentence (or whether both sentences were the same). First, increased looking to the mouth predicted correct responses only for non-native language trials. Second, the start of a successful search for speech information in the mouth area was significantly delayed in non-native versus native trials, but just when there were only prosodic differences in the auditory sentences, and not when there were segmental differences. Third, (in correct trials) the saccade amplitude in native language trials was significantly greater than in non-native trials, indicating more intensely focused fixations in the latter.

The craniofacial relationship in patients with dentofacial deformities is still not understood, and transformations between facial and skeletal shapes remain a challenging task due to intricate anatomical structures and nonlinear relationships between the facial soft tissue and bones. In this study, a novel bidirectional 3-dimensional (3D) deep learning framework, named P2P-ConvGC, was developed and validated based on a large-scale data set for accurate subject-specific transformations between facial and skeletal shapes. Specifically, the 2-stage point-sampling strategy was used to generate multiple nonoverlapping point subsets to represent high-resolution facial and skeletal shapes. Facial and skeletal point subsets were separately input into the prediction system to predict the corresponding skeletal and facial point subsets via the skeletal prediction subnetwork and facial prediction subnetwork. For quantitative evaluation, the accuracy was calculated with shape errors and landmark errors between the predicted skeleton or face with corresponding ground truths. The shape error was calculated by comparing the predicted point sets with the ground truths, with P2P-ConvGC outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms including P2P-Net, P2P-ASNL, and P2P-Conv. The total landmark errors (Euclidean distances of craniomaxillofacial landmarks) of P2P-ConvGC in the upper skull, mandible, and facial soft tissues were 1.964 ± 0.904 mm, 2.398 ± 1.174 mm, and 2.226 ± 0.774 mm, respectively. Furthermore, the clinical feasibility of the bidirectional model was validated using a clinical cohort. The result demonstrated its prediction ability with average surface deviation errors of 0.895 ± 0.175 mm for facial prediction and 0.906 ± 0.082 mm for skeletal prediction. To conclude, our proposed model achieved good performance on the subject-specific prediction of facial and skeletal shapes and showed clinical application potential in postoperative facial prediction and VSP for orthognathic surgery.',)",1.0,0.024670109007458405,0.011340505961035184,0.09502262443438914,0.005376344086021506,0.01015228426395939

In the early stages of colonization, plasticity can facilitate persistence in a novel environment; but over evolutionary time, processes such as genetic assimilation may reduce variation in plastic traits such that species with a longer evolutionary history in an environment can show lower levels of plasticity than recent invaders. Therefore, comparing species in the early stages of colonization to long-established species provides a powerful approach for uncovering the role of phenotypic plasticity during different stages of colonization. We compared gene expression between low-dissolved oxygen (DO) and high-DO populations of two cyprinid fish: Enteromius apleurogramma, a species that has undergone a recent range expansion, and E.\u2009neumayeri, a long-established native species in the same region. We sampled tissue either immediately after capture from the field or after a 2-week acclimation under high-DO conditions, allowing us to test for both evolved and plastic differences in low-DO vs high-DO populations of each species. We found that most genes showing candidate-evolved differences in gene expression did not overlap with those showing plastic differences in gene expression. However, in the genes that did overlap, there was counter-gradient variation such that plastic and evolved gene expression responses were in opposite directions in both species. Additionally, E.\u2009apleurogramma had higher levels of plasticity and evolved divergence in gene expression between field populations. We suggest that the higher level of plasticity and counter-gradient variation may have allowed rapid genetic adaptation in E.\u2009apleurogramma and facilitated colonization.

Next, we conducted comparative proteomics and metabolomics to dissect the complex salt-stress response mechanisms. A total of 314 proteins and 649 metabolites were identified to be differentially behaving upon NaCl treatment. Functional classification and enrichment analysis unravelled that many differential proteins were proteases associated with photosynthesis. Through metabolic pathway enrichment, several energy-related pathways were found to be altered, such as the biosynthesis and degradation of branched-chain amino acids, and our network analysis showed that many ribosomal proteins were involved in these metabolic adaptations. Taken together, for hemp plants, influences on chloroplast function probably represent a major toxic effect of salinity, and modulating several energy-producing pathways possibly through translational regulation is presumably a key protective mechanism against the negative impacts. Our data and analyses provide insights into our understanding of hemp's stress biology and may lay a foundation for future functional genomics studies.",1.0,0.016979445933869526,0.012424338961452692,0.1150442477876106,0.007444168734491316,0.009628610729023384

Soil salinity affects many physiological processes of plants and leads to crop yield losses worldwide. For hemp, a crop that is valued for multiple aspects, such as its medical compounds, fibre, and seed, a comprehensive understanding of its salt stress responses is a prerequisite for resistance breeding and tailoring its agronomic performance to suit certain industrial applications. Here, we first observed the phenotype of salt-stressed hemp plants and found that under NaCl treatment, hemp plants displayed pronounced growth defects, as indicated by the significantly reduced average height, number of leaves, and chlorophyll content.
