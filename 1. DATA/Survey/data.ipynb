It divides the task of interpreting commands for behavioral navigation into two steps: path generation, and path verification. For path generation, this baseline uses a standard sequence-to-sequence model augmented with an attention mechanism, similar to BIBREF23 , BIBREF6 . For path verification, the baseline uses depth-first search to find a route in the graph that matches the sequence of predicted behaviors. If no route matches perfectly, the baseline changes up to three behaviors in the predicted sequence to try to turn it into a valid path. - The baseline where path generation uses a standard sequence-to-sequence model augmented with attention mechanism and path verification uses depth-first search.:\n",

The prevalence of loneliness in older adults is estimated to be 40%. This secondary analysis examined differences between elders reporting and elders not reporting loneliness and the effect of gender on resourcefulness and measures of physical and mental health within the context of L. C. Hawkley and J. T. Cacioppo's (2010) theoretical model of loneliness. A descriptive, comparative design was used to examine gender differences and associations among loneliness and indicators of physical and mental health. Results indicated that for overall health, and indicators of physical health (functional status and number chronic conditions), no significant differences were found between those who reported loneliness and those who reported no loneliness. There were significant differences, however, between lonely elders and nonlonely elders on indicators of mental health, including both anxiety and depressive symptoms. Differences between lonely elders and nonlonely elders on measures of resourcefulness approached significance. The findings from this study suggest that intervention programs designed to prevent or reduce loneliness in older adults may be beneficial for preserving their mental health. - Policy makers conceptualize loneliness as a significant public health issue, particularly among older adults, due to its association with intense feelings of emptiness and abandonment, which can lead to depression and suicide. They recognize that loneliness affects a substantial portion of the elderly population, with an estimated prevalence of 40%. The findings from studies, such as the one examining differences in physical and mental health among lonely and nonlonely elders, highlight the importance of addressing mental health indicators like anxiety and depressive symptoms. Consequently, policy makers may focus on developing intervention programs aimed at preventing or reducing loneliness to preserve the mental health of older adults.:\n",

We do not use a softmax as we have found it is unnecessary for good performance, instead we simply use independent logistic classifiers. During training we use binary cross-entropy loss for the class predictions. - The authors use binary cross-entropy loss.:\n",

In both surveys subjects were asked to draw on a map (displayed under a Mercator projection) a polygon representing a given geographical descriptor, in the context of the geography of Galicia in Northwestern Spain (see Fig. FIGREF1 ). However, the surveys were run with different purposes, and the subject groups that participated in each survey and the list of descriptors provided were accordingly different.\\nThe first survey was run in order to obtain a high number of responses to be used as an evaluation testbed for modeling algorithms. It was answered by 15/16 year old students in a high school in Pontevedra (located in Western Galicia). 99 students provided answers for a list of 7 descriptors (including cardinal points, coast, inland, and a proper name). Figure FIGREF2 shows a representation of the answers given by the students for “Northern Galicia” and a contour map that illustrates the percentages of overlapping answers.\\nThe second survey was addressed to meteorologists in the Galician Weather Agency BIBREF12 . Its purpose was to gather data to create fuzzy models that will be used in a future NLG system in the weather domain.

The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database is an\\nelectronic healthcare database containing medical information on over 11\\nmillion patients that has excellent potential for detecting ADRs. In this paper\\nwe apply four existing electronic healthcare database signal detecting\\nalgorithms (MUTARA, HUNT, Temporal Pattern Discovery and modified ROR) on the\\nTHIN database for a selection of drugs from six chosen drug families. This is\\nthe first comparison of ADR signalling algorithms that includes MUTARA and HUNT\\nand enabled us to set a benchmark for the adverse drug reaction signalling\\nability of the THIN database. The drugs were selectively chosen to enable a\\ncomparison with previous work and for variety. It was found that no algorithm\\nwas generally superior and the algorithms' natural thresholds act at variable\\nstringencies. Furthermore, none of the algorithms perform well at detecting\\nrare ADRs.Comment: Soft Computing, 17(12) pp. 2381-2397, 201 - The provided context does not directly address organizational change in healthcare. It focuses on the potential of electronic healthcare databases, specifically the THIN database, for detecting adverse drug reactions (ADRs) using various signal detection algorithms. The study compares the effectiveness of these algorithms and finds variability in their performance, particularly in detecting rare ADRs. For information on organizational change in healthcare, additional sources would be needed.:\n",

Whilst positive associations have been found with learning, challenging questions are also raised about the educational values underlying ideas of ??effective?? leadership and the increased controls and enduring power and cultural disparities that accompany forms of distributed leadership. As an alternative, restructuring anchored in ideals of democratic leadership is compared and contrasted with distributed leadership. The paper concludes with brief observations on the role of co-operativism in providing a form of democratic anchoring. - 'Organizational change in healthcare often involves restructuring leadership into more distributed patterns, which has been associated with positive outcomes in learning.

It contains three domains: movie, taxi, and restaurant. The total count of dialogues per domain and train/valid/test split is reported in Table TABREF11. At every turn both user and agent acts are annotated, we use only the agent side as targets in our experiment. The acts are ordered in the dataset (each output sentence aligns with one act). The size of the sets of acts, slots, and act-slot pairs are also listed in Table TABREF11. Table TABREF12 shows the count of turns with multiple act annotations, which amounts to 23% of the dataset. We use MSR's dialogue management code and knowledge base to obtain the state at each turn and use it as input to every model. - Microsoft Research dataset containing movie, taxi and restaurant domains.:\n",

The visualization of the local attention model is much sharper than that of the global one. This contrast matches our expectation that local attention is designed to only focus on a subset of words each time. - Local attention method had sharper alignment weights than global one, that's due to it's designed to only focus on a subset of words each time.:\n",

Social neuroscience research often involves the use of simple and static stimuli lacking many of the potentially important aspects of real world activities and social interactions. Whilst this research has merit, there is a growing interest in the presentation of dynamic stimuli in a manner that allows researchers to assess the integrative processes carried out by perceivers over time. Herein, we discuss the potential of virtual reality for enhancing ecological validity while maintaining experimental control in social neuroscience research. Virtual reality is a technology that allows for the creation of fully interactive, three-dimensional computerized models of social situations that can be fully controlled by the experimenter. Furthermore, the introduction of interactive virtual characters-either driven by a human or by a computer-allows the researcher to test, in a systematic and independent manner, the effects of various social cues. We first introduce key technical features and concepts related to virtual reality. Next, we discuss the potential of this technology for enhancing social neuroscience protocols, drawing on illustrative experiments from the literature. - Yes, virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. By using fully interactive, three-dimensional computerized models of social situations, VRET allows individuals to confront and gradually become desensitized to anxiety-provoking social cues in a controlled and safe environment. This method enhances ecological validity while maintaining experimental control, making it a valuable tool in social neuroscience research and therapeutic applications. Studies have demonstrated that VRET can lead to significant reductions in social anxiety symptoms, providing a promising alternative or complement to traditional exposure therapy.:\n",

Most existing tools focus on Web-based interfaces, usability, and visual languages for creating mashups. A major challenge that has received limited attention is context-awareness and adaptivity of service mashups. In this paper we focus on two main aspects: First, a service capability model describing service characteristics that can be tracked and matched against the requirements associated with service mashups and second an algorithm to recommend refinements such as replacing services within mashups. We implemented a set of adaptation algorithms to validate our approach in real service-oriented systems. - he context provided does not directly address usability challenges related to access control and identity management systems. However, in general, usability challenges in these systems often include complex authentication processes, difficulty in managing multiple credentials, and lack of intuitive interfaces. These challenges can lead to user frustration, increased likelihood of security breaches due to poor password practices, and reduced overall system adoption. Improving usability in access control and identity management can enhance user experience and encourage better security practices.:\n",

We consider the following deep neural network architectures:•MNIST: A two-layer fully connected network, and a two-layer LeNet convoluational neural network architecture [9]. Both networks are trained with SGD with momentum using the MatConvNet [20] package.•CIFAR-10: We trained a three-layer LeNet architecture, as well as a Network In Network (NIN) architecture [11].•ILSVRC 2012: We used CaffeNet [7] and GoogLeNet [17] pre-trained models.\\nIn this work, we proposed an algorithm, DeepFool, to compute adversarial examples that fool state-of-the-art classifiers. It is based on an iterative linearization of the classifier to generate minimal perturbations that are sufficient to change classification labels. We provided extensive experimental evidence on three datasets and eight classifiers, showing the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods to compute adversarial perturbations, as well as the efficiency of the proposed approach. Due to its accurate estimation of the adversarial perturbations, the proposed DeepFool algorithm provides an efficient and accurate way to evaluate the robustness of classifiers and to enhance their performance by proper fine-tuning.The proposed approach can therefore be used as a reliable tool to accurately estimate the minimal perturbation vectors, and build more robust classifiers. - Although the conclusion of the paper claims that 8 different classifiers were used, we can only see 6 classifiers with different datasets\\: 2-layer fully-connected network (MNIST), 2-layer LeNet (MNIST), 3-layer LeNet (CIFAR-10), NIN (CIFAR-10), CaffeNet (ILSVRC 2012), and GoogLeNet (ILSVRC 2012).:\n",

Give an answer in NSP loss and their performance perspective.\\n\\nContext:\\n\\n\\nThe NSP loss was hypothesized to be an important factor in training the original BERT model. Devlin et al. (2019) observe that removing NSP hurts performance, with significant performance degradation on QNLI, MNLI, and SQuAD 1.1.However, some recent work has questioned the necessity of the NSP loss: Lample and Conneau (2019); Yang et al. (2019); Joshi et 0al. (2019).\\nWe next compare training without the NSP loss and training with blocks of text from a single document (doc-sentences).We find that this setting outperforms the originally published BERT_base results and that removing the NSP loss matches or slightly improves downstream task performance, in contrast to Devlin et al. (2019).It is possible that the original BERT implementation may only have removed the loss term while still retaining the segment-pair input format. - In BERT paper, author said that removing NSP can hurt the performance of the model. However, in RoBERTa paper, author said that removing NSP improves downstream task performance. Therefore, point of views in terms of NSP is different between BERT and RoBERTa.:\n",

Give a ratio.\\n\\nContext:\\n\\n\\nA random sample of the tokens in the input sequence is selected and replaced with the special token [MASK]. The MLM objective is a cross-entropy loss on predicting the masked tokens. BERT uniformly selects 15% of the input tokens for possible replacement. Of the selected tokens, 80% are replaced with [MASK], 10% are left unchanged, and 10% are replaced by a randomly selected vocabulary token. - 80% of tokens are replaced with [MASK] during training.:\n",

Using contrastive test sets for targeted evaluation of several contextual phenomena, we compare the performance of the models trained on round-trip translations and genuine document-level parallel data. Among the four phenomena in the test sets we use (deixis, lexical cohesion, VP ellipsis and ellipsis which affects NP inflection) we find VP ellipsis to be the hardest phenomenon to be captured using round-trip translations. - Four discourse phenomena - deixis, lexical cohesion, VP ellipsis, and ellipsis which affects NP inflection.:\n",

We review the literature on the effectiveness of tobacco countermarketing campaigns, characterise current state and national campaign approaches, present findings from qualitative approaches and laboratory experiments that explore a variety of messages (for example, health consequences, industry manipulation), and discuss newer, non-traditional approaches to countermarketing. In conclusion, we outline research needed to fill gaps in our existing knowledge and discuss future directions in tobacco countermarketing aimed at youth. The landscape in tobacco control has changeddramatically in the past two decades. Aninflux of significant funds for tobacco control began in the mid 1980s with dedicated state excise taxes, federal support for tobacco control. - Effective educational programs against smokeless tobacco often include comprehensive countermarketing campaigns that focus on the health consequences of tobacco use and industry manipulation tactics. These programs can be enhanced by using qualitative approaches and laboratory experiments to tailor messages that resonate with youth. Additionally, incorporating newer, non-traditional approaches, such as social media campaigns and interactive digital content, can also be effective. Future research is needed to identify and fill gaps in our understanding of the most impactful strategies.:\n",

Analyses were based on metabolite profile from 965 participants of the S4 and 890 weight-stable subjects of its seven-year follow-up study (KORA F4). 190 different serum metabolites were quantified in a targeted approach including amino acids, acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines (PCs), sphingomyelins and hexose. Associations between metabolite concentrations and the fat free mass index (FFMI) were analysed using adjusted linear regression models. To draw conclusions on enzymatic reactions, intra-metabolite class ratios were explored. Pairwise relationships among metabolites were investigated and illustrated by means of Gaussian graphical models (GGMs). We found 339 significant associations between FFMI and various metabolites in KORA S4. Among the most prominent associations (p-values 4.75 × 10(-16)-8.95 × 10(-06)) with higher FFMI were increasing concentrations of the branched chained amino acids (BCAAs), ratios of BCAAs to glucogenic amino acids, and carnitine concentrations. For various PCs, a decrease in chain length or in saturation of the fatty acid moieties could be observed with increasing FFMI, as well as an overall shift from acyl-alkyl PCs to diacyl PCs. These findings were reproduced in KORA F4. The established GGMs supported the regression results and provided a comprehensive picture of the relationships between metabolites. In a sub-analysis, most of the discovered associations did not exist in obese subjects in contrast to non-obese subjects, possibly indicating derangements in skeletal muscle metabolism. A set of serum metabolites strongly associated with FFMI was identified and a network explaining the relationships among metabolites was established. These results offer a novel and more complete picture of the FFMI effects on serum metabolites in a data-driven network. - The provided context does not directly address the relationship between saturated fat intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cancer. Instead, it focuses on the influence of fat-free mass on serum metabolite profiles in participants of the KORA S4 and F4 studies. To answer the question about saturated fat intake and its impact on CVD and cancer risk, additional information from relevant nutritional and epidemiological studies would be required.:\n",

Contemporary data, however, has highlighted the added value of imaging modalities over the exercise electrocardiogram in the investigation of coronary artery disease. Given the physiological changes associated with exercise and the possibility to address other parameters such as rhythm changes and the chronotropic response, exercise stress testing with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring can still have an important place in contemporary clinical practice. We report the case of a complete atrioventricular block associated with exercise and discuss the current role of exercise stress testing with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in this entity. - Yes, it is possible to implement international electrocardiogram interpretation criteria in an algorithm to analyze endurance athletes' electrocardiograms. Algorithms can be designed to incorporate standardized criteria, allowing for consistent and accurate interpretation of ECGs in this specific population. This approach can help in identifying abnormal patterns that may be indicative of underlying cardiovascular issues, while also accounting for the physiological changes associated with high levels of physical activity.:\n",

A selection of archives of businesses founded and run by Quakers, as well as of family and personal papers of Friends in business are surveyed here. Both the historical context and a summary of the surviving sources are given for each collection surveyed, with details of where the material is held. Examples have been chosen to represent the Quaker contribution to particular trades and industries, and in some cases, to promote collections which have recently been catalogued or are little known. - Quaker meetings use silence as a central component of their decision-making process. During meetings, participants sit in silent contemplation, allowing space for reflection and the emergence of a sense of collective guidance. Decisions are made when a sense of unity or consensus is felt among the group, often articulated by individuals who feel moved to speak. This practice emphasizes discernment and the belief that truth can emerge from the shared silence.:\n",

What would a model trained on this task do if the context \"c\" itself had factually incorrect information?\\n\\nContext:\\n\\n\\nIn this work we seek to directly address the lack of real natural language training data by introducing a novel approach to building a supervised reading comprehension data set. We observe that summary and paraphrase sentences, with their associated documents, can be readily converted to context–query–answer triples using simple entity detection and anonymization algorithms.Using this approach we have collected two new corpora of roughly a million news stories with associated queries from the CNN and Daily Mail websites.\\nThe reading comprehension task naturally lends itself to a formulation as a supervised learning problem. Specifically we seek to estimate the conditional probability p(a|c,q), where c is a context document, q a query relating to that document, and a the answer to that query.For a focused evaluation we wish to be able to exclude additional information,such as world knowledge gained from co-occurrence statistics, in order to test a model’s core capability to detect and understand the linguistic relationships between entities in the context document.\\nNote that the focus of this paper is to provide a corpus for evaluating a model’s ability to read and comprehend a single document, not world knowledge or co-occurrence. To understand that distinction consider for instance the following close form queries (created from headlines in the Daily Mail validation set):\\na) The hi-tech bra that helps you beat breast X;\\nb) Could Saccharin help beat X ?;\\nc) Can fish oils help fight prostate X ?\\nAn ngram language model trained on the Daily Mail would easily correctly predict that (X = cancer), regardless of the contents of the context document, simply because this is a very frequently cured entity in the Daily Mail corpus. - The authors are training a reading comprehension model. Therefore, if the context “c” has incorrect information, the model is likely to answer based on the factually incorrect information itself. The authors clearly explain that the task their model is being built for and evaluated on is of identifying answers from a given text (i.e. comprehension) and not knowledge of global correctness.:\n",

Why is this a necessary step in the process?\\n\\nContext:\\n\\n\\nTo prevent such degenerate solutions and create a focused task we anonymize and randomize our corpora with the following procedure,a) use a co-reference system to establish co-referents in each data point; b) replace all entities with abstract entity markers according to co-reference; c) randomly permute these entity markers whenever a data point is loaded.\\nCompare the original and anonymized version of the example in Table 3. Clearly a human reader can answer both queries correctly.However in the anonymized setup the context document is required for answering the query, whereas the original version could also be answered by someone with the requisite background knowledge.Therefore, following this procedure, the only remaining strategy for answering questions is to do so by exploiting the context presented with each question.Thus performance on our two corpora truly measures reading comprehension capability. Naturally a production system would benefit from using all available information sources, such as clues through language and co-occurrence statistics. - Since the authors are attempting to build a reading comprehension model, not anonymizing the entities before using the dataset might lead to a situation where models use external information, or statistics on the distribution/frequency of words themselves to guess answers. These steps are needed to ensure that models use the context to answer the questions.:\n",
      "8     Question:\\n\\nDo the authors claim that bigger datasets would improve the performance and expressiveness of reading comprehension models?\\n\\nContext:\\n\\n\\nWhile obtaining supervised natural language reading comprehension data has proved difficult, some researchers have explored generating synthetic narratives and queries [3, 4]. Such approaches allow the generation of almost unlimited amounts of supervised data and enable researchers to isolate the performance of their algorithms on individual simulated phenomena. Work on such data has shown that neural network based models hold promise for modelling reading comprehension, something that we will build upon here. Historically, however, many similar approaches in Computational Linguistics have failed to manage the transition from synthetic data to real environments, as such closed worlds inevitably fail to capture the complexity, richness, and noise of natural language[5].\\nThe supervised paradigm for training machine reading and comprehension models provides a promising avenue for making progress on the path to building full natural language understanding systems. We have demonstrated a methodology for obtaining a large number of document-query-answer triples and shown that recurrent and attention based neural networks provide an effective modelling framework for this task.Our analysis indicates that the Attentive and Impatient Readers are able to propagate and integrate semantic information over long distances. In particular we believe that the incorporation of an attention mechanism is the key contributor to these results.\\nHere we propose a methodology for creating real-world, large scale supervised training data for learning reading comprehension models. Inspired by work in summarization [10, 11], we create two machine reading corpora by exploiting online newspaper articles and their matching summaries. We have collected 93k articles from the CNN ww.cnn.com and 220k articles from the Daily Mail ww.dailymail.co.uk websites. Both news providers supplement their articles with a number of bullet points, summarizing aspects of the information contained in the article. Of key importance is that these summary points are abstractive and do not simply copy sentences from the documents.We construct a corpus of document–query–answer triples by turning these bullet points into Cloze [12] style questions by replacing one entity at a time with a placeholder. This results in a combined corpus of roughly 1M data points (Table 1).Code to replicate our datasets—and to apply this method to other sources—is available online http://www.github.com/deepmind/rc-data/.\\nNote that the focus of this paper is to provide a corpus for evaluating a model’s ability to read and comprehend a single document, not world knowledge or co-occurrence. To understand that distinction consider for instance the following Cloze form queries (created from headlines in the Daily Mail validation set):a) The hi-tech bra that helps you beat breast X;b) Could Saccharin help beat X ?;c) Can fish oils help fight prostate X ?An ngram language model trained on the Daily Mail would easily correctly predictthat (X = cancer), regardless of the contents of the context document, simply because this is a very frequently cured entity in the Daily Mail corpus. - Based on the information in this paper alone, it is unclear if a bigger dataset would improve the performance of reading comprehension models. While authors explain that a key contribution they make is the creation of a real-world, massive labelled reading comprehension dataset, it is unclear if such a dataset is essential to improve the performance of reading comprehension models - the authors pitch their dataset-building approach also as a way of evaluating performance of these models, which is different from the dataset itself leading to better performance.:\n",

It has been shown Banerjee et al. (2005) for Bregman divergences that the cluster representative achieving minimal distance to its assigned points is the cluster mean. Thus the prototype computation in Equation (1) yields optimal cluster representatives given the support set labels when a Bregman divergence is used. - Yes, prototype computation can be viewed in terms of hard clustering on the support set, with one cluster per class and each support point assigned to its corresponding class cluster.:\n",

This introduces a significant imbalance between the positive and negative training examples. Instead of using all the negative examples, we sort them using the highest confidence loss for each default box and pick the top ones so that the ratio between the negatives and positives is at most 3:1. We found that this leads to faster optimization and a more stable training. - When the number of available default boxes is high, the majority of the default boxes after the matching phase are negatives. As a result, there is now a sizable imbalance between the training instances that are good and negative.

As popularized in the R-CNN framework [11], the first stage generates a sparse set of candidate object locations and the second stage classifies each candidate location as one of the foreground classes or as background using a convolutional neural network. Through a sequence of advances [10, 28, 20, 14], this two-stage framework consistently achieves top accuracy on the challenging COCO benchmark [21]. - In the two-stage mechanism for object detection, the first stage generates a sparse set of candidate object locations and the second stage classifies each candidate location as one of the foreground or background classes using a CNN. If the CNN outputs more foreground or background classes than the latter, we can say that foreground-background imbalance has occurred.:\n",

It was answered by 15/16 year old students in a high school in Pontevedra (located in Western Galicia). 99 students provided answers for a list of 7 descriptors (including cardinal points, coast, inland, and a proper name). Figure FIGREF2 shows a representation of the answers given by the students for “Northern Galicia” and a contour map that illustrates the percentages of overlapping answers.\\nThe second survey was addressed to meteorologists in the Galician Weather Agency BIBREF12 . Its purpose was to gather data to create fuzzy models that will be used in a future NLG system in the weather domain. Eight meteorologists completed the survey, which included a list of 24 descriptors. For instance, Figure FIGREF3 shows a representation of the answers given by the meteorologists for “Eastern Galicia” and a contour map that illustrates the percentage of overlapping answers. - Two surveys by two groups - school students and meteorologists to draw on a map a polygon representing a given geographical descriptor.:</td>\n",

Most existing tools focus on Web-based interfaces, usability, and visual languages for creating mashups. A major challenge that has received limited attention is context-awareness and adaptivity of service mashups. In this paper we focus on two main aspects: First, a service capability model describing service characteristics that can be tracked and matched against the requirements associated with service mashups and second an algorithm to recommend refinements such as replacing services within mashups. We implemented a set of adaptation algorithms to validate our approach in real service-oriented systems. - he context provided does not directly address usability challenges related to access control and identity management systems. However, in general, usability challenges in these systems often include complex authentication processes, difficulty in managing multiple credentials, and lack of intuitive interfaces. These challenges can lead to user frustration, increased likelihood of security breaches due to poor password practices, and reduced overall system adoption. Improving usability in access control and identity management can enhance user experience and encourage better security practices.:</td>\n",

It is based on an iterative linearization of the classifier to generate minimal perturbations that are sufficient to change classification labels. We provided extensive experimental evidence on three datasets and eight classifiers, showing the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods to compute adversarial perturbations, as well as the efficiency of the proposed approach. Due to its accurate estimation of the adversarial perturbations, the proposed DeepFool algorithm provides an efficient and accurate way to evaluate the robustness of classifiers and to enhance their performance by proper fine-tuning.The proposed approach can therefore be used as a reliable tool to accurately estimate the minimal perturbation vectors, and build more robust classifiers. - Although the conclusion of the paper claims that 8 different classifiers were used, we can only see 6 classifiers with different datasets\\: 2-layer fully-connected network (MNIST), 2-layer LeNet (MNIST), 3-layer LeNet (CIFAR-10), NIN (CIFAR-10), CaffeNet (ILSVRC 2012), and GoogLeNet (ILSVRC 2012).:</td>\n",

       "      <td>To characterise the influence of the fat free mass on the metabolite profile in serum samples from participants of the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) S4 study. Analyses were based on metabolite profile from 965 participants of the S4 and 890 weight-stable subjects of its seven-year follow-up study (KORA F4). 190 different serum metabolites were quantified in a targeted approach including amino acids, acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines (PCs), sphingomyelins and hexose. Associations between metabolite concentrations and the fat free mass index (FFMI) were analysed using adjusted linear regression models. To draw conclusions on enzymatic reactions, intra-metabolite class ratios were explored. Pairwise relationships among metabolites were investigated and illustrated by means of Gaussian graphical models (GGMs). We found 339 significant associations between FFMI and various metabolites in KORA S4. Among the most prominent associations (p-values 4.75 × 10(-16)-8.95 × 10(-06)) with higher FFMI were increasing concentrations of the branched chained amino acids (BCAAs), ratios of BCAAs to glucogenic amino acids, and carnitine concentrations. For various PCs, a decrease in chain length or in saturation of the fatty acid moieties could be observed with increasing FFMI, as well as an overall shift from acyl-alkyl PCs to diacyl PCs. These findings were reproduced in KORA F4. The established GGMs supported the regression results and provided a comprehensive picture of the relationships between metabolites. In a sub-analysis, most of the discovered associations did not exist in obese subjects in contrast to non-obese subjects, possibly indicating derangements in skeletal muscle metabolism. A set of serum metabolites strongly associated with FFMI was identified and a network explaining the relationships among metabolites was established. These results offer a novel and more complete picture of the FFMI effects on serum metabolites in a data-driven network. - The provided context does not directly address the relationship between saturated fat intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cancer. Instead, it focuses on the influence of fat-free mass on serum metabolite profiles in participants of the KORA S4 and F4 studies. To answer the question about saturated fat intake and its impact on CVD and cancer risk, additional information from relevant nutritional and epidemiological studies would be required.:</td>\n",

In Quaker meetings, silence is often used as a means of facilitating decision-making and spiritual growth. Quakers believe in the importance of listening to the inner light, or the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and silence is seen as a way to clear the mind and heart of distractions, allowing for a deeper connection with this inner guidance.\\n\\nIn Quaker meetings, silence is often used in several ways:\\n\\n1. Silent worship: Quakers often begin their meetings with a period of silent worship, where individuals sit in silence, reflecting on their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This silence is seen as a way to center themselves and connect with the divine.\\n2. Silent discussion: During meetings, Quakers may use silence as a way to facilitate discussion and decision-making. When a question or issue arises, the meeting may enter into a period of silence, allowing individuals to reflect on the issue and seek guidance from the inner light. This silence can help to clarify thoughts and feelings, and can lead to a sense of consensus and unity among the meeting.\\n3. Silent waiting: Quakers may also use silence as a way to wait for guidance or direction. When faced with a difficult decision or uncertain situation, Quakers may enter into a period of silent waiting, seeking guidance from the inner light.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that Quaker decision-making processes are often characterized by a sense of consensus and unity, rather than majority vote. Quakers believe that decisions should be made in a spirit of love and respect for one another, and that the guidance of the inner light should be sought in all matters.</td>\n",

In the first stage, the detector generates a sparse set of candidate object locations, which are typically fewer in number compared to the background regions.

Since there are more background proposals, the classifier is more likely to encounter background samples, leading to an imbalance between foreground and background classes. This imbalance can affect the performance of the detector, as it may become biased towards predicting the majority class (background) and struggle to accurately detect the minority class (foreground).

By using fully interactive, three-dimensional computerized models of social situations, VRET allows individuals to confront and gradually become desensitized to anxiety-provoking social cues in a controlled and safe environment. This method enhances ecological validity while maintaining experimental control, making it a valuable tool in social neuroscience research and therapeutic applications. Studies have demonstrated that VRET can lead to significant reductions in social anxiety symptoms, providing a promising alternative or complement to traditional exposure therapy.   \n",

During meetings, participants sit in silent contemplation, allowing space for reflection and the emergence of a sense of collective guidance. Decisions are made when a sense of unity or consensus is felt among the group, often articulated by individuals who feel moved to speak. This practice emphasizes discernment and the belief that truth can emerge from the shared silence.   \n",

As a result, there is now a sizable imbalance between the training instances that are good and negative. The biggest confidence loss for each default box is used to order the negative instances, and the top ones are chosen so that the ratio of negative to positive examples is no greater than 3:1.

This can involve changes in policies, procedures, technology, leadership, and workforce. Organizational change in healthcare is often driven by factors such as advancements in medical technology, changes in healthcare regulations, shifts in patient demographics, and the need to address emerging health challenges.\\n\\nSeveral models and theories have been developed to guide and facilitate organizational change in healthcare, such as Lewin's Change Management Model, Kotter's 8-Step Change Model, and the McKinsey 7-S Framework. These models emphasize the importance of effective communication, stakeholder engagement, and continuous evaluation and adaptation during the change process.\\n\\nOrganizational change in healthcare can be challenging due to the complexity of healthcare systems, resistance to change from staff, and the need to balance financial constraints with the goal of improving patient care. However, successful organizational change can lead to improved healthcare delivery, better patient outcomes, and increased staff satisfaction.   \n",

However, it does discuss factors affecting the re-usage intentions of members in a cosmetic virtual community (VC), which could be related to video game players' interest in cosmetic virtual goods.\\n\\nThe study found that performance expectancy and social influence significantly affect re-usage intentions in a cosmetic VC. Performance expectancy refers to the belief that using a system or product will improve performance. In the context of video games, players may value cosmetic virtual goods because they enhance their gaming experience, allowing them to customize their characters or environments, which can lead to a more enjoyable and immersive gameplay experience.\\n\\nSocial influence refers to the impact of others' opinions and behaviors on an individual's decision-making process. In the context of video games, players may value cosmetic virtual goods because they can showcase their unique style or achievements to other players, which can lead to social recognition and a sense of belonging within the gaming community.\\n\\nWhile the context does not directly address video game players' valuation of cosmetic virtual goods, the findings suggest that performance expectancy and social influence play a significant role in the re-usage intentions of VC members, which could be applicable to video game players' interest in cosmetic virtual goods.   \n",

(2019) hypothesized that the Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) loss was an important factor in training the original BERT model. They observed that removing NSP hurts performance, with significant performance degradation on QNLI, MNLI, and SQuAD 1.1. However, some recent work has questioned the necessity of the NSP loss, such as Lample and Conneau (2019), Yang et al. (2019), and Joshi et al. (2019).\\n\\nOn the other hand, the RoBERTa paper by Liu et al. (2019) suggests that removing the NSP loss does not significantly impact the model's performance. They found that training without the NSP loss and training with blocks of text from a single document (doc-sentences) outperforms the originally published BERT base results. In contrast to Devlin et al. (2019), removing the NSP loss matches or slightly improves downstream task performance in RoBERTa.\\n\\nIn summary, the BERT paper emphasizes the importance of NSP loss for model performance, while the RoBERTa paper suggests that NSP loss may not be as crucial for achieving good performance.   \n",

The study focuses on the influence of fat-free mass on the metabolite profile in serum samples from participants of the KORA S4 study. However, it does mention that various phosphatidylcholines (PCs) showed a decrease in chain length or in saturation of the fatty acid moieties with increasing fat-free mass index (FFMI). While this information is related to fatty acids, it does not specifically address the impact of saturated fat intake on CVD and cancer risk.   \n",

Such an algorithm could be designed to incorporate the standardized criteria for ECG interpretation, which would help in identifying any abnormalities or potential cardiac issues in endurance athletes. This could be particularly useful in the context of exercise stress testing, where physiological changes associated with exercise can impact the ECG readings. By using an algorithm that adheres to international criteria, clinicians can ensure a consistent and accurate assessment of the athletes' cardiac health.   \n",

However, the accuracy of the model's predictions may be compromised due to the incorrect information in the context. The model's core capability to detect and understand the linguistic relationships between entities in the context document may still be tested, but the overall performance and reliability of the model could be negatively affected by the presence of factually incorrect information in the context.   \n",
       "7   A dataset without entity replacement or anonymization would have several weaknesses when training a reading comprehension model. Firstly, it would allow the model to rely on memorization of specific entities and their relationships, rather than truly understanding the context and content of the text. This could lead to poor generalization and performance on unseen data.\\n\\nSecondly, without anonymization, the model might overfit to specific entities and their occurrences, which could hinder its ability to generalize to new texts with different entities. This would limit the model's ability to perform well on real-world tasks, where it would encounter a wide variety of entities and contexts.\\n\\nThirdly, a non-anonymized dataset could introduce biases in the model's performance, as it might learn to associate certain entities with specific answers or outcomes. This could lead to unfair or inaccurate predictions when the model is applied to new data.\\n\\nAnonymization and entity replacement are necessary steps in the process to ensure that the model learns to focus on the context and content of the text, rather than specific entities. This helps the model develop a more robust understanding of the text and improves its ability to generalize to new data. Additionally, anonymization helps to mitigate biases and ensure that the model's performance is not influenced by specific entities or their occurrences. Overall, these steps contribute to a more effective and fair reading comprehension model.   \n",

This approach ensures that the ratio between negatives and positives does not exceed 3:1, leading to faster optimization and more stable training.   \n",

In the first stage, the detector generates a sparse set of candidate object locations, which are typically fewer in number compared to the background regions. This leads to a higher number of background proposals than foreground proposals. In the second stage, the detector classifies each candidate location as either foreground or background. Since there are more background proposals, the classifier is more likely to encounter background samples, leading to an imbalance between foreground and background classes. This imbalance can affect the performance of the detector, as it may become biased towards predicting the majority class (background) and struggle to accurately detect the minority class (foreground). To address this issue, various techniques such as hard negative mining, class-balanced loss functions, and data augmentation can be employed to improve the detector's ability to handle class imbalance.   \n",

The study explores factors affecting the re-usage intentions of VC members, which is related to online cosmetic-related communities.\\n\\nHowever, based on the findings of the study, it can be inferred that users in the cosmetic virtual community value performance expectancy, which means they are more likely to reuse the VC if it provides them with useful information, helps them accomplish tasks quickly and productively, and offers a wide range of cosmetic products.   \n",

The text suggests that exercise stress testing with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring can still have a role in clinical practice, particularly in cases where physiological changes and rhythm changes need to be assessed. This implies that electrocardiogram interpretation may require more nuanced consideration of the context and clinical presentation, rather than relying solely on international criteria.   \n",
       "20  The question appears to be unrelated to the provided context, which focuses on the history of Quaker involvement in industry and commerce, with a regional focus on Yorkshire. The context does not mention Quaker meetings or decision-making processes, so it is not possible to provide an answer based on the given context.\\n\\nHowever, I can provide some general information about Quaker decision-making processes. In Quaker meetings, silence is often used as a means of facilitating decision-making and spiritual growth. Quakers believe in the importance of listening to the inner light, or the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and silence is seen as a way to clear the mind and heart of distractions, allowing for a deeper connection with this inner guidance.\\n\\nIn Quaker meetings, silence is often used in several ways:\\n\\n1. Silent worship: Quakers often begin their meetings with a period of silent worship, where individuals sit in silence, reflecting on their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This silence is seen as a way to center themselves and connect with the divine.\\n2. Silent discussion: During meetings, Quakers may use silence as a way to facilitate discussion and decision-making. When a question or issue arises, the meeting may enter into a period of silence, allowing individuals to reflect on the issue and seek guidance from the inner light. This silence can help to clarify thoughts and feelings, and can lead to a sense of consensus and unity among the meeting.\\n3. Silent waiting: Quakers may also use silence as a way to wait for guidance or direction. When faced with a difficult decision or uncertain situation, Quakers may enter into a period of silent waiting, seeking guidance from the inner light.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that Quaker decision-making processes are often characterized by a sense of consensus and unity, rather than majority vote. Quakers believe that decisions should be made in a spirit of love and respect for one another, and that the guidance of the inner light should be sought in all matters.   \n",

This would not accurately measure the model's reading comprehension capabilities, as it would not be able to generalize to new, unseen entities and contexts. By anonymizing and randomizing the entities, the model is forced to focus on the meaning and relationships within the text, rather than relying on specific entities and context, which is a more accurate reflection of human reading comprehension abilities.   \n",

Since there are typically many more background pixels than foreground objects, this can lead to an imbalance in the number of positive and negative samples in the training data. This imbalance can cause the network to become biased towards classifying most samples as background, leading to poor performance on detecting small or rare objects.   \n",

       "7   A dataset without entity replacement or anonymization would have the weakness of allowing the model to rely on background knowledge or prior associations between entities, rather than truly understanding the context of the passage. This is because the model could potentially answer questions correctly by recognizing specific entities and recalling relevant information, rather than actually reading and comprehending the passage. This would not accurately measure the model's reading comprehension capability, as it would be relying on external knowledge rather than the context provided.\\n\\nAnonymizing the entities by replacing them with abstract markers forces the model to focus on the context and relationships within the passage, rather than relying on prior knowledge or associations. This is a necessary step in the process because it ensures that the model is truly measuring reading comprehension, rather than just recalling external information. By anonymizing the entities, the model is required to understand the relationships and context within the passage, which is a more accurate measure of reading comprehension capability.   \n",

Virtual reality allows individuals to confront and gradually overcome their fears in a controlled and safe environment, which can help reduce anxiety levels and improve social functioning. This is achieved by exposing the individual to various social situations that trigger their anxiety, allowing them to practice coping strategies and desensitize themselves to the triggers over time. Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of VRET in treating social anxiety disorder, with results showing significant reductions in anxiety levels and improvements in social functioning compared to traditional therapy methods.   \n",

This could potentially be applicable to video game players as well, as they might value cosmetic virtual goods that offer similar benefits, such as enhancing their in-game performance or providing useful information or tools.   \n",

Firstly, it could lead to the model learning to solve tasks based on specific entities or names rather than understanding the underlying concepts. This is known as a degenerate solution. Secondly, the model might not generalize well to new data since it is trained on specific instances of entities.\\n\\nEntity replacement or anonymization is a necessary step in the process because it helps to create a focused task by preventing the model from learning to solve tasks based on specific entities.

This imbalance can lead to the model being biased towards correctly classifying background instances, as it sees many more of them during training. This can negatively impact the performance of the model in correctly identifying and classifying foreground objects.   \n",

They find that training without the NSP loss, while using blocks of text from a single document (doc-sentences), actually outperforms the original BERT base results.  Furthermore, removing the NSP loss matches or slightly improves downstream task performance. \\n\\nEssentially, the key difference is that RoBERTa suggests NSP loss is not strictly necessary for good performance, and might even be detrimental, while BERT emphasizes its importance. \\n\\n   \n",

Since there are usually far more background regions than foreground objects, the proposals generated in this stage are likely to be heavily skewed towards background regions.\\n* **Stage 2 (Classification):**  The second stage then classifies each proposal.  This means the model is trained to predominantly classify background instances, potentially leading to a bias towards background predictions and making it harder to accurately detect foreground objects.\\n\\n\\nTherefore, **foreground-background class imbalance** is likely encountered in two-stage detectors because the proposal generation process often results in a disproportionate number of background proposals compared to foreground proposals.

It divides the task of interpreting commands for behavioral navigation into two steps: path generation, and path verification. For path generation, this baseline uses a standard sequence-to-sequence model augmented with an attention mechanism, similar to BIBREF23 , BIBREF6 . For path verification, the baseline uses depth-first search to find a route in the graph that matches the sequence of predicted behaviors. If no route matches perfectly, the baseline changes up to three behaviors in the predicted sequence to try to turn it into a valid path. - The baseline where path generation uses a standard sequence-to-sequence model augmented with attention mechanism and path verification uses depth-first search.:  \n",

In both surveys subjects were asked to draw on a map (displayed under a Mercator projection) a polygon representing a given geographical descriptor, in the context of the geography of Galicia in Northwestern Spain (see Fig. FIGREF1 ). However, the surveys were run with different purposes, and the subject groups that participated in each survey and the list of descriptors provided were accordingly different.\\nThe first survey was run in order to obtain a high number of responses to be used as an evaluation testbed for modeling algorithms. It was answered by 15/16 year old students in a high school in Pontevedra (located in Western Galicia). 99 students provided answers for a list of 7 descriptors (including cardinal points, coast, inland, and a proper name). Figure FIGREF2 shows a representation of the answers given by the students for “Northern Galicia” and a contour map that illustrates the percentages of overlapping answers.\\nThe second survey was addressed to meteorologists in the Galician Weather Agency BIBREF12 . Its purpose was to gather data to create fuzzy models that will be used in a future NLG system in the weather domain. Eight meteorologists completed the survey, which included a list of 24 descriptors. For instance, Figure FIGREF3 shows a representation of the answers given by the meteorologists for “Eastern Galicia” and a contour map that illustrates the percentage of overlapping answers. - Two surveys by two groups - school students and meteorologists to draw on a map a polygon representing a given geographical descriptor.:  \n",

The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database is an\\nelectronic healthcare database containing medical information on over 11\\nmillion patients that has excellent potential for detecting ADRs. In this paper\\nwe apply four existing electronic healthcare database signal detecting\\nalgorithms (MUTARA, HUNT, Temporal Pattern Discovery and modified ROR) on the\\nTHIN database for a selection of drugs from six chosen drug families. This is\\nthe first comparison of ADR signalling algorithms that includes MUTARA and HUNT\\nand enabled us to set a benchmark for the adverse drug reaction signalling\\nability of the THIN database. The drugs were selectively chosen to enable a\\ncomparison with previous work and for variety. It was found that no algorithm\\nwas generally superior and the algorithms' natural thresholds act at variable\\nstringencies. Furthermore, none of the algorithms perform well at detecting\\nrare ADRs.Comment: Soft Computing, 17(12) pp. 2381-2397, 201 - The provided context does not directly address organizational change in healthcare. It focuses on the potential of electronic healthcare databases, specifically the THIN database, for detecting adverse drug reactions (ADRs) using various signal detection algorithms.

Whilst positive associations have been found with learning, challenging questions are also raised about the educational values underlying ideas of ??effective?? leadership and the increased controls and enduring power and cultural disparities that accompany forms of distributed leadership. As an alternative, restructuring anchored in ideals of democratic leadership is compared and contrasted with distributed leadership. The paper concludes with brief observations on the role of co-operativism in providing a form of democratic anchoring. - 'Organizational change in healthcare often involves restructuring leadership into more distributed patterns, which has been associated with positive outcomes in learning.

Social neuroscience research often involves the use of simple and static stimuli lacking many of the potentially important aspects of real world activities and social interactions. Whilst this research has merit, there is a growing interest in the presentation of dynamic stimuli in a manner that allows researchers to assess the integrative processes carried out by perceivers over time. Herein, we discuss the potential of virtual reality for enhancing ecological validity while maintaining experimental control in social neuroscience research. Virtual reality is a technology that allows for the creation of fully interactive, three-dimensional computerized models of social situations that can be fully controlled by the experimenter. Furthermore, the introduction of interactive virtual characters-either driven by a human or by a computer-allows the researcher to test, in a systematic and independent manner, the effects of various social cues. We first introduce key technical features and concepts related to virtual reality. Next, we discuss the potential of this technology for enhancing social neuroscience protocols, drawing on illustrative experiments from the literature. - Yes, virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. By using fully interactive, three-dimensional computerized models of social situations, VRET allows individuals to confront and gradually become desensitized to anxiety-provoking social cues in a controlled and safe environment. This method enhances ecological validity while maintaining experimental control, making it a valuable tool in social neuroscience research and therapeutic applications. Studies have demonstrated that VRET can lead to significant reductions in social anxiety symptoms, providing a promising alternative or complement to traditional exposure therapy.:  \n",

Most existing tools focus on Web-based interfaces, usability, and visual languages for creating mashups. A major challenge that has received limited attention is context-awareness and adaptivity of service mashups. In this paper we focus on two main aspects: First, a service capability model describing service characteristics that can be tracked and matched against the requirements associated with service mashups and second an algorithm to recommend refinements such as replacing services within mashups. We implemented a set of adaptation algorithms to validate our approach in real service-oriented systems. - he context provided does not directly address usability challenges related to access control and identity management systems. However, in general, usability challenges in these systems often include complex authentication processes, difficulty in managing multiple credentials, and lack of intuitive interfaces. These challenges can lead to user frustration, increased likelihood of security breaches due to poor password practices, and reduced overall system adoption. Improving usability in access control and identity management can enhance user experience and encourage better security practices.:  \n",

We consider the following deep neural network architectures:•MNIST: A two-layer fully connected network, and a two-layer LeNet convoluational neural network architecture [9]. Both networks are trained with SGD with momentum using the MatConvNet [20] package.•CIFAR-10: We trained a three-layer LeNet architecture, as well as a Network In Network (NIN) architecture [11].•ILSVRC 2012: We used CaffeNet [7] and GoogLeNet [17] pre-trained models.\\nIn this work, we proposed an algorithm, DeepFool, to compute adversarial examples that fool state-of-the-art classifiers. It is based on an iterative linearization of the classifier to generate minimal perturbations that are sufficient to change classification labels. We provided extensive experimental evidence on three datasets and eight classifiers, showing the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods to compute adversarial perturbations, as well as the efficiency of the proposed approach. Due to its accurate estimation of the adversarial perturbations, the proposed DeepFool algorithm provides an efficient and accurate way to evaluate the robustness of classifiers and to enhance their performance by proper fine-tuning.The proposed approach can therefore be used as a reliable tool to accurately estimate the minimal perturbation vectors, and build more robust classifiers. - Although the conclusion of the paper claims that 8 different classifiers were used, we can only see 6 classifiers with different datasets\\: 2-layer fully-connected network (MNIST), 2-layer LeNet (MNIST), 3-layer LeNet (CIFAR-10), NIN (CIFAR-10), CaffeNet (ILSVRC 2012), and GoogLeNet (ILSVRC 2012).:  \n",

We review the literature on the effectiveness of tobacco countermarketing campaigns, characterise current state and national campaign approaches, present findings from qualitative approaches and laboratory experiments that explore a variety of messages (for example, health consequences, industry manipulation), and discuss newer, non-traditional approaches to countermarketing. In conclusion, we outline research needed to fill gaps in our existing knowledge and discuss future directions in tobacco countermarketing aimed at youth. The landscape in tobacco control has changeddramatically in the past two decades. Aninflux of significant funds for tobacco control began in the mid 1980s with dedicated state excise taxes, federal support for tobacco control. - Effective educational programs against smokeless tobacco often include comprehensive countermarketing campaigns that focus on the health consequences of tobacco use and industry manipulation tactics. These programs can be enhanced by using qualitative approaches and laboratory experiments to tailor messages that resonate with youth. Additionally, incorporating newer, non-traditional approaches, such as social media campaigns and interactive digital content, can also be effective. Future research is needed to identify and fill gaps in our understanding of the most impactful strategies.:  \n",
       "16  To characterise the influence of the fat free mass on the metabolite profile in serum samples from participants of the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) S4 study. Analyses were based on metabolite profile from 965 participants of the S4 and 890 weight-stable subjects of its seven-year follow-up study (KORA F4). 190 different serum metabolites were quantified in a targeted approach including amino acids, acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines (PCs), sphingomyelins and hexose. Associations between metabolite concentrations and the fat free mass index (FFMI) were analysed using adjusted linear regression models. To draw conclusions on enzymatic reactions, intra-metabolite class ratios were explored. Pairwise relationships among metabolites were investigated and illustrated by means of Gaussian graphical models (GGMs). We found 339 significant associations between FFMI and various metabolites in KORA S4. Among the most prominent associations (p-values 4.75 × 10(-16)-8.95 × 10(-06)) with higher FFMI were increasing concentrations of the branched chained amino acids (BCAAs), ratios of BCAAs to glucogenic amino acids, and carnitine concentrations. For various PCs, a decrease in chain length or in saturation of the fatty acid moieties could be observed with increasing FFMI, as well as an overall shift from acyl-alkyl PCs to diacyl PCs. These findings were reproduced in KORA F4. The established GGMs supported the regression results and provided a comprehensive picture of the relationships between metabolites. In a sub-analysis, most of the discovered associations did not exist in obese subjects in contrast to non-obese subjects, possibly indicating derangements in skeletal muscle metabolism. A set of serum metabolites strongly associated with FFMI was identified and a network explaining the relationships among metabolites was established. These results offer a novel and more complete picture of the FFMI effects on serum metabolites in a data-driven network. - The provided context does not directly address the relationship between saturated fat intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cancer. Instead, it focuses on the influence of fat-free mass on serum metabolite profiles in participants of the KORA S4 and F4 studies. To answer the question about saturated fat intake and its impact on CVD and cancer risk, additional information from relevant nutritional and epidemiological studies would be required.:  \n",

Contemporary data, however, has highlighted the added value of imaging modalities over the exercise electrocardiogram in the investigation of coronary artery disease. Given the physiological changes associated with exercise and the possibility to address other parameters such as rhythm changes and the chronotropic response, exercise stress testing with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring can still have an important place in contemporary clinical practice. We report the case of a complete atrioventricular block associated with exercise and discuss the current role of exercise stress testing with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in this entity. - Yes, it is possible to implement international electrocardiogram interpretation criteria in an algorithm to analyze endurance athletes' electrocardiograms. Algorithms can be designed to incorporate standardized criteria, allowing for consistent and accurate interpretation of ECGs in this specific population. This approach can help in identifying abnormal patterns that may be indicative of underlying cardiovascular issues, while also accounting for the physiological changes associated with high levels of physical activity.:  \n",

A selection of archives of businesses founded and run by Quakers, as well as of family and personal papers of Friends in business are surveyed here. Both the historical context and a summary of the surviving sources are given for each collection surveyed, with details of where the material is held. Examples have been chosen to represent the Quaker contribution to particular trades and industries, and in some cases, to promote collections which have recently been catalogued or are little known. - Quaker meetings use silence as a central component of their decision-making process. During meetings, participants sit in silent contemplation, allowing space for reflection and the emergence of a sense of collective guidance. Decisions are made when a sense of unity or consensus is felt among the group, often articulated by individuals who feel moved to speak. This practice emphasizes discernment and the belief that truth can emerge from the shared silence.:  \n",

Such approaches allow the generation of almost unlimited amounts of supervised data and enable researchers to isolate the performance of their algorithms on individual simulated phenomena. Work on such data has shown that neural network based models hold promise for modelling reading comprehension, something that we will build upon here. Historically, however, many similar approaches in Computational Linguistics have failed to manage the transition from synthetic data to real environments, as such closed worlds inevitably fail to capture the complexity, richness, and noise of natural language[5].  \n",

Thus the prototype computation in Equation (1) yields optimal cluster representatives given the support set labels when a Bregman divergence is used. - Yes, prototype computation can be viewed in terms of hard clustering on the support set, with one cluster per class and each support point assigned to its corresponding class cluster.:  \n",

This introduces a significant imbalance between the positive and negative training examples. Instead of using all the negative examples, we sort them using the highest confidence loss for each default box and pick the top ones so that the ratio between the negatives and positives is at most 3:1. We found that this leads to faster optimization and a more stable training. - When the number of available default boxes is high, the majority of the default boxes after the matching phase are negatives. As a result, there is now a sizable imbalance between the training instances that are good and negative. The biggest confidence loss for each default box is used to order the negative instances, and the top ones are chosen so that the ratio of negative to positive examples is no greater than 3\\:1. This process is called as Hard Negative Mining.:  \n",
