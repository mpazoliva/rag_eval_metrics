However, the complex circuits and high operating voltages of conventional artificial vision systems present great challenges for device integration and power consumption. Here, we report bioinspired synaptic transistors based on organic single crystal phototransistors, which exhibit excitation and inhibition synaptic plasticity with time-varying. By manipulating the charge dynamics of the trapping centers of organic crystal-electret vertical stacks, organic transistors can operate below 1\u00a0V with record high on/off ratios close to 10",
    "1": "Glaucoma, an irreversible optic neuropathy, primarily affects retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and causes vision loss and blindness. The damage to RGCs in glaucoma occurs by various mechanisms, including elevated intraocular pressure, oxidative stress, inflammation, and other neurodegenerative processes. As the disease progresses, the loss of RGCs leads to vision loss. Therefore, protecting RGCs from damage and promoting their survival are important goals in managing glaucoma. In this regard, resveratrol (RES), a polyphenolic phytoalexin, exerts antioxidant effects and slows down the evolution and progression of glaucoma. The present review shows that RES plays a protective role in RGCs in cases of ischemic injury and hypoxia as well as in ErbB2 protein expression in the retina. Additionally, RES plays protective roles in RGCs by promoting cell growth, reducing apoptosis, and decreasing oxidative stress in H",
    "2": "Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) has caused severe intestinal diseases in pigs. It originates from bat coronaviruses HKU2 and has a potential risk of cross-species transmission, raising concerns about its zoonotic potential. Viral entry-related host factors are critical determinants of susceptibility to cells, tissues, or species, and remain to be elucidated for SADS-CoV. Type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) family is involved in many coronavirus infections and has trypsin-like catalytic activity. Here we examine all 18 members of the TTSPs family through CRISPR-based activation of endogenous protein expression in cells, and find that, in addition to TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, TMPRSS13 significantly facilitates SADS-CoV infection. This is confirmed by ectopic expression of TMPRSS13, and specific to trypsin-dependent SADS-CoV. Infection with pseudovirus bearing SADS-CoV spike protein indicates that TMPRSS13 acts at the entry step and is sensitive to serine protease inhibitor Camostat. Moreover, both human and pig TMPRSS13 are able to enhance the cell-cell membrane fusion and cleavage of spike protein. Overall, we demonstrate that TMPRSS13 is another host serine protease promoting the membrane-fusion entry of SADS-CoV, which may expand its host tropism by using diverse TTSPs.",

    "7": "Organophosphate pesticides (OPs) are widely utilized in agricultural production, and the residues threaten public health and environmental safety due to their toxicity. Herein, a novel and simple DNA aptamer-based sensor has been fabricated for the rapid, visual, and quantitative detection of profenofos and isocarbophos. The proposed DNA aptamers with a G-quadruplex spatial structure could be recognized by SYBR Green I (SG-I), resulting in strong green fluorescence emitted by SG-I. The DNA aptamers exhibit a higher specific binding ability to target OP molecules through aromatic ring stacking, disrupting the interaction between SG-I and DNA aptamers to induce green fluorescence quenching. Meanwhile, the fluorescence wavelength of G-quadruplex fluorescence emission peaks changes, accompanied by an obvious fluorescence variation from green to blue. SG-I-modified aptasensor without any additive reference fluorescence units for use in multicolor fluorescence assay for selective monitoring of OPs was first developed. The developed aptasensor provides a favorable linear range from 0 to 200 nM, with a low detection limit of 2.48 and 3.01 nM for profenofos and isocarbophos, respectively. Moreover, it offers high selectivity and stability in real sample detection with high recoveries. Then, a self-designed portable smartphone sensing platform was successfully used for quantitative result outputs, demonstrating experience in designing a neotype sensing strategy for point-of-care pesticide monitoring.",
    "8": "The role of phenotypic plasticity during colonization remains unclear due to the shifting importance of plasticity across timescales. In the early stages of colonization, plasticity can facilitate persistence in a novel environment; but over evolutionary time, processes such as genetic assimilation may reduce variation in plastic traits such that species with a longer evolutionary history in an environment can show lower levels of plasticity than recent invaders. Therefore, comparing species in the early stages of colonization to long-established species provides a powerful approach for uncovering the role of phenotypic plasticity during different stages of colonization. We compared gene expression between low-dissolved oxygen (DO) and high-DO populations of two cyprinid fish: Enteromius apleurogramma, a species that has undergone a recent range expansion, and E.\u2009neumayeri, a long-established native species in the same region. We sampled tissue either immediately after capture from the field or after a 2-week acclimation under high-DO conditions, allowing us to test for both evolved and plastic differences in low-DO vs high-DO populations of each species. We found that most genes showing candidate-evolved differences in gene expression did not overlap with those showing plastic differences in gene expression. However, in the genes that did overlap, there was counter-gradient variation such that plastic and evolved gene expression responses were in opposite directions in both species. Additionally, E.\u2009apleurogramma had higher levels of plasticity and evolved divergence in gene expression between field populations. We suggest that the higher level of plasticity and counter-gradient variation may have allowed rapid genetic adaptation in E.\u2009apleurogramma and facilitated colonization. This study shows how counter-gradient variation may impact the colonization of divergent oxygen environments.",

Herein, four pyrite/sawdust composite-based biofilters were established to treat simulated secondary effluent for 304 days. The results demonstrated that effluent TN and TP concentrations from biofilters under the optimal hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3.5 h were stable at <2.0 and 0.1 mg/L, respectively, and no significant differences were observed between inoculated sludge sources. The pyrite/sawdust composite-based biofilters had low N",
    "12": "The intestinal microbiota, consisting of an estimated 10^10-10^11 organisms, regulate physiological processes involved in digestion, metabolism, and immunity. Surprisingly, these intestinal microorganisms have been found to influence tissues that are not directly in contact with the gut, such as adipose tissue, the liver, skeletal muscle, and the brain. This interaction takes place even when intestinal barrier function is uncompromised. An increasing body of evidence suggests that bacterial membrane vesicles (bMVs), in addition to bacterial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, are able to mediate effects of the microbiota on these host tissues. The ability of bMVs to dissipate from the intestinal lumen into systemic circulation hereby facilitates the transport and presentation of bacterial components and metabolites to host organs. Importantly, there are indications that the interaction between bMVs and tissues or immune cells may play a role in the etiology of (chronic metabolic) disease. For example, the gut-derived bMV-mediated induction of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells and pro-inflammatory signaling by adipocytes possibly underlies diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Here, we review the current knowledge on bMVs in the microbiota's effects on host energy/substrate metabolism with a focus on etiological roles in the onset and progression of metabolic disease. We furthermore illustrate that vesicle production by bacterial microbiota could potentially be modulated through lifestyle intervention to improve host metabolism.",
    "13": "The spatial structure of populations is key to many (eco-)evolutionary processes. In such cases, the strength and sign of selection on a trait may depend on the spatial scale considered. An example is the evolution of altruism: selection in local environments often favours cheaters over altruists, but this can be outweighed by selection at larger scales, favouring clusters of altruists over clusters of cheaters. For populations subdivided into distinct groups, this effect is described formally by multilevel selection theory. However, many populations do not consist of non-overlapping groups but rather (self-)organize into other ecological patterns. We therefore present a mathematical framework for multi",
