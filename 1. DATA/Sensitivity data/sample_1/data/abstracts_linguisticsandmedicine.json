The creative act of making music together offers the possibility to strengthen competences and make conflicts tangible. Besides its complementing of evidence-based biomedical care, there is little research on the feasibility and efficacy of interactive music therapy including the diagnosed child and their significant others.",
    "1": "Working memory (WM) has been consistently linked to reading. However, the mechanism(s) linking WM to reading remain unclear. WM may indirectly exert an effect onto reading through mediators such as phonemic awareness (PA) and/or rapid automatized naming (RAN). In a sample of children with reading difficulty (n\u2009=\u2009117), separate mediation analyses tested direct and indirect (through PA and RAN) effects of WM on untimed word decoding and recognition (i.e., basic reading skills) and timed word decoding and recognition (i.e., reading fluency). WM exerted a direct effect on basic reading skills and reading fluency. For basic reading skills, there was a significant indirect effect of WM on reading through the mediation of PA (but not through RAN). By contrast, for reading fluency, there was a significant indirect effect of WM on reading through the mediation of RAN (but not through PA). Findings reinforce the importance of WM, PA, and RAN for broad reading skills, while offering a mechanistic explanation for why poor PA and/or RAN may differentially lead to reading difficulty.",
    "2": "The semantic knowledge stored in our brains can be accessed from different stimulus modalities. For example, a picture of a cat and the word \"cat\" both engage similar conceptual representations. While existing research has found evidence for modality-independent representations, their content remains unknown. Modality-independent representations could be semantic, or they might also contain perceptual features. We developed a novel approach combining word/picture cross-condition decoding with neural network classifiers that learned latent modality-independent representations from MEG data (25 human participants: 15 female, 10 male). We then compared these representations to models representing semantic, sensory, and orthographic features. Results show that modality-independent representations correlate both with semantic and visual representations. There was no evidence that these results were due to picture-specific visual features or orthographic features automatically activated by the stimuli presented in the experiment. These findings support the notion that modality-independent concepts contain both perceptual and semantic representations.",
    "3": "When comprehending speech, listeners can use information encoded in visual cues from a face to enhance auditory speech comprehension. For example, prior work has shown that the mouth movements reflect articulatory features of speech segments and durational information, while pitch and speech amplitude are primarily cued by eyebrow and head movements. Little is known about how the visual perception of segmental and prosodic speech information is influenced by linguistic experience. Using eye-tracking, we studied how perceivers' visual scanning of different regions on a talking face predicts accuracy in a task targeting both segmental versus prosodic information, and also asked how this was influenced by language familiarity. Twenty-four native English perceivers heard two audio sentences in either English or Mandarin (an unfamiliar, non-native language), which sometimes differed in segmental or prosodic information (or both). Perceivers then saw a silent video of a talking face, and judged whether that video matched either the first or second audio sentence (or whether both sentences were the same). First, increased looking to the mouth predicted correct responses only for non-native language trials. Second, the start of a successful search for speech information in the mouth area was significantly delayed in non-native versus native trials, but just when there were only prosodic differences in the auditory sentences, and not when there were segmental differences. Third, (in correct trials) the saccade amplitude in native language trials was significantly greater than in non-native trials, indicating more intensely focused fixations in the latter. Taken together, these results suggest that mouth-looking was generally more evident when processing a non-native versus native language in all analyses, but fascinatingly, when measuring perceivers' latency to fixate the mouth, this language effect was largest in trials where only prosodic information was useful for the task.",
    "4": "Cancer prevention challenges in Ethiopia include limited community awareness and low uptake of screening, which are in part driven by a lack of culturally and linguistically relevant cancer education appropriate for the diverse indigenous communities of this never-colonized nation. In 2022, a comprehensive multi-media breast cancer (BC) awareness campaign was implemented, featuring local cancer experts and survivors, with community-based screening events in the towns of Adama and Mojo. The RE-AIM framework was used to evaluate and describe its reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Educational pamphlets, videos, social media posts, and interviews were distributed in person and through local and national media networks, reaching tens of millions of people and resulting in 525 individuals screened, with one diagnosis of early-stage cancer. During the free screening events, an interview-administered survey of BC knowledge, attitudes, and screening practices was conducted to inform future cancer education for this population. Among 287 survey respondents, about half correctly identified swelling (46%) or changing nipples/discharge (48.4%) as signs of BC. Maintenance challenges include the lack of a national screening program. Educational resources and a mobile app, translated into the local language, encourage continued patient empowerment to perform breast self-exams. In the absence of established BC prevention programs, \"pop-up\" mobile screening events can be effective for mobilizing communities to get screened. The paper highlights challenges and lessons gleaned from this community-based BC awareness campaign and screening event to inform future cancer education initiatives in Ethiopia and similar resource-limited settings.",
    "5": "Adding to limited research on clear speech in tone languages, productions of Mandarin lexical tones were examined in pentasyllabic sentences. Fourteen participants read sentences imagining a hard-of-hearing addressee or a friend in a casual social setting. Tones produced in clear speech had longer duration, higher intensity, and larger F0 values. This style effect was rarely modulated by tone, preceding tonal context, or syllable position, consistent with an overall signal enhancement strategy. Possible evidence for tone enhancement was observed only in one set of analysis for F0 minimum and F0 range, contrasting tones with low targets and tones with high targets.",
    "6": "Exploring the dynamic interface of environmental psychology and psycholinguistics, this investigation delves into how simulated weather conditions - sunny versus rainy - affect emotional perceptions of linguistic stimuli within a Virtual Reality (VR) framework. Participants assessed words' emotional valence being exposed to these distinct environmental simulations. Contrary to expectations, we found that while rainy conditions modestly prolonged response times, they did not significantly alter the emotional valence attributed to words. Our study shows that weather can affect emotional cognition, but intrinsic emotional word properties are resilient to environmental influences. This highlights the complex interplay between environmental factors and linguistic processing and reaffirms the importance of environmental contexts in cognitive and emotional evaluations, especially in the face of climate change. By integrating VR technology with environmental psychology and linguistics, our research offers novel insights into the subtle yet significant ways in which virtual and real-world environments converge to shape human emotional and cognitive responses.",

In 2021, the World Health Assembly endorsed a global target of a 40-percentage-point increase in effective coverage of refractive error by 2030. To achieve this global target, equitable access to refractive and optical services within community and primary care settings needs to be strengthened. This review will inform the development of technical guidance to support improvements in the testing and correction of refractive error among World Health Organization (WHO) member states.",

Using the electron microscopy technology, along with LipidTOX Deep Red neutral and Bodipy 493/503 staining assays, we observed that BPF treatment elicited a striking accumulation of lipid droplets in HepG2 cells, accompanied by an increased total level of triglycerides. At the molecular level, the lipogenesis-associated mRNAs and proteins, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins, increased significantly ",

The craniofacial relationship in patients with dentofacial deformities is still not understood, and transformations between facial and skeletal shapes remain a challenging task due to intricate anatomical structures and nonlinear relationships between the facial soft tissue and bones. In this study, a novel bidirectional 3-dimensional (3D) deep learning framework, named P2P-ConvGC, was developed and validated based on a large-scale data set for accurate subject-specific transformations between facial and skeletal shapes. Specifically, the 2-stage point-sampling strategy was used to generate multiple nonoverlapping point subsets to represent high-resolution facial and skeletal shapes. Facial and skeletal point subsets were separately input into the prediction system to predict the corresponding skeletal and facial point subsets via the skeletal prediction subnetwork and facial prediction subnetwork. For quantitative evaluation, the accuracy was calculated with shape errors and landmark errors between the predicted skeleton or face with corresponding ground truths. The shape error was calculated by comparing the predicted point sets with the ground truths, with P2P-ConvGC outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms including P2P-Net, P2P-ASNL, and P2P-Conv. The total landmark errors (Euclidean distances of craniomaxillofacial landmarks) of P2P-ConvGC in the upper skull, mandible, and facial soft tissues were 1.964 \u00b1 0.904 mm, 2.398 \u00b1 1.174 mm, and 2.226 \u00b1 0.774 mm, respectively. Furthermore, the clinical feasibility of the bidirectional model was validated using a clinical cohort. The result demonstrated its prediction ability with average surface deviation errors of 0.895 \u00b1 0.175 mm for facial prediction and 0.906 \u00b1 0.082 mm for skeletal prediction. To conclude, our proposed model achieved good performance on the subject-specific prediction of facial and skeletal shapes and showed clinical application potential in postoperative facial prediction and VSP for orthognathic surgery.",

    "15": "Glaucoma, an irreversible optic neuropathy, primarily affects retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and causes vision loss and blindness. The damage to RGCs in glaucoma occurs by various mechanisms, including elevated intraocular pressure, oxidative stress, inflammation, and other neurodegenerative processes. As the disease progresses, the loss of RGCs leads to vision loss. Therefore, protecting RGCs from damage and promoting their survival are important goals in managing glaucoma. In this regard, resveratrol (RES), a polyphenolic phytoalexin, exerts antioxidant effects and slows down the evolution and progression of glaucoma. The present review shows that RES plays a protective role in RGCs in cases of ischemic injury and hypoxia as well as in ErbB2 protein expression in the retina. Additionally, RES plays protective roles in RGCs by promoting cell growth, reducing apoptosis, and decreasing oxidative stress in H"
