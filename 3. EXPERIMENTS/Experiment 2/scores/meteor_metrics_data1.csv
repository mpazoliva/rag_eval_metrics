For example, prior work has shown that the mouth movements reflect articulatory features of speech segments and durational information, while pitch and speech amplitude are primarily cued by eyebrow and head movements. Little is known about how the visual perception of segmental and prosodic speech information is influenced by linguistic experience. Using eye-tracking, we studied how perceivers' visual scanning of different regions on a talking face predicts accuracy in a task targeting both segmental versus prosodic information, and also asked how this was influenced by language familiarity. Twenty-four native English perceivers heard two audio sentences in either English or Mandarin (an unfamiliar, non-native language), which sometimes differed in segmental or prosodic information (or both). Perceivers then saw a silent video of a talking face, and judged whether that video matched either the first or second audio sentence (or whether both sentences were the same). First, increased looking to the mouth predicted correct responses only for non-native language trials. Second, the start of a successful search for speech information in the mouth area was significantly delayed in non-native versus native trials, but just when there were only prosodic differences in the auditory sentences, and not when there were segmental differences. Third, (in correct trials) the saccade amplitude in native language trials was significantly greater than in non-native trials, indicating more intensely focused fixations in the latter.

The craniofacial relationship in patients with dentofacial deformities is still not understood, and transformations between facial and skeletal shapes remain a challenging task due to intricate anatomical structures and nonlinear relationships between the facial soft tissue and bones. In this study, a novel bidirectional 3-dimensional (3D) deep learning framework, named P2P-ConvGC, was developed and validated based on a large-scale data set for accurate subject-specific transformations between facial and skeletal shapes. Specifically, the 2-stage point-sampling strategy was used to generate multiple nonoverlapping point subsets to represent high-resolution facial and skeletal shapes. Facial and skeletal point subsets were separately input into the prediction system to predict the corresponding skeletal and facial point subsets via the skeletal prediction subnetwork and facial prediction subnetwork. For quantitative evaluation, the accuracy was calculated with shape errors and landmark errors between the predicted skeleton or face with corresponding ground truths. The shape error was calculated by comparing the predicted point sets with the ground truths, with P2P-ConvGC outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms including P2P-Net, P2P-ASNL, and P2P-Conv.

Vesicular trafficking from endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus is mediated by the coat protein complex II (COPII). A key component of COPII is small GTPase Sar1. Five Sar1 isoforms are encoded in the Arabidopsis genome and they show distinct while redundant roles in various cellular and developmental processes, especially in reproduction. Arabidopsis Sar1b is essential for sporophytic control of pollen development while Sar1b and Sar1c are critical for gametophytic control of pollen development. Because functional loss of Sar1b and Sar1c resulted in pollen abortion, whether they influence pollen tube growth was unclear. Here we demonstrate that Sar1b mediates pollen tube growth, in addition to its role in pollen development. Although functional loss of Sar1b does not affect pollen germination, it causes a significant reduction in male transmission and of pollen tube penetration of style. We further show that membrane dynamics at the apex of pollen tubes are compromised by Sar1b loss-of-function.
