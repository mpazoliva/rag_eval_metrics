1,What does non-differentiable mean here? If the problem with previous metrics is that they are not per-token differentiable then why are they looking for a way to optimize non-differentiable objectives?,"The ultimate aim of language technology is to interact with humans.However, most language models are trained without direct signals of human preference,with supervised target strings serving as (a sometimes crude) proxy.One option to incorporate user feedback is via human-in-the-loop, i.e., a user would be expected to provide feedback for each sample online as the model trains, but this degree of dense supervision is often prohibitive and inefficient.Automated metrics offer a promising compromise: learned models of human preference like BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019), BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020), summarization preferences (Wu et al., 2021) have significantly improved correlation with human judgment compared to earlier metrics (BLEU, METEOR, etc.), and are cheap to evaluate.

However, authors in this context use this idea of differentiability to explain that most automated metrics cannot provide quality estimates after a language model generates one token or a parietal output - similar to humans, they can provide quality estimates only after a language model generates a full sequence. This non-differentiability is pointed out as a problem by the authors for the new metrics (i.e. things like BLUERT or BERTScore) - it is unclear from this paper alone if previous vanilla metrics (i.e. BLEU) were per token differentiable or not. The authors are looking for ways to use these non-differentiable scores in RL frameworks, potentially as a reward function.","Sure! Here's my answer:

2,"Why is the action space of language modeling particularly large? Is it because of the vocab size? But then, moving in the real world also has a huge action space (degrees of movement).","Language generation action spaces are orders of magnitude larger than what most discrete action space RL algorithms are designed for (Ranzato et al., 2015; Ammanabrolu, 2021), e.g., GPT-2/3 and T5 have a vocabulary size of 50K and 32K respectively.We hypothesize that the size of the action space is a core cause of instability when training LMs with existing RL methods.To address this issue, we introduce NLPO (Natural Language Policy Optimization), which is inspired by work on action elimination/invalid-action masking (Zahavy et al., 2018; Huang & Ontañón, 2020; Ammanabrolu & Hausknecht, 2020). NLPO, a parameterized-masked extension of PPO, learns to mask out less relevant tokens in-context as it trains. NLPO accomplishes this via top-p sampling, which restricts tokens to the smallest possible set whose cumulative probability is greater than the probability parameter p (Holtzman et al., 2018). RL for Large Action Spaces. MIXER (Ranzato et al., 2015) combined ideas from schedule sampling and REINFORCE (Williams, 1992).Bahdanau et al. (2016) proposed an actor-critic algorithm to address the variance/large action space problems when using REINFORCE for language generation; follow-up works such asKG-A2C (Ammanabrolu & Hausknecht, 2020), TrufLL (Martin et al., 2022), AE-DQN (Zahavy et al., 2018), and GALAD (Ammanabrolu et al., 2022) addressed similar issues by attempting to eliminate and reduce the action space during exploration. Each environment is an NLP task: we are given a supervised dataset \mathcal{D}=\{({\bm{x}}^{i},{\bm{y}}^{i})\}_{i=1}^{N} of N examples, where {\bm{x}}\in\mathcal{X} is an language input and {\bm{y}}\in\mathcal{Y} is the target string. Generation can be viewed as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) \langle\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},\mathcal{R},P,\gamma,T\rangle using a finite vocabulary \mathcal{V}.Each episode in the MDP begins by sampling a datapoint ({\bm{x}},{\bm{y}}) from our dataset and ends when the current time step t exceeds the horizon T or an end of sentence (EOS) token is generated.The input {\bm{x}}=(x_{0},\cdots,x_{m}) is a task-specific prompt that is used as our initial state \bm{s}_{0}=(x_{0},\cdots,x_{m}), where \bm{s}_{0}\in\mathcal{S} and \mathcal{S} is the state space with x_{m}\in\mathcal{V}. An action in the environment a_{t}\in\mathcal{A} consists of a token from our vocabulary \mathcal{V}. The transition function P:\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{S} deterministically appends an action a_{t} to the end of the state \bm{s}_{t-1}=(x_{0},\cdots,x_{m},a_{0},\cdots,a_{t-1}). This continues until the end of the horizon t\leq T and we obtain a state \bm{s}_{T}=(x_{0},\cdots,x_{m},a_{0},\cdots,a_{T}).At the end of an episode a reward \mathcal{R}:\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{Y}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{1} that depends on the (\bm{s}_{T},{\bm{y}}) (e.g., an automated metric like PARENT Dhingra et al. (2019)) is emitted. RL4LMs provides an OpenAI gym (Brockman et al., 2016) styleAPI for an RL environmentthat simulates this LM-Based MDP formulation.Abstracting the details of the MDP environment structure allows for new tasks to be added quickly with compatibility across all implemented algorithms.","The action space for language modeling is equal to the vocabulary set of language models. Since the vocabularies are very large (i.e. tens of thousands of possible tokens), the action space is also very large. In general, locomotion in the real world can be condensed to three quantities - moving across X, Y or Z axes, or a linear combination thereof. The authors mention that typical RL problems have an action space that is an order of magnitude smaller, but do not specifically explain how the action spaces for typical problems is modeled or constructed.","A task is a set of observations and corresponding outputs, along with a loss function that provides task-specific feedback, as defined by the context",0.1304347788586957,0.0175438564281323,0.1086956484239131,0.930282873998763,24.03674610641534,20.73081624508089,0.0404448938321536,0.002689376961004,0.1883354783058166,0.5284147228664152,0.2747636139392853,0.4009712636470794,0.0103060505110242,0.75,0.7108250304897488,0.7601683285281199
3,What do the equations for Q-value and value represent?,"RL4LMs supports fine-tuning and training LMs from scratch via on-policy actor-critic algorithms on language environments.Formally, this class of algorithms allows us to train a parameterized control policy defined as \pi_{\theta}:\mathcal{S}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}, a function that attempts to select an action in a given state so as to maximize long term discounted rewards over a trajectory \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[\sum_{t=0}^{T}\gamma^{t}\mathcal{R}(\bm{s}_{t},a_{t})].Our benchmark experiments focus on fine-tuning a pre-trained LM denoted as \pi_{0} from which we initial our agent’s policy \pi_{\theta}=\pi_{0}.Similarly, the value network V_{\phi} used to estimate the value function is also initialized from \pi_{0} except for the final layer which is randomly initialized to output a single scalar value.As with other deep RL actor-critic algorithms, we define our value and Q-value functions as V_{t}^{\pi}=\mathbb{E}_{a_{t}\sim\pi}[\sum_{\tau=t}^{T}\gamma R(\bm{s}_{\tau},a_{\tau},{\bm{y}})],Q_{t}^{\pi}(\bm{s}_{t},a_{t})=R(\bm{s}_{t},a_{t},{\bm{y}})+\gamma\mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1}\sim P}[V_{t+1}^{\pi}(\bm{s}_{t+1})]leading to a definition of our advantage function as A_{t}^{\pi}(\bm{s},a)=Q_{t}^{\pi}(\bm{s},a)-V_{t}^{\pi}.To increase training stability, advantage is appoximated using Generalized Advantage Estimation (Schulman et al., 2015).","Q and V are mathematically expressed as: V_{t}^{\pi}=\mathbb{E}_{a_{t}\sim\pi}[\sum_{\tau=t}^{T}\gamma R(\bm{s}_{\tau},a_{\tau},{\bm{y}})],Q_{t}^{\pi}(\bm{s}_{t},a_{t})=R(\bm{s}_{t},a_{t},{\bm{y}})+\gamma\mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1}\sim P}[V_{t+1}^{\pi}(\bm{s}_{t+1})] where R is the reward function, s means states, and the variable 'a' denotes actions.

4,Why is it helpful to mask out less relevant tokens if these are less likely to be sampled anyways?,"Specifically, NLPOmaintains a masking policy \pi_{\psi}: the masking policy is a copy of the current policy (\pi_{\theta}), but is updated only every \mu steps.A parameterized-invalid-mask is created from \pi_{\psi} by first selecting the top-p tokens from the vocabulary,444\pi_{\psi} could be trained with alternate sampling techniques like top-k or beam search (or even hard-coded via rules by domain experts), though we find top-p sampling to be most effective in practice. and then applying an invalid-mask to the remaining tokens—i.e. setting their probabilities to zero when sampling actions from \pi_{\theta} during training;this periodic updating policy \pi_{\psi} is inspired by off-policy Q-learning algorithms (Andrychowicz et al., 2017),providing the policy \pi_{\theta} with an additional constraint that balances between the benefits of containing more task relevant information than the KL penalty derived from \pi_{0} and the risk of reward hacking.We provide pseudocode in Algorithm 1 (green portions highlight the differences with PPO). PPO vs. NLPO.Figure 2 shows that NLPO generally outperforms PPO and supervised, especially when applied after supervised training.We hypothesize that the primary reason for NLPO’s improved performance and stability is because the masking policy provides an additional constraint for the current policy.This constraint is not based on the initial untuned policy like the KL penalty but of the policy from \mu iterations ago and likely contains more task-relevant information learned during RL training.Table 3 (and Appendix Table 8) shows how performance increases up to a point and then decreases as p in top-p sampling is increased for the masking policy, relaxing the constraint by eliminating less tokens at each step, implying that there is a balance to be found in how much the model should be constrained during RL training.","The authors hypothesize that their dynamic masking function helps because it adds a new constraint that the RL algorithm has to abide by. Additionally, since this is a dynamic function, being updated oftenly (every mu steps), it is likely that the masking function ensures that the selected top-p tokens are more relevant to the current state the RL algorithm needs to analyse and decide on.","KG-Classifier affects zero-shot fusion by enabling the delicate balancing between multiple knowledge sources based on KG-alignment awareness, leading to performance improvements in commonsense reasoning tasks",0.1095890365922313,0.0,0.0821917763182588,0.7500030225304521,23.102171797522,19.17732254895464,0.0370919881305637,0.0039525691699604,0.168989673256874,0.3933889705619143,0.164425253868103,0.3769250214099884,0.0021285268604458,0.6666666666666666,0.770961637632008,0.7544963850049473

However, the authors mention that one reason why NLPO outperforms PPO is probably because of this dynamic masking function that is updated occasionally - this indicates to us that mu is probably not an unbounded or very large number (if mu were very large, tending to infinity, the function would no longer be dynamic).","The combinatorial action space is the set of all possible sequences of tokens that can be generated by the language model, which is orders of magnitude larger than the action spaces of most discrete action space RL algorithms.

The four selected combinations arelisted in Table 1 and optimized images using each are shown for the “Gorilla” class output unit in Figure 4. Of the four, some show highfrequency information, others low frequency; some contain densepixel data, and others contain only sparse outlines of importantregions.We found the version in the lower-left quadrant to be the best single set of hyperparameters, but often greater intuition canbe gleaned by considering all four at once.Figure 5 shows the optimization results computed for a selection of units on all layers.

In YOLO, the location predictions are made relative to the location of the grid cell, which means that the predictions are bound between 0 and 1. Using an exponential function, such as the softmax function, helps to concentrate the predictions around the center of the grid cell, making it more likely to detect objects near the center of the cell. This is particularly useful when objects are densely packed and have similar sizes, as it allows the network to distinguish between objects that are close to each other",0.1636363588743803,0.0405405359057711,0.1636363588743803,1.48889820955865,22.05468843235942,18.968137609217216,0.1914488360867466,0.0106007067137809,0.0631375014781951,0.5081667762588995,0.307814858853817,0.5214883685112,0.0205026463852891,0.0,0.7648262314678203,0.7799832211776818
9,Does the paper's DNN use a a larger width kernel or multiple smaller width kernels? ,"Gaussian blur: Producing images via gradient ascent tends to produce examples with high frequency information (see Supplementary Section S1 for a possible reason). While these images cause high activations, they are neither realistic nor interpretable (Nguyen et al., 2014). A useful regularization is thus to penalize high frequency information. We implement this as a Gaussian blur step rθ (x) = GaussianBlur(x, θb width). Convolving with a blur kernel is more computationally expensive than the other regularization methods, so we added another hyperparameter θb every to allow, for example, blurring every several optimization steps instead of every step. Blurring an image multiple times with a small width Gaussian kernel is equivalent to blurring once with a larger width kernel, and the effect will be similar even if the image changes slightly during the optimization process. This technique thus lowers computational costs without limiting the expressiveness of the regularization.

10,Why did the authors choose the four particular regularizations instead of others?,"We investigated the following four regularizations. All are designed to overcome different pathologies commonly encountered by gradient descent without regularization. Gaussian blur: Producing images via gradient ascent tends to produce examples with high frequency information (see Supplementary Section S1 for a possible reason). While these images cause high activations, they are neither realistic nor interpretable (Nguyen et al., 2014). A useful regularization is thus to penalize high frequency information. We implement this as a Gaussian blur step r_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})=\mathrm{GaussianBlur}(\mathbf{x},\theta_{\mathrm{b\_width}}). Convolving with a blur kernel is more computationally expensive than the other regularization methods, so we added another hyperparameter \theta_{\mathrm{b\_every}} to allow, for example, blurring every several optimization steps instead of every step. Blurring an image multiple times with a small width Gaussian kernel is equivalent to blurring once with a larger width kernel, and the effect will be similar even if the image changes slightly during the optimization process. This technique thus lowers computational costs without limiting the expressiveness of the regularization. Mahendran & Vedaldi (2014) used a penalty with a similar effect to blurring, called total variation, in their work reconstructing images from layer codes. The second tool — new regularizations that enable improved, interpretable, optimized visualizations of learned features — will help researchers and practitioners understand, debug, and improve their models. The visualizations also reveal a new twist in an ongoing story. Previous studieshave shown that discriminative networks can easily be fooled or hacked by the addition of certain structurednoise in image space (Szegedy et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2014).An oft-cited reason for this property is that discriminative training leads networksto ignore non-discriminative information in their input, e.g. learning to detect jaguars by matching the unique spots on their fur while ignoring the fact that they have four legs. For this reason it has been seen as a hopeless endeavor to create a generative model in which one randomly samples an x from a broad distribution on the space of all possible imagesand then iteratively transforms x into a recognizable image by moving it to a region that satisfies both a prior p(x) and posterior p(y|x) for some class label y.Past attempts have largely supported this view by producing unrealistic images using this method (Nguyen et al., 2014; Simonyan et al., 2013). Paragraph 10 : L2 decay: A common regularization, L2 decay penalizes large values and is implemented as rθ (x) = (1−θdecay)·x. L2 decay tends to prevent a small number of extreme pixel values from dominating the example image. Such extreme single-pixel values neither occur naturally with great frequency nor are useful for visualization. Paragraph 11 :Clipping pixels with small norm: The first two regularizations suppress high amplitude and high frequency information, so after applying both, we are left with an x∗ that contains somewhat small, somewhat smooth values. However, x∗ will still tend to contain non-zero pixel values everywhere. Even if some pixels in x∗ show the primary object or type of input causing the unit under consideration to activate, the gradient with respect to all other pixels in x∗ will still generally be non-zero, so these pixels will also shift to show some pattern as well, contributing in whatever small way they can to ultimately raise the chosen unit’s activation. We wish to bias the search away from such behavior and instead show only the main object, letting other regions be exactly zero if they are not needed. Paragraph 12 : Clipping pixels with small contribution: Instead of clipping pixels with small norms, we can try something slightly smarter and clip pixels with small contributions to the activation.","Authors mainly introduce four different and newly used regularizations that would help researchers in visualizing responses from different layers. These regularizations are designed to overcome different pathologies commonly encountered by gradient descent without regularization : L2 decay to penalize large pixel values which do not naturally occur, Gaussian blur:a useful regularization to iteratively penalize high frequency information associated with generated images via gradient ascent through each optimization step, Clipping pixels with small norm or Clipping pixels with small contribution.","Sure!

11,"What is meant by ""linear sweep"" in hyperparameter space?","Figure 3. The effects of each regularization method from Section 3 when used individually. Each of the four rows shows a linear sweep in hyperparameter space from no regularization (left) to strong regularization (right). When applied too strongly, some regularizations cause the optimization to fail (e.g. L2 decay, top row) or the images to be less interpretable (small norm and small contribution clipping, bottom two rows). For this reason, a random hyperparameter search was useful for finding joint hyperparameter settings that worked well together (see Figure 4). Best viewed electronically, zoomed in.",linear sweep can be seen as a regular increment in the values of some regularization hyperparameter (from leftmost where there is no regularization to rightmost where strong regularization occur ) to see the variation of their effects on the corresponding activations.,a 128-dimensional bottleneck embedding,0.0526315770637119,0.0,0.0526315770637119,0.8522452865706931,10.95527342875028,9.327909012059434,0.0127877237851662,0.0009990009990009,0.0864209681749343,0.3242332360793635,0.086420938372612,0.0402770414948463,0.0010820772769205,,0.6997676445955645,0.7585780448473394
12,What are the examples of the tools that enable understanding of Neural Networks for newcomers in deep learning? ,"The first tool is software that interactively plots the activations produced on each layer of a trained DNN for user-provided images or video. Static images afford a slow, detailed investigation of a particular input, whereas video input highlights the DNNs changing responses to dynamic input. At present, the videos are processed live from a user’s computer camera, which is especially helpful because users can move different items around the field of view, occlude and combine them, and perform other manipulations to actively learn how different features in the network respond. The second tool — new regularizations that enable improved, interpretable, optimized visualizations of learned features — will help researchers and practitioners understand, debug, and improve their models.

13,How did the authors compute the contributions of the pixels in order to clip the pixels with smaller contributions?,"Clipping pixels with small contribution: Instead of clipping pixels with small norms, we can try something slightly smarter and clip pixels with small contributions to the activation. One way of computing a pixel’s contribution to an activation is to measure how much the activation increases or decreases when the pixel is set to zero; that is, to compute the contribution as |a_{i}(\mathbf{x})-a_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{-j})|, where \mathbf{x}_{-j} is \mathbf{x} but with the j^{th} pixel set to zero. This approach is straightforward but prohibitively slow, requiring a forward pass for every pixel. Instead, we approximate this process by linearizing a_{i}(\mathbf{x}) around \mathbf{x}, in which case the contribution of each dimension of \mathbf{x} can be estimated as the elementwise product of \mathbf{x} and the gradient. We then sum over all three channels and take the absolute value, computing \left|\sum_{c}\mathbf{x}\circ\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}a_{i}(\mathbf{x})\right|. We use the absolute value to find pixels with small contribution in either direction, positive or negative. While we could choose to keep the pixel transitions where setting the pixel to zero would result in a large activation increase, these shifts are already handled by gradient ascent, and here we prefer to clip only the pixels that are deemed not to matter, not to take large gradient steps outside the region where the linear approximation is most valid. We define this r_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) as the operation that sets pixels with contribution under the \theta_{\mathrm{c\_pct}} percentile to zero.","Calculating absolute difference between some neuron activation of an input and the activation for same input without certain pixel can be considered a way of measuring the contribution of that pixel in the total response of the neuron. To ensure faster computation, we can estimate activation near the input with 1st order approximation (linear) and hence this leads  to total contribution estimated as the element wise product of the activation gradient and the input x (each element in this product shows how this pixel affects the total response ), we repeat this product for all different channels ,sum them all, and take absolute value  to find pixels with small contribution in either direction, positive or negative to get rid of.",The role of epoch in self-supervised learning is to determine the number of training iterations required to achieve optimal performance,0.086021502254596,0.0,0.086021502254596,0.4306318333712789,18.57948126802814,15.74282112766018,0.057712341134801,0.0017667844522968,0.2308849543333053,0.4900849935639891,0.2232515662908554,0.2945373058319092,0.0159782543445745,0.5,0.7519899725997324,0.7445195092295622

Another is the deconvolution method of Zeiler & Fergus (2013), which highlights the portions of a particular image that are responsible for the firing of each neural unit. Network-centric approaches investigate a network directly without any data from a dataset. For example, Erhan et al. (2009) synthesized images that cause high activations for particular units. Starting with some initial input \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x_{0}}, the activation a_{i}(\mathbf{x}) caused at some unit i by this input is computed, and then steps are taken in input spacealong the gradient \partial a_{i}(\mathbf{x})/\partial\mathbf{x} to synthesize inputs that cause higher and higher activations of unit i, eventually terminating at some \mathbf{x^{*}} which is deemed to be a preferred input stimulus for the unit in question. In the case where the input space is an image, \mathbf{x^{*}} can be displayed directly for interpretation.

17,"What is meant by ""hacks""?","These gradient-based approaches are attractive in their simplicity, but the optimization process tends to produce images that do not greatly resemble natural images. Instead, they are composed of a collection of “hacks” that happen to cause high (or low) activations: extreme pixel values, structured high frequency patterns, and copies of common motifs without global structure (Simonyan et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2014; Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014). The fact that activations may be effected by such hacks is better understood thanks to several recent studies. Specifically, it has been shown that such hacks may be applied to correctly classified images to cause them to be misclassified even via imperceptibly small changes (Szegedy et al., 2013), that such hacks can be found even without the gradient information to produce unrecognizable “fooling examples” (Nguyen et al., 2014), and that the abundance of non-natural looking images that cause extreme activations can be explained by the locally linear behavior of neural nets(Goodfellow et al., 2014).",'Hacks' means that they are not likely to naturally exist (non-natural looking images). However they may even cause harmful changes in the response of the network. Adversarial points for instance are examples of such hacks where slight increments in pixels of even correctly classified images can make them fool the network and tend to go beyond there original part of space and hence be misclassified.,"Mutual information means the mutual dependence between two random variables, which is a measure of how much one variable tells us about the other.

21,"For the paper's pretrained DNN, if the input does not contain a training set class, why does the probability vector show sensitivity towards the noise in input?","•One of the most interesting conclusions so far has been that representations on some layers seem to be surprisingly local. Instead of finding distributed representations on all layers, we see, for example, detectors for text, flowers, fruit, and faces on \mathsf{conv4} and \mathsf{conv5}. These conclusions can be drawn either from the live visualization or the optimized images (or, best, by using both in concert) and suggest several directions for future research (discussed in Section 4).•When using direct file input to classify photos from Flickr or Google Images, classifications are often correct and highly confident (softmax probability for correct class near 1). On the other hand, when using input from a webcam, predictions often cannot be correct because no items from the training set are shown in the image. The training set’s 1000 classes, though numerous, do not cover most common household objects. Thus, when shown a typical webcam view of a person with no ImageNet classes present, the output has no single high probability, as is expected. Surprisingly, however, this probability vector is noisy and varies significantly in response to tiny changes in the input, often changing merely in response to the noise from the webcam. We might have instead expected unchanging and low confidence predictions for a given scene when no object the network has been trained to classify is present. Plotting the fully connected layers (\mathsf{fc6} and \mathsf{fc7}) also reveals a similar sensitivity to small input changes.•Although the last three layers are sensitive to small input changes, much of the lower layer computation is more robust. For example, when visualizing the \mathsf{conv5} layer, one can find many invariant detectors for faces, shoulders, text, etc. by moving oneself or objects in front of the camera. Even though the 1000 classes contain no explicitly labeled faces or text, the network learns to identify these concepts simply because they represent useful partial information for making a later classification decision. One face detector, denoted \mathsf{conv5_{151}} (channel number 151 on \mathsf{conv5}), is shown in Figure 2 activating for human and lion faces and in Figure 1 activating for a cat face. Zhou et al. (2014) recently observed a similar effect where convnets trained only to recognize different scene types — playgrounds, restaurant patios, living rooms, etc. — learn object detectors (e.g. for chairs, books, and sofas) on intermediate layers.","The reason is that convolution layers learn parameters that can extract useful information and relations from the feature map that can help it afterwards to judge and give suitable responses of what this category is. Responses from learned detectors can resemble among some set of categories and can also differ among other set of categories. Input -not being in the training classes- still has a feature map that different layers would respond to according to those different detectors which the network has already learned and would still give a probability vector which may not be accurate. Hence, having noise in the input can stimulate different detectors to respond and fire different activations that would lead to changes in the probability output vector.","Yes.

22,"The paper wished to only show the main object , letting other regions be exactly zero if they are not needed. How did the authors achieve it?","Clipping pixels with small norm: The first two regularizations suppress high amplitude and high frequency information, so after applying both, we are left with an \mathbf{x^{*}} that contains somewhat small, somewhat smooth values. However, \mathbf{x^{*}} will still tend to contain non-zero pixel values everywhere. Even if some pixels in \mathbf{x^{*}} show the primary object or type of input causing the unit under consideration to activate, the gradient with respect to all other pixels in \mathbf{x^{*}} will still generally be non-zero, so these pixels will also shift to show some pattern as well, contributing in whatever small way they can to ultimately raise the chosen unit’s activation. We wish to bias the search away from such behavior and instead show only the main object, letting other regions be exactly zero if they are not needed. We implement this bias using an r_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) that computes the norm of each pixel (over red, green, and blue channels) and then sets any pixels with small norm to zero. The threshold for the norm, \theta_{\mathrm{n\_pct}}, is specified as a percentile of all pixel norms in \mathbf{x}.",The paper reaches this goal by calculating each pixel norm over the 3 colour channels and zeroing out small-norm pixels according to some threshold (the percentile of all pixel norms in x).,The loss was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the reconstructed image (the sum of network input and output) and ground truth,0.1960784266051519,0.0,0.1568627403306422,2.888679060775857,22.792834500792804,20.47976300641804,0.1569413716814159,0.0075290896646132,0.3450377285480499,0.4607909670269438,0.3450378477573395,0.6916736364364624,0.0166188045450795,,0.7646040004580597,0.8059084427028957

While it is possible to manipulate the content and style representations of an image independently, it is not possible to fully or completely separate them. This is because image content and style are inherently intertwined, and there usually does not exist an image that perfectly matches both constraints at the same time. The loss function used during image synthesis contains two terms for content and style, respectively, that are well separated, but there is a trade-off between the two. A strong emphasis on style will result in images that match the appearance of the artwork, but hardly show any of the photograph's content, while a strong emphasis on content will result in images that clearly identify the photograph, but the style of the painting is not as well-matched. Therefore, the separation of image content and style is a continuous and graded process, rather than a binary one",0.1093749957629396,0.0,0.0781249957629396,0.1292654159128907,11.951009931827349,9.855043942182403,0.0977198697068403,0.0101732196865548,-0.0430361777544021,0.4702125350576644,0.1190058141946792,0.4174440801143646,0.0255281072868674,0.0,0.7385682570379869,0.7497152908369393
25,"The paper's model implies that the discriminative parameters also contain significant “generative” structure from the training dataset. What is meant by ""generative"" structure?","However, the results presented here suggest an alternate possibility: the previously used priors may simply have been too weak (see Section S1 for one hypothesis of why a strong p(x) model is needed). With the careful design or learning of a p(x) model that biases toward realism,one may be able to harnessthe large number of parameters present in a discriminately learned p(y|x) modelto generate realistic images by enforcing probability under both models simultaneously.Even with the simple, hand-coded p(x) models we use in this paper as regularizers, complex dependencies between distant pixels already arise (cf. the beetles with structure spanning over 100 pixels in Figure 4). This implies that the discriminative parameters also contain significant “generative” structure from thetraining dataset; that is, the parameters encodenot only the jaguar’s spots, but to some extent also its four legs.With better, learned probabilistic models over the input and activations of higher layers, much more structure may be apparent. Work by Dai et al. (2015) shows some interesting results in this direction.While the images generated in this paper are far from being photo-realistic, they do suggest thattransferring discriminatively trained parameters to generative models — opposite the direction of the usual unsupervised pretraining approach — may be a fruitful area for further investigation.","Generative structure is how the data is distributed inside the space where it lives, for example when learning to detect jaguar class, parameters encode not only the jaguar’s spots(Only to distinguish it through a rare property), but to some extent also its four legs(to learn the pattern with which the whole creature can be found). So, discriminative parameters also contain significant “generative” structure.","The ""generative"" structure refers to the ability of the model to generate realistic images, beyond just recognizing the training data",0.1159420252720018,0.0,0.086956518025625,0.809078048613971,28.644448447879245,24.66818694128696,0.1074601357560904,0.0034364261168384,0.7500528693199158,0.562450190768739,0.754930853843689,0.5112212896347046,0.0214555313571435,0.6666666666666666,0.88068879152648,0.8682096491916883
26,How does the performance change when a dense retriever is evaluated on out-of-domain queries and documents that are different from the domain on which the retriever was trained?,"However, as shown in Thakur et al. (2021b), dense retrieval methods require large amounts of training data to work well.333For reference, the popular MS MARCO dataset (Nguyen et al., 2016) has about 500k training instances; the Natural Questions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) has more than 100k training instances.  Most importantly, dense retrieval methods are extremely sensitive to domain shifts: Models trained on MS MARCO perform rather poorly for questions for COVID-19 scientific literature (Wang et al., 2020; Voorhees et al., 2021). The MS MARCO dataset was created before COVID-19, hence, it does not include any COVID-19 related topics and models did not learn how to represent this topic well in a vector space. We use the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset Nguyen et al. (2016) as the data from the source domain. It has 8.8M passages and 532.8K query-passage pairs labeled as relevant in the training set. As Table 1 shows, a state-of-the-art dense retrieval model, achieving an MRR@10 of 33.2 points on the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset, performs poorly on the six selected domain-specific retrieval datasets when compared to simple BM25 lexical search. So far, ICT and CD have only been studied on in-domain performance, i.e. a large in-domain labeled dataset is available which is used for subsequent supervised fine-tuning. SimCSE, CT, and TSDAE have been only studied for unsupervised sentence embedding learning. As our results show in Appendix E, they do not work at all for purely unsupervised dense retrieval. If these pre-training approaches can be used for unsupervised domain adaptation for dense retrieval was so far unclear. In this work, we transfer the setup from Wang et al. (2021) to dense retrieval and first pre-train on the target corpus, followed by supervised training on labeled data from MS MARCO Nguyen et al. (2016). Performance is then measured on the target corpus.","It is said that when evaluating a retriever trained on a source domain in an out-of-domain setting, the performance is obtained lower than BM25. Also, dense retrievers are said to be sensitive to domain shift and models that perform well on MS MARCO do not perform well on COVID-19 data. There have been many studies on unsupervised sentence embedding learning, but it is said that they do not work well in unsupervised dense retrieval. Therefore, the performance of the retriever in out-of-domain may be worse.","Sure! Here's my answer:

30,"What if a query term can be matched to multiple document terms? Does MaxSim suffice for capturing query-document relevance, for this case too?","Using E_{q} and E_{d}, ColBERT computes the relevance score between q and d via late interaction, which we define as a summation of maximum similarity (MaxSim) operators. In particular, we find the maximum cosine similarity of each v\in E_{q} with vectors in E_{d}, and combine the outputs via summation. Besides cosine, we also evaluate squared L2 distance as a measure of vector similarity. Intuitively, this interaction mechanism softly searches for each query term t_{q}—in a manner that reflects its context in the query—against the document’s embeddings, quantifying the strength of the “match” via the largest similarity score between t_{q} and a document term t_{d}. Given these term scores, it then estimates the document relevance by summing the matching evidence across all query terms. Given the representation of a query q and a document d, the relevance score of d to q, denoted as S_{q,d}, is estimated via late interaction between their bags of contextualized embeddings. As mentioned before, this is conducted as a sum of maximum similarity computations, namely cosine similarity (implemented as dot-products due to the embedding normalization) or squared L2 distance.","if a query term can be matched to multiple document terms, MaxSim suffice for capturing query-document relevance.

33,"If both queries and documents are short, is still the fine-granular interaction required?","These increasingly expressive architectures are in tension. While interaction-based models (i.e., Figure 2 (b) and (c)) tend to be superior for IR tasks (Guo et al., 2019; Mitraet al., 2018), a representation-focused model—by isolating the computations among q and d—makes it possible to pre-compute document representations offline (Zamani et al., 2018), greatly reducing the computational load per query. In this work, we observe that the fine-grained matching of interaction-based models and the pre-computation of document representations of representation-based models can be combined by retaining yet judiciously delaying the query–document interaction. Figure 2 (d) illustrates an architecture that precisely does so. As illustrated, every query embedding interacts with all document embeddings via a MaxSim operator, which computes maximum similarity (e.g., cosine similarity), and the scalar outputs of these operators are summed across query terms. This paradigm allows ColBERT to exploit deep LM-based representations while shifting the cost of encoding documents offline and amortizing the cost of encoding the query once across all ranked documents. Additionally, it enables ColBERT to leverage vector-similarity search indexes (e.g., (Johnsonet al., 2017; Abuzaidet al., 2019)) to retrieve the top-k results directly from a large document collection, substantially improving recall over models that only re-rank the output of term-based retrieval.","During indexing, we use another server with the same CPU and system memory specifications but which has four Titan V GPUs attached, each with 12 GiBs of memory.

35,"How much does the late interaction decrease computational costs, and how close is the performance of the late interaction model to the early interaction model?","In contrast with this trend, ColBERT (which employs late interaction over BERT{}_{\textnormal{base}}) performs no worse than the original adaptation of BERT{}_{\textnormal{base}} for ranking by Nogueira and Cho (Nogueira and Cho, 2019; Nogueiraet al., 2019b) and is only marginally less effective than BERT{}_{\textnormal{large}} and our training of BERT{}_{\textnormal{base}} (described above). While highly competitive in effectiveness, ColBERT is orders of magnitude cheaper than BERT{}_{\textnormal{base}}, in particular, by over 170\times in latency and 13,900\times in FLOPs. This highlights the expressiveness of our proposed late interaction mechanism, particularly when coupled with a powerful pre-trained LM like BERT. While ColBERT’s re-ranking latency is slightly higher than the non-BERT re-ranking models shown (i.e., by 10s of milliseconds), this difference is explained by the time it takes to gather, stack, and transfer the document embeddings to the GPU. In particular, the query encoding and interaction in ColBERT consume only 13 milliseconds of its total execution time. We note that ColBERT’s latency and FLOPs can be considerably reduced by padding queries to a shorter length, using smaller vector dimensions (the MRR@10 of which is tested in §4.5), employing quantization of the document vectors, and storing the embeddings on GPU if sufficient memory exists. We leave these directions for future work.","In contrast with this trend, ColBERT (which employs late interaction over BERT performs no worse than the original adaptation of BERT for ranking and is only marginally less effective than BERT and our training of BERT.

44,Does the paper show that the learnt user intents by clustering are orthogonal to the sequence embeddings?,"Effectively modeling latent intentsfrom user behaviorsposes two challenges.First,it is extremely difficult to learn latent intents accuratelybecause we have no labelling data for intents.The only available supervision signals for intents are the user behavior data. Nevertheless, as aforementioned example indicates, distinct behaviors may reflect the same intent.Besides,effectively fusing intent informationinto a SR model is non-trivial.The target in SR is to predict next items in sequences, which is solved by encoding sequences.Leveraging latent intents of sequences into the model requires the intentfactors to be orthogonal to the sequence embeddings,which otherwise would induce redundant information. To discover the benefits oflatent intentsand address challenges,we propose theIntent Contrastive Learning (ICL),a general learning paradigm thatleverages the latent intentfactor into SR.It learns users’ intentdistributionsfrom all user behavior sequencesvia clustering.And it leveragesthe learnt intentsinto the SR modelvia a new contrastive SSL,whichmaximizes the agreementbetween a view of sequenceand its corresponding intent.The intent representation learning moduleand the contrastive SSL module are mutually reinforcedto train a more expressivesequence encoder.We tackle the challenge of intentmining problem byintroducing alatent variable to represent users’ intentsand learn them alternatelyalong with the SR model optimization throughan expectation-maximization (EM) frameworkto ensure convergence.We suggest fusing learnt intent informationinto SR via the proposed contrastive SSL,as it can improve model’s performance as wellas robustness.Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasetsfurther verify the effectiveness of the proposed learning paradigm,which improves performance and robustness,even when recommender systemsfaceheavy data sparsity issues.","No, it does not.","Catastrophic forgetting refers to the phenomenon where a model, after being fine-tuned on a small dataset, forgets the knowledge it previously learned during pretraining, resulting in poor performance on both the original and fine-tuning tasks",0.0571428551183674,0.0,0.0571428551183674,0.0466014729068125,1.5734107578688723,1.9802339844438668,0.108695652173913,0.0101892285298398,0.0773082748055458,0.1633763611316681,0.0773082673549652,,0.0091098714129934,,0.7275525128691389,0.7250199503342043

46,Does the parallelization of transformer part of the proposed method reduce time complexity effectively?,"In every iteration of the training phase,the computation costsof our proposed methodare mainly fromthe E-step estimation of Q(\cdot) and M-step optimization of \thetawith multi-tasks training.For the E-step,the time complexity is O(|U|mKd) from clustering, where d is the dimensionalityof the embedding and m is themaximum iteration number in clustering (m=20 in this paper).For the M-step,since we have three objectivesto optimize the network f_{\theta}(\cdot),the time complexity is O(3⋅(|U|2d+|U|d2)O(3\cdot(|U|^{2}d+|U|d^{2})italic_O ( 3 ⋅ ( | italic_U | start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d + | italic_U | italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ).The overall complexity is dominated by the term O(3\cdot(|U|^{2}d)),which is 3 times of Transformer-based SR with only next item prediction objective, e.g., SASRec.Fortunately,the model can be effectively parallelized becausef_{\theta} is Transformer and we leave it in future work.In the testing phase,the proposed ICL as wellas the SeqCL objectivesare no longer needed, which yields themodel to have the sametime complexity as SASRec (O(d|V|)).The empirical time spending comparisonsare reported in Sec. 5.2.The convergence of ICL is guaranteedunder the generalized EM framework.Proof is provided in Appendix B.","Logically, yes.

50,How does the paper show that the clustering result can be interpreted as users' intent?,"The main goal of next item prediction task is to optimizeEq. (1).Assume that there are also K different user intents (e.g., purchasing holiday gifts, preparing for fishing activity, etc.)in a recommender system that formsthe intent variable c=\left\{c_{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{K}, thenthe probability of a user interacting with a certainitem can be rewritten as follows:(7)\begin{split}P_{\theta}(s^{u})=\mathbb{E}_{(c)}\left[P_{\theta}(s^{u},c)\right].\end{split}However, users intents are latent by definition.Because of the missing observation of variable c,we are in a ‘chicken-and-eggs’ situation thatwithout c, we cannot estimate parameter \theta,and without \theta we cannot inferwhat the value of c might be. The larger of the intent class number K means users can havemore diverseintentions.The larger value of the strength of SeqCL objective \betameans the ICL task contributes more tothe final model.The results on Yelp is shown in Figure 5.We find that: (1)ICLRec reaches itsbest performance when increasing K to 512,and then it starts to deteriorateas K become larger.When K is very small,the number of users undereach intent prototype can potentially be large.As a result, false-positive samples(i.e., users that actually have different intentsare considered as having the same intent erroneously)are introduced to the contrastive SSL,thus affecting learning.On the other hand, when K is too large,the number of users undereach intent prototype is small,the introduced false-negative sampleswill also impair contrastive SSL.In Yelp, 512 user intents summarizeusers’ distinct behaviors best.(2) A ‘sweet-spot’ of \lambda=0.5 canalso be found.It indicatesthat the ICL task can benefitthe recommendation predictionas an auxiliary task.The impact of the batch size and \beta are provided in Appendix D. Recently, many approaches have been proposed to studyusers’ intents forimproving recommendations (Wanget al., 2019b; Cenet al., 2020; Li et al., 2019; Liet al., 2021b).MCPRN (Wanget al., 2019b)designs mixture-channel purposerouting networks to adaptivelylearnusers’ different purchase purposesof each itemunder different channels (sub-sequences) for session-based recommendation.MITGNN(Liuet al., 2020a)proposes amulti-intenttranslation graph neural networkto mine users’ multiple intentsby considering the correlations of the intents.ICM-SR (Panet al., 2020)designs anintent-guided neighbor detectorto retrieve correctneighbor sessionsfor neighbor representation.Different from session-based recommendation,another line of worksfocus on modeling the sequentialdynamics of users’ interaction behaviorsin a longer time span.DSSRec (Maet al., 2020)proposes a seq2seq trainingstrategy using multiple future interactions as supervision and introducing an intent variable from her historical and future behavior sequences.The intent variable is used to capture mutual information between an individual user’s historical and future behavior sequences.Two users of similar intentsmight be far away in representation space.Unlike this work, our intent variable is learned over all users’ sequences and is used to maximize mutual information across different users with similar learned intents.ASLI (Tanjim et al., 2020)captures intentvia a temporal convolutionalnetwork with side information (e.g., user action types such asclick, add-to-favorite, etc.),and then use the learnedintents toguide SR model to predictthe next item.Instead, our methodcan learn users’ intentsbased on user interactiondata only.",It does not.

51,Why does the proposed method introduced EM framework to optimize the model (instead of directly optimizing the loss)?,"Later, we will show that a generalized Expectation-Maximization frameworkprovides a direction to address above problemwith a convergence guarantee.The basic idea of optimizing Eq. (7) via EMis to start with an initial guessof the model parameter \thetaand estimate the expected valuesof the missing variable c, i.e., the E-step.And once we have the values of c,we can maximize the Eq. (7) w.r.t theparameter \theta, i.e., the M step.We can repeat this iterative process until the likelihood cannot increase anymore.

55,What does the proposed method BUIR require instead of negative sampling for training?,"For all the datasets, BUIRid shows the substantially higher performance than the discriminative methods taking only user-id/item-id (i.e., BPR, NeuMF, CML, and SML).In particular, the sparser the training set becomes, the larger the performance improvement of BUIRid is achieved over the best baseline (denoted by Improvid).It is obvious that BUIRid is more robust to the extreme sparsity compared to the other baselines that are more likely to explicitly use “positive but unobserved” interactions as negative interactions when positive user-item interactions are more rarely observed.BUIRid is not affected by such inconsistent supervision from uncertain negative interactions because it directly optimizes the representations of users and items by using only positive interactions. As a solution to the aforementioned limitations, this paper proposes a novel OCCF framework, named as BUIR, which does not require the negative sampling at all for training the model.The main idea is, given a positive user-item interaction (u, v), to make representations for u and v similar to each other, in order to encode the preference information into the representations.However, a naive end-to-end learning framework that guides positive user-item pairs to be similar to each other without any negative supervision can easily converge to a collapsed solution – the encoder network outputs the same representations for all the users and items. First of all, the BPR framework that optimizes the cross-prediction score, q\left(f(u)\right)^{\top}f(v)+f(u)^{\top}q\left(f(v)\right), is not as effective as ours;it is even worse compared to the conventional BPR, which optimizes the inner-product score f(u)^{\top}f(v).This implies that the performance improvement of BUIR is mainly caused by our learning framework rather than its score modeling based on the predictor.In addition, even without the stochastic augmentation, the neighbor-based encoder (i.e., LGCN) based on the BUIR framework beats LGCN based on the BPR framework, which demonstrates that BUIR successfully addresses the issue of incorrect negative sampling.Lastly, our framework with the stochastic neighbor augmentation further improves the performance by taking benefits from various views of the positive user-item interactions for the optimization. This paper proposes a novel framework for learning the representations of users and items, termed as BUIR, to address the main challenges of the OCCF problem: the implicit assumption about negative interactions, and high sparsity of observed (positively-labeled) interactions.First, BUIR directly bootstraps the representations of users and items by minimizing their cross-prediction error.This makes BUIR use only partially-observed positive interactions for training the model, and accordingly, it can eliminate the need for negative sampling.In addition, BUIR is able to learn the augmented views of each positive interaction obtained from the neighborhood information, which further relieves the data sparsity issue of the OCCF problem.Through the extensive comparison with a wide range of OCCF methods, we demonstrate that BUIR consistently outperforms all the other baselines in terms of top-K recommendation.In particular, the effectiveness of BUIR becomes more significant for much sparse datasets in which the positively-labeled interactions are not enough to optimize the model as well as the assumption about negative interactions becomes less valid.Based on its great compatibility with existing user/item encoder networks, we expect that our BUIR framework can be a major solution for the OCCF problem, replacing the conventional BPR framework. Our extensive evaluation on real-world implicit feedback datasets shows that BUIR consistently performs the best for top-K recommendation among a wide range of OCCF methods.In particular, the performance improvement becomes more significant in sparser datasets, with the help of utilizing augmented views of positive interactions as well as eliminating the effect of uncertain negative interactions.In addition, comparison results on a downstream task, which classifies the items into their category, support that BUIR learns more effective representations than other OCCF baselines.",BUIR requires positive user-item pairs instead of negative sampling for training.,"Y, U, and V channels are the color channels in the YUV color space",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.425956120709106,9.319467090531829,0.0,0.0099009900990099,0.0934752896428108,0.2799566846202922,0.093475304543972,0.3598720133304596,0.0054973306470984,,0.7269251553911616,0.7044603476541061
56,Is it true that approximating the online encoder slowly make the target encoder keep from converging to the collapsed solution?,"Bypassing the collapsed solution.  It is obvious that the loss in Equation (3) admits the collapsed solution with respect to \theta and \xi, which means both the encoders generate the same representations for all users and items.For this reason, the conventional end-to-end learning strategy, which optimizes both f_{\theta} and f_{\xi} to minimize the loss (i.e., cross-prediction error), may easily lead to such collapsed solution.In contrast, our proposed framework updates each of the encoders in different ways.From Equation (4), the online encoder is optimized to minimize the loss, while the target encoder is updated to slowly approximate the online encoder.That is, the direction of updating the target encoder (\theta-\xi) totally differs from that of updating the online encoder (-\nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{L}_{\theta,\xi}),and this effectively keeps both the encoders from converging to the collapsed solution.Several recent work on bootstrapping-based representation learning (Grill et al., 2020; Chen and He, 2021) empirically demonstrated that this kind of dynamics (i.e., updating two networks differently) allows to avoid the collapsed solution without any explicit term to prevent it.",Approximating the online encoder keep the target encoder from converging to the collapsed solution.,VGG-net,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.725320839985692,3.193132148559165,0.0,0.0007137758743754,0.1667371690273285,0.0,0.1667371690273285,,0.0007548960415745,,0.7261064993776284,0.750887645807502
57,What component of the model eliminates the effect of uncertain negative interactions after the positive interaction augmentation?,"We argue that the above collapsed solution is incurred by the si\x02multaneous optimization of 𝑢 and 𝑣 within the end-to-end learning framework of a single encoder. Hence, we instead adopt the student\x02teacher-like network [6, 29] in which only the student’s output 𝑢 (and 𝑣) is optimized to predict the target 𝑣 (and 𝑢) presented by the teacher. Specifically, BUIR directly bootstraps1 the representations of users and items by employing two distinct encoder networks, referred to as online encoder and target encoder. The high-level idea is training only the online encoder for the prediction task between 𝑢 and 𝑣, where the target for its prediction is provided by the target encoder. That is, the online encoder is optimized so that its user (and item) vectors get closer to the item (and user) vectors com\x02puted by the target encoder. At the same time, the target encoder is updated based on momentum-based moving average [6, 8, 29] to slowly approximate the online encoder, which encourages to pro\x02vide enhanced representations as the target for the online encoder. By doing so, the online encoder can capture the positive relation\x02ship between 𝑢 and 𝑣 into the representations, while preventing the model from collapsing to the trivial solution without explicitly using any negative interactions for the optimization.",Online encoders prevent models from collapsing into trivial solutions without explicitly using negative interactions for optimization.,"The authors mean that in traditional object detection methods, the task is broken down into multiple steps, such as feature extraction, classifier training, and localization, but YOLO unifies these steps into a single regression problem, where the network directly predicts the bounding boxes and class probabilities for all objects in the image, simultaneously and end-to-end",0.0624999962500002,0.0,0.0624999962500002,0.1927136226501432,14.378556316677638,11.258607674031312,0.0465116279069767,0.0102707749766573,0.316617339849472,0.5056174409389496,0.3166173100471496,0.464357852935791,0.0086127111631489,,0.7445278525314771,0.7892781544287938
58,What are the benefits of using the predictor to calculate user-item interaction score instead of directly encoding into their inner product?,"Existing discriminative OCCF methods (Rendle et al., 2009; Hsieh et al., 2017) have tried to optimize the latent space where the user-item interactions are directly encoded into their inner product (or Euclidean distance).On the contrary, BUIR additionally uses the predictor to model their interaction, which results in the capability of encoding the high-level relationship between users and items into the representations.In conclusion, with the help of the predictor, BUIR accurately computes the user-item interaction scores as well as optimizes the representation without explicitly using negative samples.",Using predictor can optimize the representation without any negative sample.,The effectiveness of SqueezeNet's model compression would likely be even more significant if a significantly smaller CNN is used instead of AlexNet,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.96137979820965,11.221034848657236,0.1229508196721311,0.0099009900990099,0.2944614887237549,0.4276088422723949,0.2944614291191101,0.259217232465744,0.0056466896392576,,0.780567389318506,0.7639266440878532
59,"What does ""stochastic"" mean in the stochastic data augmentation technique that the author introduced?","In Figure 4, our stochastic data augmentation (i.e., P>0) brings a significant improvement compared to the case of using the fixed neighborhood information (i.e., P=0) as encoder inputs.This result shows that the augmented views of positive interactions encourage BUIR to effectively learn users’ preference on items even in much sparse dataset.Interestingly, in case of the Ciao dataset which is less sparse than CiteULike, the benefit of our augmentation linearly increases with the maximum drop probability.This is because there is room for producing more various views (i.e., larger perturbation) based on a relatively more number of neighbors, and it eventually helps to boost the recommendation performance.To sum up, our framework that adopts the neighbor augmentation function successfully relieves the data sparsity issue of the OCCF problem, by leveraging the augmented views of few positive interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a stochastic data augmentation technique to relieve the data sparsity problem in our framework.Motivated by the recent success of self-supervised learning in various domains (Chenet al., 2020; Devlinet al., 2019), we exploit augmented views of an input interaction, which are generated based on the neighborhood information of each user and item (i.e., the set of the items interacted with a user, and the users interacted with an item).The stochastic augmentation is applied to positive user-item pairs when they are passed to the encoder, so as to produce the different views of the pairs.To be precise, by making our encoder use a random subset of a user’s (and item’s) neighbors for the input features, it produces a similar effect to increasing the number of positive pairs from the data itself without any human intervention.In the end, BUIR is allowed to learn various views of each positive user-item pair.",Stochastic means it use random neighborhood information of each user and item during data augmentation.,"Sure!

60,What value of momentum coefficient (τ) makes the BULR model perform best?,"Implementation Details.  We implement the proposed framework and all the baselines by using PyTorch, and use the Adam optimizer to train them.For BUIR, we fix the momentum coefficient \tau to 0.995, and adopt a single linear layer for the predictor q_{\theta}.666We empirically found that these hyperparameters hardly affect the final performance of BUIR, and the sensitivity analysis on the parameters is provided in Section 4.6.The augmentation function \psi simply uses a uniform distribution for drawing a drop probability p\sim\mathcal{U}(0,1), where each user’s (item’s) neighbor is independently deleted with the probability p. Figure 6 clearly shows that the performance is hardly affected by \tau in the range of [0.9, 1.0).In other words, any values of \tau larger than 0.9 allow the target encoder to successfully provide the target representations to the online encoder, by slowly approximating the online encoder;on the contrary, BUIR cannot learn the effective representations at all in case that the target encoder is fixed (i.e., \tau=1).This observation is consistent with previous work on momentum-based moving average (Tarvainen andValpola, 2017; Heet al., 2020b; Grill et al., 2020) that showed all values of \tau between 0.9 and 0.999 can yield the best performance.Furthermore, BUIR performs the best with a single-layer predictor, because a multi-layer predictor makes it difficult to optimize the relationship between outputs of the two encoder networks.In conclusion, BUIR is more powerful even with fewer hyperparameters, compared to existing OCCF methods that include a variety of regularization terms or modeling components.",Model gets best performance when the value of parameter tau is larger or equal than 0.9 and smaller than 1.,The proper measure to quantify the difference in attention maps with different values of α would be to calculate the L2 distance or mean squared error (MSE) between the attention maps for each value of α,0.1632653012911288,0.0377358443574231,0.1224489747605166,1.9224361679877493,17.19761713446713,14.759694748792846,0.1638766519823788,0.0107913669064748,0.1788637191057205,0.5085308446836632,0.1788637787103653,0.5162410736083984,0.0092540237753324,0.0,0.7677016618384034,0.7776271346868006
61,"In BUIR, how does the online encoder updated compared to the target encoder?","BUIR makes use of two distinct encoder networks that have the same structure: online encoder f_{\theta} and target encoder f_{\xi}.They are parameterized by \theta and \xi, respectively.The key idea of BUIR is to train the online encoder by using outputs of the target encoder as its target, while gradually improving the target encoder as well.The main difference of BUIR from existing end-to-end learning frameworks is that f_{\theta} and f_{\xi} are updated in different ways.The online encoder is trained to minimize the error between its output and the target, whereas the target network is slowly updated based on the momentum update (Heet al., 2020b) so as to keep its output consistent. To sum up, the parameters of the online encoder and target encoder are optimized by(4)\begin{split}\theta&\leftarrow\theta-\eta\cdot\nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{L}_{\theta,\xi}\\\xi&\leftarrow\tau\cdot\xi+(1-\tau)\cdot\theta.\end{split}\eta is the learning rate for stochastic optimization, and \tau\in[0,1] is a momentum coefficient (also called as target decay) for momentum-based moving average.The online encoder f_{\theta} (and the predictor q_{\theta}) is effectively optimized by the gradients back-propagated from the loss (Equation (3)), while the target encoder f_{\xi} is updated as the moving average of the online encoder.By taking a large value of \tau, the target encoder slowly approximates the online encoder.This momentum-based update makes \xi evolve more slowly than \theta, which enables to bootstrap the representations by providing enhanced but consistent targets to the online encoders (Heet al., 2020b; Grill et al., 2020).Figure 1 illustrates the overall framework of BUIR with the simple one-hot encoders. Bypassing the collapsed solution.  It is obvious that the loss in Equation (3) admits the collapsed solution with respect to \theta and \xi, which means both the encoders generate the same representations for all users and items.For this reason, the conventional end-to-end learning strategy, which optimizes both f_{\theta} and f_{\xi} to minimize the loss (i.e., cross-prediction error), may easily lead to such collapsed solution.In contrast, our proposed framework updates each of the encoders in different ways.From Equation (4), the online encoder is optimized to minimize the loss, while the target encoder is updated to slowly approximate the online encoder.That is, the direction of updating the target encoder (\theta-\xi) totally differs from that of updating the online encoder (-\nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{L}_{\theta,\xi}),and this effectively keeps both the encoders from converging to the collapsed solution.Several recent work on bootstrapping-based representation learning (Grill et al., 2020; Chen and He, 2021) empirically demonstrated that this kind of dynamics (i.e., updating two networks differently) allows to avoid the collapsed solution without any explicit term to prevent it. Similarly to Section 3.2, the online encoder is trained by minimizing \mathcal{L}_{\theta,\xi}(\psi(u,\mathcal{V}_{u}),\psi(v,\mathcal{U}_{v})), and the target encoder is slowly updated by the momentum mechanism.After the optimization is finished, the interaction score is inferred by f_{\theta}(u,\mathcal{V}_{u}) and f_{\theta}(v,\mathcal{U}_{v}) (Equation (5)).Figure 2 shows an example of our data augmentation which injects a certain level of perturbations to the neighbors.","The online encoder is updated to minimize the error between the output and the target and updated by the gradients back-propagated from the loss, but target network is updated based on the momentum update and updated as the moving average of the online encoder .",The authors use a simple fully connected neural network and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for benchmarking on the MNIST dataset,0.2173912995841211,0.033898300718185,0.2173912995841211,1.9986978024115485,22.38122657514629,19.60688917957405,0.05720823798627,0.0052225814474011,0.2477371096611023,0.4648290260355602,0.2477370798587799,0.34312304854393,0.0141133861266732,,0.7516168930821822,0.7816623980487809
62,Why does assumning unobserved user-item pairs negative leads to limited performance for generative methods?,"Nevertheless, the negative sampling approach has critical limitations in the following aspects.First, the underlying assumption about negative interactions becomes less valid as user-item interactions get sparser.This is because as fewer positive interactions are observed, the number of ”positive but unobserved” interactions increases, which consequently makes it even harder to sample correct negative ones.Such uncertainty of supervision eventually degrades the performance for top-K recommendation.Second, the convergence speed and the final performance depend on the specific choice of distributions for negative sampling.For example, sampling negative pairs from a non-uniform distribution (Rendle andFreudenthaler, 2014; Dinget al., 2019) (e.g., the multinomial distribution which models the probability of each interaction being actually negative) can improve the final performance, but inevitably incurs high computational costs, especially when a lot of users and items should be considered.","Assuming unobserved user-item pairs negative leads to limited performance since there are some cases of positive but unobserved, and the number of this case is increased.",Use a Segmentation Network to combine global and local features,0.1142857102040817,0.0,0.1142857102040817,1.5880117714047368,16.949175715705287,14.55064539060019,0.0381679389312977,0.0041493775933609,0.0001080380752682,0.4515429586172104,0.0001079961584764,0.2562951445579529,0.0062947524291667,0.0,0.7627442916866332,0.7349703555552337
63,How did previous OCCF studies mitigated the problem of performance being largely depend on negative sampling distribution?,"However, since the negative interactions are not available in the OCCF problem, previous discriminative methods assume that all unobserved interactions are negative.In other words, for each user, the items that have not been interacted yet are regarded to be less preferred to positive items.In this sense, they either use all unobserved user-item interactions as negative or adopt a negative sampling, which randomly samples unobserved user-item interactions in a stochastic manner to alleviate the computational burden.For better recommendation performance and faster convergence, advanced negative sampling strategies (Rendle andFreudenthaler, 2014; Dinget al., 2019) are also proposed to sample from non-uniform distributions.",Previous OCCF studies assume that all unobserved interactions are negative to mitigate the problem of performance being largely depend on negative sampling distribution,Batch size matters in unsupervised representation learning because it affects the quality of the learned representation and the convergence speed of the method,0.0999999950500002,0.0,0.0999999950500002,1.958224832501124,24.470901100420857,19.44082662037625,0.0652173913043478,0.0103463787674313,0.1671516746282577,0.407841993294455,0.1671517491340637,0.2917800545692444,0.0077483691937784,0.3333333333333333,0.7700666604058973,0.773491545447354
64,How does the negative pairs prevent the problem of collapsed solution during optimization in contrastive learning methods?,"Pointing out that the contrastive methods need to carefully treat the negative instances during the training for effectiveness and efficiency, the most recent work proposed a bootstrapping-based self-supervised learning framework (Grill et al., 2020; Chen and He, 2021), which is capable of avoiding the collapsed solution without the help of negative instances.Inspired by bootstrapping methods in deep reinforcement learning (Mnihet al., 2015; Mnih et al., 2016), it directly bootstraps the representation of images by using two neural networks that iteratively learn from each other.This approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance for various downstream tasks in computer vision, and also shows better robustness to the choice of data augmentations used for self-supervision.

65,"How does the authors show utilizing augmented views of positive interactions can lead the performance improvement, especially in sparser datasets?","In Figure 4, our stochastic data augmentation (i.e., P>0) brings a significant improvement compared to the case of using the fixed neighborhood information (i.e., P=0) as encoder inputs.This result shows that the augmented views of positive interactions encourage BUIR to effectively learn users’ preference on items even in much sparse dataset.Interestingly, in case of the Ciao dataset which is less sparse than CiteULike, the benefit of our augmentation linearly increases with the maximum drop probability.This is because there is room for producing more various views (i.e., larger perturbation) based on a relatively more number of neighbors, and it eventually helps to boost the recommendation performance.To sum up, our framework that adopts the neighbor augmentation function successfully relieves the data sparsity issue of the OCCF problem, by leveraging the augmented views of few positive interactions. Our extensive evaluation on real-world implicit feedback datasets shows that BUIR consistently performs the best for top-K recommendation among a wide range of OCCF methods.In particular, the performance improvement becomes more significant in sparser datasets, with the help of utilizing augmented views of positive interactions as well as eliminating the effect of uncertain negative interactions.In addition, comparison results on a downstream task, which classifies the items into their category, support that BUIR learns more effective representations than other OCCF baselines.","They show augmented views of positive interactions can lead the performance improvement, especially in sparser datasets by showing the experimental result of stochastic data augmentation achieved a big improvement compared to the case of using the fixed neighborhood information as encoder inputs.","Most existing offline RL algorithms are not straightforward to apply to task-oriented dialogues because they suffer from the issue of diverging from human language, leading to poor dialogue strategies that do not resemble human language",0.0895522338605482,0.0,0.0895522338605482,1.176877973200725,24.50061180314141,19.705553113573693,0.0810185185185185,0.0088945362134688,0.1212648823857307,0.4592283921174943,0.1212648227810859,0.4044412970542907,0.0070114764086134,,0.7848729097636299,0.7711079988008458
66,Does utilizing the multi-hop neighbor information in meta-graph help improve the performance of the proposed model?,"Knowledge propagation via meta-graph.It is worth noting that, the above-defined knowledge injection process only leverages knowledge embeddings learned by TransE on the global graph \overline{\mathcal{G}}. Particularly, it lacks considering the knowledge that bridges the semantics between query and passage. To this end, we introduce a Graph Meta Network (GMN) module that refines knowledge with the constructed meta-graph \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}}, The multi-hop paths of \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}} allow the knowledge to be propagated between query and passage, which can enhance the relevance signal to be captured by the model, and thus alleviate the semantic gap. By applying a K-layer GMN in each layer of the knowledge injector, the output entity representation \hat{\mathbf{E}}_{e_{h}}^{(K)} can ensemble knowledge from all the K-hop neighbors. As described in Section 4.1.2 that all the paths of \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}} between \mathbf{q} and \mathbf{p} is within K hops, the GMN module can attentively propagate knowledge along the paths from entities in \mathbf{p} to those in \mathbf{q}, and vice versa, which can enrich the semantics of the entities that benefit the relevance modeling. Table 3 shows the performance comparisons between different settings of knowledge injector, which is statistically significant. From this table, we can observe the following phenomena. (1) MRR@10 of KERM without interaction and propagation process decreases at least 1\% respectively. This indicates both knowledge interaction and propagation processes play an indispensable role in ranking performance. (2) The performance of KERM without propagation is comparable to vanilla ERNIE. Not only query and passage entities, but also their multi-hop neighbors are essential for the ranking performance. (3) MRR@10 of KERM without knowledge interaction drops the most.

For knowledge aggregation, we design a novel interaction module between text and knowledge graph to combine the implicit and explicit knowledge. To derive implicit knowledge from text, we employ PLM as text encoder. To be aligned with implicit knowledge, knowledge meta graph is encoded with a multi-layer graph neural network (i.e. k-hop), namely Graph Meta Network (GMN). Each transformer layer outputs word representations. Each graph meta network layer outputs entity representations. Both word and entity representations are aggregated as the input of the following transformer and GMN layer, respectively in a novelly designed module, namely knowledge injector. Therefore through knowledge aggregation, implicit knowledge from text corpus and explicit knowledge from existing knowledge graph can mutually boost each other to achieve a better re-ranking performance, in which the issues in Challenge 2. could be mitigated. Overall, our contributions can be summarized as follows:•It is the first attempt to solve the knowledge enhanced PLMs problem for passage re-ranking.

The text and knowledge graph need to be refined with each other mutually in the interaction, which will be further analyzed in detail as follows. Knowledge graph distillation is performed in both global and local perspectives. To explore their roles in the ranking performance, we remove the graph pruning globally and sentence selection locally respectively, keep other settings unchanged, and derive KERM without graph pruning and sentence selection respectively. From results on TREC 2019 DL in Table 5, observations are listed as below. (1) Without global graph pruning, MRR@10 and the average edge score, calculated through Eq.(3), decrease the most, and the time efficiency drops slightly. This indicates the original knowledge graph exists noise data that affect performance.

69,Does the author showed that the distillation on the knowledge graph can be useful for re-ranking task?,"Existing knowledge graphs are usually incomplete and noisy. It is unsuitable for direct introduction of them to the current model. Specially, there is no knowledge base particularly for passage re-ranking task. For example, ConceptNet (Speeret al., 2017) is a general knowledge graph that contains common sense knowledge, where the information might not be useful for our passage re-ranking task. Therefore, it is critical for us to propose a knowledge graph distillation process from both global and local perspectives. Knowledge graph distillation is performed in both global and local perspectives. To explore their roles in the ranking performance, we remove the graph pruning globally and sentence selection locally respectively, keep other settings unchanged, and derive KERM without graph pruning and sentence selection respectively. From results on TREC 2019 DL in Table 5, observations are listed as below.

(2) Without sentence selection, the time efficiency drops the most and the average edge score decreases slightly, which proves that not every sentence in a passage has a positive effect on semantic matching. Overall, knowledge graph distillation is significant to KERM. The main goal of this paper is to reasonably introduce external knowledge graph to PLMs for passage re-ranking. We first design a novel knowledge meta graph construction method to distill reliable and query related knowledge from a general and noisy knowledge graph. The knowledge meta graph bridges the semantic gap between each query and passage. Then we propose a knowledge injector layer for mutually updating text and knowledge representations, which transformers word to entity representations for graph meta network, vice versa. Knowledge Enhanced Ranking Model is pretrained with Masked Language Model (MLM) Sentence Relation Prediction (SRP) [38] tasks, and fine-tuned with cross entropy loss function for passage re-ranking task. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art baselines without external knowledge due to its first attempt. The role of each module in KERM is also comprehensively analyzed. Since this work was limited to the one-to-one meta-graph of a query-passage pair built online, continued efforts are needed to make knowledge enhancement more efficient for both retrieval and re-ranking stage. Despite that the knowledge graph distillation in our method is empirically shown to be effective for the final performance, the implementation of graph pruning and meta-graph construction is still based on simple heuristics. A more promising way of formulating a useful meta-graph is to jointly learn a graph generator with the reranker in an end-to-end fashion, which enables more flexibility.Besides, it is currently infeasible to exploit the external knowledge in the retrieval stage, which needs to exhaustively build massive meta-graphs for a large scale of candidates. A further study could focus on how to use external knowledge in PLM based retriever. For knowledge graph distillation, we propose a novel pipeline to establish knowledge meta graphs, which only retain informative knowledge for passage re-ranking. Specifically, we first distill a graph globally for passage re-ranking scenario from an existing knowledge graph by pruning some unreliable or noisy relations based on TransE embedding. Then for a specific query-passage pair, we extract entities from both the query and passage, and construct a query-document bipartite entity graph based on query and passage entities and their k-hop neighbors, namely knowledge meta graph. Challenge 1. could be addressed in this distillation process.","This work proposes using knowledge graph distillation as it can help retain only informative knowledge needed for passage re-ranking. By investigating the effect of global and local distillation separately, this work found that the MRR@10 score and efficiency decreased slightly without global distillation, and that time efficiency decreased the most without local distillation. Therefore, this work demonstrates that both global and local distillation of knowledge graphs is useful for re-ranking tasks in terms of performance and efficiency.","Sure!

71,What methods refine the graph containing external knowledge in 1) global and 2) local way?,"For knowledge graph distillation, we propose a novel pipeline to establish knowledge meta graphs, which only retain informative knowledge for passage re-ranking. Specifically, we first distill a graph globally for passage re-ranking scenario from an existing knowledge graph by pruning some unreliable or noisy relations based on TransE embedding. Then for a specific query-passage pair, we extract entities from both the query and passage, and construct a query-document bipartite entity graph based on query and passage entities and their k-hop neighbors, namely knowledge meta graph. Challenge 1. could be addressed in this distillation process.","The knowledge graph is distilled globally by taking an existing knowledge graph and pruning unreliable or noise relations based on TransE embeddings. The graph is then distilled locally by extracting entities from both the given query and passage, and constructing a query-document bipartite entity graph based on the extracted entities and their k-hop neighbors.","CifarNet, AlexNet-ImNet, and GoogLeNet-RI-H",0.0465116262195782,0.0,0.0465116262195782,1.2743248999128778,6.231039383554278,7.0638551946580765,0.0192678227360308,0.0007541478129713,0.1693522632122039,0.0,0.1829575598239898,0.0,0.0010671946039473,0.0,0.832464955723838,0.7474018408856875
72,What is the example of unreliable relations in knowledge graph for passage re-ranking scenario?,"•Challenge 1. Existing knowledge graph are not constructed for re-ranking task. They usually contain trivial factual triples, which can hardly bring information gain. The inappropriate selection of external knowledge could even jeopardize the re-ranker performance. How to utilize existing knowledge graph to re-ranking task is remain a challenge.•Challenge 2.The explicit knowledge and implicit knowledge are highly heterogeneous due to the different sources, which makes the aggregation of the two difficult.How to mutually refine each other and effectively aggregate explicit knowledge into implicit knowledge to alleviate the semantic gap between query and passage is still a challenge. Fig. 2 shows a real case of our global graph pruning method on ConceptNet, i.e., a general knowledge graph. In this case, the entity hepatitis has various relations to disease, infectious disease, adult, etc. From the distance of nodes in Fig. 2, we can clearly observe that the knowledge hepatitis is an infectious disease is more reliable and informative than hepatitis is located at adult. To hepatitis, the concept adult is more general than infectious disease. This indicates that our pruning method can effectively eliminate less informative knowledge.","Unreliable relations in a knowledge graph involve trivial factual triplets that do not bring substantial information gain. For example, in ConceptNet, the entity “hepatitis” has relations with both “infectious disease” and “adult”. To the concept “hepatitis”,  the concept “adults” is more general than “infectious disease” and thus the relationship between “hepatitis” and “infectious disease” is more reliable and informative.","Using an existing word as an identifier can lead to a strong prior in the language model and diffusion model, causing the model to entangle the word's original meaning with the subject's appearance, resulting in decreased performance and training time",0.133333328440889,0.0,0.133333328440889,1.0364394271847823,24.64178610645165,21.708333440615323,0.0905562742561448,0.0073529411764705,0.211640328168869,0.4614954736174607,0.2580429315567016,0.2642886936664581,0.0063034419687455,0.0,0.7688372079518248,0.7865355705049066
73,"What does ""meta"" means in the term graph meta network (GMN)?","Knowledge propagation via meta-graph.It is worth noting that, the above-defined knowledge injection process only leverages knowledge embeddings learned by TransE on the global graph \overline{\mathcal{G}}. Particularly, it lacks considering the knowledge that bridges the semantics between query and passage. To this end, we introduce a Graph Meta Network (GMN) module that refines knowledge with the constructed meta-graph \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}}, The multi-hop paths of \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}} allow the knowledge to be propagated between query and passage, which can enhance the relevance signal to be captured by the model, and thus alleviate the semantic gap. For knowledge aggregation, we design a novel interaction module between text and knowledge graph to combine the implicit and explicit knowledge. To derive implicit knowledge from text, we employ PLM as text encoder. To be aligned with implicit knowledge, knowledge meta graph is encoded with a multi-layer graph neural network (i.e. k-hop), namely Graph Meta Network (GMN). Each transformer layer outputs word representations. Each graph meta network layer outputs entity representations. Both word and entity representations are aggregated as the input of the following transformer and GMN layer, respectively in a novelly designed module, namely knowledge injector. Therefore through knowledge aggregation, implicit knowledge from text corpus and explicit knowledge from existing knowledge graph can mutually boost each other to achieve a better re-ranking performance, in which the issues in Challenge 2. could be mitigated. Different from existing knowledge-enhanced PLMs for other NLP tasks, our aim for the re-ranking task is particularly on the relevance modeling between query and passage. Thus, we further leverage the knowledge in the global graph G to construct “bridges” between query and passage, which alleviates the semantic gap and improves semantic modeling. More specifically, for a given query-passage pair (i.e., (q, p)), we propose to construct a bipartite meta-graph that connects those entities in the q and those in p.",The Graph Meta Network (GMN) refines knowledge in a meta-graph. A meta-graph is a graph that is constructed by constructing multi-hop paths between the entities in a query and a passage using the knowledge from a global graph. The meaning for “meta” in both graph meta network (GMN) and meta-graph is not explicitly defined in this paper.,"Yes.

Given a query q, passage re-ranking aims at ordering a set of 𝜘 passages, i.e., P =  p𝜅 	𝜘 𝜅=1 , which is usually retrieved from a large-scale passage collection by a retriever, e.g. BM25 [48], DPR [16] etc. In particular, a passage is a sequence of words p = {𝑤𝑝 } |p| 𝑝=1 , where |p| is the length of passage p. Similarly, a query is a sequence of words q = {𝑤𝑞 } |q| 𝑞=1 .

78,What is the difference of RocketQAv1 and RocketQAv2 model?,"Existing PLMs based re-rankers typically improve ranking performance from two aspects: (1) By optimizing the ranking procedure: monoBERT (Nogueira and Cho, 2019) is the first work that re-purposed BERT as a passage re-ranker and achieves state-of-the-art results. duoBERT (Nogueiraet al., 2019a) integrates monoBERT in a multistage ranking architecture and adopts a pairwise classification approach to passage relevance computation. UED (Yanet al., 2021) proposes a cascade pre-training manner that can jointly enhance the retrieval stage through passage expansion with a pre-trained query generator and thus elevate the re-ranking stage with a pre-trained transformer encoder. The two stages can facilitate each other in a unified pre-training framework. H-ERNIE (Chuet al., 2022) proposes a multi-granularity PLM for web search.(2) By designing rational distillation procedure: LM Distill + Fine-Tuning (Gaoet al., 2020) explores a variety of distillation methods to equip a smaller re-ranker with both general-purpose language modeling knowledge learned in pre-training and search- specific relevance modeling knowledge learned in fine-tuning, and produces a faster re-ranker with better ranking performance. CAKD (Hofstätter et al., 2020) proposes a cross-architecture knowledge distillation procedure with a Margin-MSE loss, which can distill knowledge from multiple teachers at the same time. RocketQAv1 (Qu et al., 2021) trains dual-encoder and cross-encoder in a cascade manner, which leverages the powerful cross-encoder to empower the dual-encoder. RocketQAv2 (Ren et al., 2021) proposes a novel approach that jointly trains the dense passage retriever and passage re-ranker. The parameters of RocketQAv2 are inherited from RocketQAv1. Besides, RocketQAv2 utilizes a large PLM for data augmentation and denoising, which can also be regarded as a distillation procedure. Notably, these two types of studies anticipate more insightful information to be captured by the advanced ranking and training procedures, while neglecting the limitations of implicit knowledge extracted from noisy and heterogeneous data. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed the first knowledge-enhanced PLM based re-ranker, which thoughtfully leverages explicit external knowledge that improve the effectiveness of the model. We include several PLMs based re-rankers in our evaluation, including the state-of-the-art:•monoBERT (Nogueira and Cho, 2019): The first study that re-purposes BERT as a re-ranker and achieves state-of-the-art results.•duoBERT (Nogueiraet al., 2019a):This work proposes a pairwise classification approach using BERT, which obtains the ability to be more sensitive to semantics through greater computation.•UED (Yanet al., 2021): A unified pre-training framework that jointly refines re-ranker and query generator. For a fair comparison, we only use the re-ranker in UED without passage expansion.•LM Distill+Fine-Tuning (LDFT) (Gaoet al., 2020):A variety of distillation methods are compared in this paper. The experimental results indicate that a proper distillation procedure (i.e. first distill the language model, and then fine-tune on the ranking task) could produce a faster re-ranker with better ranking performance.•CAKD (Hofstätter et al., 2020): This work proposes a cross-architecture knowledge distillation procedure with Margin-MSE loss, which can distill knowledge from multiple teachers.•RocketQAv1 (Qu et al., 2021): This work mainly focuses on the training of PLM based retriever, where the re-ranker is an intermediate product of its training process.•RocketQAv2 (Ren et al., 2021): Based on RocketQAv1, this work proposes a novel approach that jointly trains the PLM based retriever and re-ranker.To compare the performance of different methods, we resort to two ranking metrics.For MSMARCO-DEV, We adopt Mean Reciprocal Rank (i.e., MRR@10).For TREC 2019 DL, we use Mean Average Precision, i.e., MAP@10 and MAP@30.For Ohsumed, both Mean Reciprocal Rank and Mean Average Precision (i.e., MRR@10 and MAP@10) are employed for comprehensive performance analysis in queries requiring in-depth domain knowledge.","RocketQAv1 trains dual-encoder and cross-encoder in a cascade manner, which leverages the powerful cross-encoder to empower the dual-encoder.

79,Would the performance be improved if the PLM model is pre-trained or fine-tuned on bio-medical domain datasets?,"However, implicit knowledge still has some inherent weaknesses, which limits the applicability of PLMs based re-rankers. First,queries and passages are usually created by different persons and have different expression ways (Nogueiraet al., 2019b), such as word usage and language style.Worse still, the data distributions of search queries and web contents are highly heterogeneous (Liuet al., 2021), where various specialized domains (e.g., bio-medical) may only have few training examples in a general corpus. Domain-specific knowledge can hardly be revealed and captured by the model, and thus the processing of domain-specific queries is often inaccurate. Results are obtained from Table 6. (1) Poor ranking performances of all models on bio-medical domain indicates that it is more challenging in the data scarcity scenario, where textual data is not covered widely in the PLMs’ pretraining datasets. (2) Compared with ERNIE, KERM has a higher relative improvement in bio-medical domain than general domain. This demonstrates that the incorporation of knowledge graph is more useful for a data scarcity domain. To verify this idea, we compare the size of knowledge meta graph used for different domains as follows.","In their experiments, the authors showed that all of the models performed poorly on the bio-medical domain due to the textual data of the domain not being covered widely in the PLMs’ pretraining dataset. This lack of data can cause the PLM to struggle to reveal and capture knowledge specific to that domain. These results suggest that further training on bio-medical data could increase performance.","By annealing the value of beta and decreasing the KL regularization during training, the decoder is able to make greater use of z because the model is no longer penalized as heavily for deviating from the prior distribution.

80,What characteristics of large-scale pre-trained language models made it remarkable successful for passage re-ranking task?,"Passage Re-ranking is a crucial stage in modern information retrieval systems, which aims to reorder a small set of candidate passages to be presented to users. To put the most relevant passages on top of a ranking list, a re-ranker is usually designed with powerful capacity in modeling semantic relevance, which attracted a wealth of research studies in the past decade (Guo et al., 2020). Recently,large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), e.g. BERT (Devlinet al., 2018), ERNIE (Sun et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), have dominated many natural language processing tasks, and have also achieved remarkable success on passage re-ranking.For example, PLM based re-rankers (MacAvaney et al., 2019; Liet al., 2020; Dong and Niu, 2021; Donget al., 2022) have achieved state-of-the-art performance, which takes the concatenation of query-passage pair as input, and applies multi-layer full-attention to model their semantic relevance. Their superiority can be attributed to the expressive transformer structure and the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm, which allow the model to learn useful implicit knowledge (i.e., semantic relevance in the latent space) from massive textual corpus (Fan et al., 2021).",Large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been found to be successful for passage re-ranking due to their ability to learn semantic relevance in the latent space from massive textual corpus. PLMs obtain this ability from their expressive transformer architecture and the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm.,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The approach does not simply add all feedback examples in memory to the prompt because it would not be effective and would not scale beyond the 2048 tokens limit. While adding all feedback examples to the prompt may seem like a straightforward solution, it would result in a large and unwieldy prompt that would be difficult to process and would exceed the maximum token limit.

81,How does the knowledge distilation works if meta-graph can't be constructed (i.e. there is no corresponding entities in knowledge graph for query/passage)?,"(1)Key sentence selection. The actual information need of a user usually concentrates on a small part of a relevant passage (Guo et al., 2020). To this end, we mimic human judgment and only focus on the sentence of each passage that is the most related to a query (Zou et al., 2021).In particular, we define the relevance score between a query q and a sentence \textbf{s}_{i} as(7)Rel_{qs}(\textbf{q},\textbf{s}_{i})=\frac{\sum_{q=1}^{|\textbf{q}|}\textbf{E}(w_{q})}{|\textbf{q}|}\cdot\frac{\sum_{s=1}^{|\textbf{s}_{i}|}\textbf{E}(w_{s})}{|\textbf{s}_{i}|}.For the sake of efficiency, we initialize \textbf{E}(w) from Word2Vec (Mikolovet al., 2013) embedding.Based on Eq.(7), we select the most relevant sentence \textbf{s}^{*} in p to build the meta-graph for \mathbf{q} and \mathbf{p}.(2)Target entity recognition.Next, we select the entities in q and \textbf{s}^{*} to construct the meta-graph. Specifically, we only consider the entities that exactly match in \mathcal{E}. Meanwhile, we omit those entity phrases that are sub-sequences of other recognized entities.For example, in the query ""what causes low liver enzymes"", both ""liver"" and ""liver enzyme"" are entities, but the entity ""liver enzyme"" is more informative to be recognized as the target entity, and ""liver"" should be omitted.(3)Path discovery. Finally, given the target entities of q and \textbf{s}^{*} (denoted as \phi_{\mathbf{q}} and \phi_{\mathbf{s}^{*}}, respectively), we perform Breadth First Search (BFS) on \overline{\mathcal{G}} to discover the paths within K-hop between \phi_{\mathbf{q}} and \phi_{\mathbf{s}^{*}}. Note that we only keep the within-K-hop paths that might be the most useful for the downstream re-ranking task. Meanwhile, the knowledge could be complemented from the K-hop paths.","Entities that exactly match entities in E are selected from q and s* to construct the meta-graph. Also, entities that are sub-sequences of other recognized entities are omitted. This process assumes that entities are identified in the query and passage.

82,Does this method likely to show similar tendency of performance improvement when other backbone model (like BERT_large) is used?,"We use the traditional sparse retriever BM25 (Yanget al., 2017) as our first stage method. All experiments are conducted under the same BM25 setting with 1000 retrieved candidates. We conduct experiments with the deep learning framework PaddlePaddle (Maet al., 2019) on up to 4 NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPUs (with 40G RAM). For the GMN module, we use Paddle Graph Learning (PGL) 222https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PGL, an efficient and flexible graph learning framework based on PaddlePaddle. For training, we used the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 1e-5 for text encoder and 1e-4 for knowledge injector. The model is trained up to 5 epochs with a batch size of 640 and 240 for base and large models respectively.In our experiments, the PLM small, base and large models have 6, 12 and 24 Transformer layers respectively.The text encoder has 9 layers and 21 layers for base and large model respectively, and the knowledge injector both has 3 layers in our experiment. The dropout rates are set to 0.1. The ratio of the positive to the hard negative is set to 1:19.All transformer layers in KERM’s backbone are initialized from ERNIE-2.0 base (Sunet al., 2020b), which is a BERT-like model pre-trained with a continual pre-training framework on multiple tasks. We perform Knowledge-enhanced pre-training on MARCO passage collection to warm up the parameters in knowledge injector, which has 60,000 iterations under the batch size of 256.For a fair comparison, the same pre-training without knowledge enhancement is also conducted on \textrm{ERNIE}_{\textrm{base}} re-ranker and all models in ablation studies. (4) Compared with \textrm{ERNIE}_{\textrm{base}} we trained, \textrm{KERM}_{\textrm{base}} shows a significant improvement on both two query sets. This indicates the explicit introduction of external knowledge can alleviate the semantic gap and heterogeneity between query and passage, and improve the semantic matching performance.","Through the experiments, this work demonstrated that the KERM model was able to significantly improve on the performance of its backbone model, ERNIE. The authors posit that this is due to how KERM explicitly introduces external knowledge which can improve semantic matching performance. This suggests that KERM models with other backbone models will be able to improve on the performance of their backbone models. However, the likelihood of performance improvements with other backbone models cannot be answered from this paper.",Using graph structures explicitly means incorporating information about the topological structure of the graph into the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer architecture,0.0895522350189353,0.0,0.0895522350189353,0.6726676431024142,24.951871108199445,21.26449940923648,0.042997542997543,0.0028863815271582,0.2269775122404098,0.540617961295881,0.1925478875637054,0.3409306108951568,0.0053596169958472,,0.7555572799932694,0.7778227220143391
83,Why does existing knowledge enhanced PLMs (such as CokeBERT and CoLake) cannot be used directly for re-ranking tasks?,"Existing KE-PLMs can be categorized by the granularity of knowledge they incorporate from knowledge graph (KG), as text-based knowledge, entity knowledge and KG meta-graphs.To integrate text-based knowledge, RAG (Lewiset al., 2020) and KIF (Fanet al., 2020) first retrieve top-k documents from Wikipedia using KNN-based retrieval, and the PLM model is employed to generate the output conditioned on these retrieved documents. Entity-level information can be highly useful for a variety of natural language understanding tasks. Hence, many existing KE-PLMs target this type of simple yet powerful knowledge. ERNIE(BAIDU) (Sun et al., 2019) introduces a new pre-training strategy of language model which masking phrases or entities in order to implicitly learn both synaptic and semantic knowledge from these units. ERNIE(THU) (Zhanget al., 2019) integrates informative entity representations in the knowledge module into the underlying layers of the semantic module based on the alignments between text and entity to equip the model with the ability of knowledge awareness. As knowledge graphs provide richer information than simply entity, more and more researchers start to explore integration of more sophisticated knowledge, such as meta-graphs in KG. CokeBERT (Su et al., 2021) proposes a novel semantic-driven Graph Neural Network (GNN) to dynamically select contextual knowledge and embed knowledge context according to textual context for PLMs, which can avoid the effect of redundant and ambiguous knowledge in KGs that cannot match the input text.CoLake (Sunet al., 2020a) also uses GNN to aggregate information from the constructed meta-graph in both pre-training and inference. CoLake converts the meta-graph into token sequence and appends it to input sequence for PLMs, which is distinctive to CokeBERT. Although extensive research has been proposed up to now to address the knowledge-aware problem, none exists which constrained on how to use knowledge to empower PLMs particularly for re-ranking tasks. Different from existing knowledge-enhanced PLMs for other NLP tasks, our aim for the re-ranking task is particularly on the relevance modeling between query and passage.Thus, we further leverage the knowledge in the global graph \overline{\mathcal{G}} to construct “bridges” between query and passage, which alleviates the semantic gap and improves semantic modeling.More specifically, for a given query-passage pair (i.e., (\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})), we propose to construct a bipartite meta-graph that connects those entities in the \mathbf{q} and those in \mathbf{p}.","While approaches like CokeBERT and CoLake integrate sophisticated knowledge into PLMs through knowledge graphs, they did not focus specifically on using knowledge to empower PLMs for re-ranking tasks.

84,Would there be a performance gain if the model utilizes the IE (information extraction) model instead of the exact match for target entity recognition?,"(1)Key sentence selection.

Note that we only keep the within-K-hop paths that might be the most useful for the downstream re-ranking task. Meanwhile, the knowledge could be complemented from the K-hop paths. • Challenge 1. Existing knowledge graph are not constructed for re-ranking task. They usually contain trivial factual triples, which can hardly bring information gain. The inappropriate selection of external knowledge could even jeopardize the re-ranker performance. How to utilize existing knowledge graph to re-ranking task is remain a challenge. • Challenge 2. The explicit knowledge and implicit knowledge are highly heterogeneous due to the different sources, which makes the aggregation of the two difficult. How to mutually refine each other and effectively aggregate explicit knowledge into implicit knowledge to alleviate the semantic gap between query and passage is still a challenge.","This work’s approach aims at focusing mostly on informative factors. For example, the key sentence selection module focused on extracting only the most relevant sentences and the target entity recognition module focused on identifying only the most informative entities. Further, this work argues that, to use knowledge graphs for re-ranking tasks, it is important that the graphs contain triplets with substantial information gain.

85,How does TransE learns entity and relatio embeddings in unsupervised way?,"Given a global knowledge graph \mathcal{G}, the first step is to eliminate those knowledge that might be noisy to be applied. To achieve this, we use TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) to measure the reliability of a given knowledge triplet. In particular, TransE is an unsupervised learning method that learns latent representations for a knowledge triplet (e_{h},r,e_{t}). Intuitively, it models the latent distribution of knowledge in a given knowledge graph, and those who are out of this distribution can be viewed as less informative knowledge, which should not be used. Based on this,we use the entity embeddings pre-trained by TransE to calculate a distance metric between two linked entities as(3)Rel_{e}(e_{h},r,e_{t})=\mathbf{E}({e_{h}})\cdot\mathbf{E}(r)+\mathbf{E}({e_{h}})\cdot\mathbf{E}({e_{t}})+\mathbf{E}({r})\cdot\mathbf{E}({e_{t}}),(4)Dist(e_{h},e_{t})=\frac{1}{Rel_{e}(e_{h},r,e_{t})},where \mathbf{E}({e}) and \mathbf{E}({r}) are the TransE embeddings of entity and relation, respectively, and the inner product measures the relevance between two vectors. As the objective of TranE is aligned with minimizing the distance shown in Eq.(4), we can consider those knowledge triplets with small distance values as informative knowledge.",TransE is an unsupervised learning method that learns latent representations for a knowledge triplet.

90,What is an example of model compression approaches?,"The overarching goal of our work is to identify a model that has very few parameters while preserving accuracy.To address this problem, a sensible approach is to take an existing CNN model and compress it in a lossy fashion.In fact, a research community has emerged around the topic of model compression, and several approaches have been reported.A fairly straightforward approach by Denton et al. is to apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to a pretrained CNN model Denton et al. (2014).Han et al. developed Network Pruning, which begins with a pretrained model, then replaces parameters that are below a certain threshold with zeros to form a sparse matrix, and finally performs a few iterations of training on the sparse CNN Han et al. (2015b).Recently, Han et al. extended their work by combining Network Pruning with quantization (to 8 bits or less) and huffman encoding to create an approach called Deep Compression Han et al. (2015a), and further designed a hardware accelerator called EIE Han et al. (2016a) that operates directly on the compressed model, achieving substantial speedups and energy savings.","different examples can be: Applying SVD to a pretrained CNN model through which we can obtain most effective parameters or features of largest singular values of this factorization if we want.

Also Network Pruning, which begins with a pretrained model, then replaces parameters that are below a certain threshold with zeros to form a sparse matrix, and finally performs a few iterations of training on the sparse CNN Maybe seen as another example .

92,What is an example of a DSE approach?,"Neural networks (including deep and convolutional NNs) have a large design space, with numerous options for microarchitectures, macroarchitectures, solvers, and other hyperparameters.It seems natural that the community would want to gain intuition about how these factors impact a NN’s accuracy (i.e. the shape of the design space).Much of the work on design space exploration (DSE) of NNs has focused on developing automated approaches for finding NN architectures that deliver higher accuracy.These automated DSE approaches include bayesian optimization Snoek et al. (2012), simulated annealing Ludermir et al. (2006), randomized search Bergstra & Bengio (2012), and genetic algorithms Stanley & Miikkulainen (2002).To their credit, each of these papers provides a case in which the proposed DSE approach produces a NN architecture that achieves higher accuracy compared to a representative baseline.However, these papers make no attempt to provide intuition about the shape of the NN design space.Later in this paper, we eschew automated approaches – instead, we refactor CNNs in such a way that we can do principled A/B comparisons to investigate how CNN architectural decisions influence model size and accuracy.","An example of DSE approach can be  Bayesian optimization, simulated annealing, randomized search or genetic algorithms and all tend to develop automated approaches to find NN architectures exhibiting higher accuracy.","Sure!

94,"How does the choice of layers, in which to downsample, affect the size of activation maps?","Strategy 3. Downsample late in the network so that convolution layers have large activation maps.In a convolutional network, each convolution layer produces an output activation map with a spatial resolution that is at least 1x1 and often much larger than 1x1.The height and width of these activation maps are controlled by: (1) the size of the input data (e.g. 256x256 images) and (2) the choice of layers in which to downsample in the CNN architecture.Most commonly, downsampling is engineered into CNN architectures by setting the (stride > 1) in some of the convolution or pooling layers (e.g. Szegedy et al. (2014); Simonyan & Zisserman (2014); Krizhevsky et al. (2012)).If early333In our terminology, an “early” layer is close to the input data. layers in the network have large strides, then most layers will have small activation maps.Conversely, if most layers in the network have a stride of 1, and the strides greater than 1 are concentrated toward the end444In our terminology, the “end” of the network is the classifier. of the network, then many layers in the network will have large activation maps.Our intuition is that large activation maps (due to delayed downsampling) can lead to higher classification accuracy, with all else held equal.Indeed, K. He and H. Sun applied delayed downsampling to four different CNN architectures, and in each case delayed downsampling led to higher classification accuracy He & Sun (2015).","As we can see, downsampling aim to collect summary about statistics of different regions of some feature map, and this can be addressed with stride >1 in convolution or pooling layers which affects the size of activation map. If early layers  have large strides, then most layers will have small activation maps and if most layers in the network have a stride of 1, and the strides greater than 1 are later in the network, then many layers in the network will have large activation maps.","To save space and focus on the main results, the standard deviation is not shown in the table",0.0821917773991369,0.0212765927818021,0.0821917773991369,1.0061328072545273,19.26864950358916,17.038755946510832,0.0615065028901734,0.0022449488650536,0.0193669684231281,0.5052320167075757,0.0473213344812393,0.4001007378101349,0.0148254419641124,,0.7092852550305073,0.7263553644791578

(2015a) to SqueezeNet, using 33% sparsity666Note that, due to the storage overhead of storing sparse matrix indices, 33% sparsity leads to somewhat less than a 3×3\times3 × decrease in model size. and 8-bit quantization.This yields a 0.66 MB model (363×363\times363 × smaller than 32-bit AlexNet) with equivalent accuracy to AlexNet.Further, applying Deep Compression with 6-bit quantization and 33% sparsity on SqueezeNet, we produce a 0.47MB model (510×510\times510 × smaller than 32-bit AlexNet) with equivalent accuracy.Our small model is indeed amenable to compression.",size after taking these considerations would be a 0.66 MB model 363× smaller than 32-bit AlexNet with equivalent accuracy to AlexNet.,"By substituting the update steps in lines 10 and 11 of Algorithm 2 with the corresponding updates for any \ell_{p} norm, and using Holder's inequality to obtain a lower bound on the \ell_{p} norm of the perturbation",0.1153846105695268,0.0,0.1153846105695268,0.761720379235356,16.25173323303104,13.221057444075685,0.0617283950617284,0.0101732196865548,0.1251420676708221,0.389049397690313,0.1251420378684997,0.5215989351272583,0.0062452510674518,0.0,0.8068067318499406,0.7391302979280726
101,"To investigate the effect of the squeeze ratio on model size and accuracy, were the models fine-tuned or trained from scratch?","In these experiments, we use SqueezeNet (Figure 2) as a starting point.As in SqueezeNet, these experiments use the following metaparameters: base_{e}=128, incr_{e}=128, pct_{3x3}=0.5, and freq=2.We train multiple models, where each model has a different squeeze ratio (SR)777Note that, for a given model, all Fire layers share the same squeeze ratio. in the range [0.125, 1.0].In Figure 3(a), we show the results of this experiment, where each point on the graph is an independent model that was trained from scratch.SqueezeNet is the SR=0.125 point in this figure.888Note that we named it SqueezeNet because it has a low squeeze ratio (SR).

We can see the answer in simple bypass (wire) as it resemble residual connections which help in keeping considerable gradient values needed for precise learning specially while going deeper. Also, complex bypass adds more parameters which increases the number of parameters trained for the same task on the same data(it may have some small overfitting side effect ).","Yes, there are problems with using web crawl data.

One of the main issues is that web crawl data can contain non-English text, which can be difficult to accurately classify and remove.

105,The goal of authors regarding microarchitectural design space was to understand the impact of CNN architectural choices on model size and accuracy. Were they able to draw a conclusive impact?,"As you can see, there are several advantages of smaller CNN architectures.With this in mind, we focus directly on the problem of identifying a CNN architecture with fewer parameters but equivalent accuracy compared to a well-known model.We have discovered such an architecture, which we call SqueezeNet.In addition, we present our attempt at a more disciplined approach to searching the design space for novel CNN architectures. In this section, we design and execute experiments with the goal of providing intuition about the shape of the microarchitectural design space with respect to the design strategies that we proposed in Section 3.1.Note that our goal here is not to maximize accuracy in every experiment, but rather to understand the impact of CNN architectural choices on model size and accuracy.","They come to an impact that the size of the model can be reduced while still obtaining same or higher accuracy with fewer parameters through manipulating architectural design strategies as is the case in their architecture -SqueezeNet.

We take a one hidden layer unconditionedComposite Model trained on moving MNIST digits. The model has 2048 LSTM unitsand looks at a 64 \times 64 input. It was trained on input sequences of 10frames to reconstruct those 10 frames as well as predict 10 frames into thefuture. In order to test if the future predictor is able to generalize beyond 10frames, we let the model run for 100 steps into the future.Fig. 7(a) shows the pattern of activity in the LSTM units of thefuture predictorpathway for a randomly chosen test input. It shows the activity at each of thethree sigmoidal gates (input, forget, output), the input (after the tanhnon-linearity, before being multiplied by the input gate), the cell state andthe final output (after being multiplied by the output gate). Even though theunits are ordered randomly along the vertical axis, we can see that the dynamicshas a periodic quality to it. The model is able to generate persistent motionfor long periods of time. In terms of reconstruction, the model only outputsblobs after the first 15 frames, but the motion is relatively well preserved.More results, including long range future predictions over hundreds of time steps can see been athttp://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nitish/unsupervised_video.To show that setting up a periodic behaviour is not trivial,Fig. 7(b) shows the activity from a randomly initialized futurepredictor. Here, the LSTM state quickly converges and the outputs blur completely. Experiments on MNIST; We first trained our models on a dataset of moving MNIST digits. In this dataset, each video was 20 frames long and consisted of two digits moving inside a 64 × 64 patch. The digits were chosen randomly from the training set and placed initially at random locations inside the patch. Experiments on Natural Image Patches; Next, we tried to see if our models can also work with natural image patches. For this, we trained the models on sequences of 32 × 32 natural image patches extracted from the UCF-101 dataset. In this case, we used linear output units and the squared error loss function. Out-of-domain Inputs; Next, we test this model’s ability to deal with out-of domain inputs. For this, we test the model on sequences of one and three moving digits. The model was trained on sequences of two moving digits, so it has never seen inputs with just one digit or three digits. Visualizing Features; Next, we visualize the features learned by this model. Fig. 9 shows the weights that connect each input frame to the encoder LSTM. There are four sets of weights. One set of weights connects the frame to the input units. There are three other sets, one corresponding to each of the three gates (input, forget and output).

122,Which variants of LSTM encoder-decoder models are used in this study?,"Another natural unsupervised learning task for sequences is predicting thefuture. This is the approach used in language models for modeling sequences ofwords. The design of the Future Predictor Model is same as that of theAutoencoder Model, except that the decoder LSTM in this case predicts frames ofthe video that come after the input sequence (Fig. 3).Ranzato et al. (2014) use a similar model but predict only the next frame at eachtime step. This model, on the other hand, predicts a long sequence into thefuture. Here again we can consider two variants of the decoder – conditionaland unconditioned. For each of these two models, we can consider two possibilities - one in whichthe decoder LSTM is conditioned on the last generated frame and the other inwhich it is not. In the experimental section, we explore these choicesquantitatively. Here we briefly discuss arguments for and against a conditionaldecoder. A strong argument in favour of using a conditional decoder is that itallows the decoder to model multiple modes in the target sequence distribution.Without that, we would end up averaging the multiple modes in the low-levelinput space. However, this is an issue only if we expect multiple modes in thetarget sequence distribution. For the LSTM Autoencoder, there is only onecorrect target and hence a unimodal target distribution. But for the LSTM FuturePredictor there is a possibility of multiple targets given an input because evenif we assume a deterministic universe, everything needed to predict the futurewill not necessarily be observed in the input. Future prediction results are summarized in Table 2. For MNIST we compute the cross entropy of the predictions with respect to the ground truth, both of which are 64 × 64 patches. For natural image patches, we compute the squared loss. We see that the Composite Model always does a better job of predicting the future compared to the Future Predictor. This indicates that having the autoencoder along with the future predictor to force the model to remember more about the inputs actually helps predict the future better. Next, we can compare each model with its conditional variant. Here, we find that the conditional models perform better, as was also noted in Fig. 5.","Future Predictor, Composite Model, Conditional Future Predictor, Composite Model with Conditional Future Predictor are the variants of LSTM encoder-decoder models are used in this study.",The author used random corruption of either the subject or object of each positive example to create negative samples for the decoder module in the link prediction task,0.1818181769111571,0.0,0.1363636314566117,1.8196871111910016,27.27832474502872,22.23488229296926,0.0692041522491349,0.0102639296187683,0.36287721991539,0.478873828282723,0.3628773093223572,0.1306375116109848,0.0040192394023166,,0.8056244132579263,0.8013091178245093

127,Why the authors prefer to learn video representations through unsupervised models?,"Supervised learning has been extremely successful in learning good visualrepresentations that not only produce good results at the task they are trainedfor, but also transfer well to other tasks and datasets. Therefore, it isnatural to extend the same approach to learning video representations. This hasled to research in 3D convolutional nets (Ji et al., 2013; Tran et al., 2014), different temporalfusion strategies (Karpathy et al., 2014) and exploring different ways ofpresenting visual information to convolutional nets (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014a).However, videos are much higher dimensional entities compared to single images.Therefore, it becomes increasingly difficult to do credit assignment and learn longrange structure, unless we collect much more labelled data or do a lot offeature engineering (for example computing the right kinds of flow features) tokeep the dimensionality low. The costly work of collecting more labelled dataand the tedious work of doing more clever engineering can go a long way insolving particular problems, but this is ultimately unsatisfying as a machinelearning solution. This highlights the need for using unsupervised learning tofind and represent structure in videos. Moreover, videos have a lot ofstructure in them (spatial and temporal regularities) which makes themparticularly well suited as a domain for building unsupervised learning models.",Labelling videos is a tedious job and that makes supervise training very expensive.

The model consists of two RNNs –the encoder LSTM and the decoder LSTM as shown in Fig. 2. Theinput to the model is a sequence of vectors (image patches or features). Theencoder LSTM reads in this sequence. After the last input has been read, thedecoder LSTM takes over and outputs a prediction for the target sequence. Thetarget sequence is same as the input sequence, but in reverse order. Reversingthe target sequence makes the optimization easier because the model can get offthe ground by looking at low range correlations. This is also inspired by howlists are represented in LISP. The encoder can be seen as creating a list byapplying the cons function on the previously constructed list and the newinput. The decoder essentially unrolls this list, with the hidden to outputweights extracting the element at the top of the list (car function) andthe hidden to hidden weights extracting the rest of the list (cdrfunction). Therefore, the first element out is the last element in. When designing any unsupervised learning model, it is crucial to have the rightinductive biases and choose the right objective function so that the learningsignal points the model towards learning useful features. Inthis paper, we use the LSTM Encoder-Decoder framework to learn videorepresentations. The key inductive bias here is that the same operation must beapplied at each time step to propagate information to the next step. Thisenforces the fact that the physics of the world remains the same, irrespective ofinput. The same physics acting on any state, at any time, must produce the nextstate. Our model works as follows.The Encoder LSTM runs through a sequence of frames to come upwith a representation. This representation is then decoded through another LSTMto produce a target sequence. We consider different choices of the targetsequence. One choice is to predict the same sequence as the input. Themotivation is similar to that of autoencoders – we wish to capture all that isneeded to reproduce the input but at the same time go through the inductivebiases imposed by the model. Another option is to predict the future frames.Here the motivation is to learn a representation that extracts all that isneeded to extrapolate the motion and appearance beyond what has been observed. These twonatural choices can also be combined. In this case, there are two decoder LSTMs– one that decodes the representation into the input sequence and another thatdecodes the same representation to predict the future.","From P0 and P1, It is directly answered that, through encoder-decoder the target sequence is produced.","Sure! Here's the answer to the question based on the provided context:

It was trained on input sequences of 10frames to reconstruct those 10 frames as well as predict 10 frames into thefuture. In order to test if the future predictor is able to generalize beyond 10frames, we let the model run for 100 steps into the future.Fig. 7(a) shows the pattern of activity in the LSTM units of thefuture predictorpathway for a randomly chosen test input.

135,Why the conditional decoder is difficult to optimize?,"There is also an argument against using a conditional decoder from theoptimization point-of-view. There are strong short-range correlations invideo data, for example, most of the content of a frame is same as the previousone. If the decoder was given access to the last few frames while generating aparticular frame at training time, it would find it easy to pick up on thesecorrelations. There would only be a very small gradient that tries to fix up theextremely subtle errors that require long term knowledge about the inputsequence. In an unconditioned decoder, this input is removed and the model isforced to look for information deep inside the encoder.","Since in conditional decoder have access to last few frames, often it find a easy way to pick up a correlated frame but not necessary an optimized one.

A strong argument in favour of using a conditional decoder is that itallows the decoder to model multiple modes in the target sequence distribution.Without that, we would end up averaging the multiple modes in the low-levelinput space. However, this is an issue only if we expect multiple modes in thetarget sequence distribution. For the LSTM Autoencoder, there is only onecorrect target and hence a unimodal target distribution.

140,Does the features learned by unsupervised learning improved the performance of supervised learning tasks?,"Fig. 12 compares three models - single frame classifier(logistic regression), baseline LSTM classifier and the LSTM classifierinitialized with weights from the Composite Model as the number of labelledvideos per class is varied. Note that having one labelled video means havingmany labelled 16 frame blocks. We can see that for the case of very fewtraining examples, unsupervised learning gives a substantial improvement. Forexample, for UCF-101, the performance improves from 29.6% to 34.3% whentraining on only one labelled video. As the size of the labelled dataset grows,the improvement becomes smaller. Even for the full UCF-101 dataset we still get aconsiderable improvement from 74.5% to 75.8%. On HMDB-51, the improvement isfrom 42.8% to 44.0% for the full dataset (70 videos per class) and 14.4% to19.1% for one video per class. Although, the improvement in classification byusing unsupervised learning was not as big as we expected, we still managed toyield an additional improvement over a strong baseline. We discuss some avenuesfor improvements later. Next, we compare the models using performance on a supervised task.Table 3 shows the performance on actionrecognition achieved by finetuning different unsupervised learning models.Besides running the experiments on the full UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, we also ran theexperiments on small subsets of these to better highlight the case where we havevery few training examples. We find that all unsupervised models improve over thebaseline LSTM which is itself well-regularized by using dropout. The Autoencodermodel seems to perform consistently better than the Future Predictor. TheComposite model which combines the two does better than either one alone.Conditioning on the generated inputs does not seem to give a clearadvantage over not doing so. The Composite Model with a conditional futurepredictor works the best, although its performance is almost same as that of theComposite Model. We proposed models based on LSTMs that can learn good video representations. Wecompared them and analyzed their properties through visualizations. Moreover, wemanaged to get an improvement on supervised tasks. The best performing model wasthe Composite Model that combined an autoencoder and a future predictor.Conditioning on generated outputs did not have a significant impact on theperformance for supervised tasks, however it made the future predictions lookslightly better. The model was able to persistently generate motion well beyondthe time scales it was trained for. However, it lost the precise object featuresrapidly after the training time scale. The features at the input and outputlayers were found to have some interesting properties.

145,What is kernel size used in each layer of SegNet?,"We draw inspiration of our encoder-decoder type architectures from probabilistic auto-encoders used to build generative models [24] and unsupervised learning of feature hierarchies [27]. Our main contribution is to learn an encoder-decoder stack trained in a modular and fully supervised manner for pixel-wise labelling. The addition of each deeper encoder-decoder pair results in an increased spatial context i.e., a 4 layer SegNet with 7\times 7 kernels and 2\times 2 non-overlapping max pooling in each layer has a spatial context of 106\times 106 pixels when a feature-map is backtracked to the input image. The SegNet predictions get smoother as more layers are added and demonstrate high accuracy, comparable to or even exceeding methods which use CRFs [36]. SegNet maintains a constant number of features per layer which is typically set to 64. This has a practical advantage that the computational cost successively decreases for each additional/deeper encoder-decoder pair. SegNet uses a “flat” architecture, i.e, the number of features in each layer remains the same (64 in our case) but with full connectivity. This choice is motivated by two reasons. First, it avoids parameter explosion, unlike an expanding deep encoder network with full feature connectivity (same for decoder). Second, the training time remains the same (in our experiments it slightly decreases) for each additional/deeper encoder-decoder pair as the feature map resolution is smaller which makes convolutions faster. Note that the decoder corresponding to the first encoder (closest to the input image) produces a multi-channel feature map although the encoder input is either 3 or 4 channels (RGB or RGBD) (see Fig. 1). This high dimensional feature representation is fed to the soft-max classifier. This is unlike the other decoders which produce feature maps the same size as their encoder inputs. A fixed pooling window of 2\times 2 with a stride of non-overlapping 2 pixels is used. This small size preserves thin structures in the scene. Further, a constant kernel size of 7\times 7 over all the layers was chosen to provide a wide context for smooth labelling i.e. a pixel in the deepest layer feature map can be traced back to a context window in the input image of 106\times 106 pixels. The trade-off here is between the size of the context window and retaining thin structures. Smaller kernels decrease context and larger ones potentially destroy thin structures.",The kernel size used in each layer of SegNet is 7*7.,"The authors chose to train YOLO using VGG-16 because it is a more accurate model, but also significantly slower than YOLO.

149,Can we use image classification models for semantic segmentation?,"Semantic pixel-wise segmentation is an ongoing topic of research, fuelled by challenging datasets [1, 33, 9]. Current best performing methods all mostly rely on hand engineered features generally used for per-pixel independent classification. Typically, a patch is fed into a classifier e.g. Random Forest [32, 2] or Boosting [36, 20] to predict the class probabilities of the center pixel. Features based on appearance [32], SfM and appearance [2, 36, 20] have been explored for the CamVid test. These per-pixel noisy predictions (often called unary terms) from the classifiers are then smoothed by using a pair-wise or higher order CRF [36, 20] to improve the accuracy. More recent approaches have aimed to produce high quality unaries by trying to predict the labels for all the pixels in a patch as opposed to only the center pixel. This improves the results of Random Forest based unaries [18] but thin structured classes are classfied poorly. Dense depth maps computed from the CamVid video have also been used as input for classification using Random Forests [43]. Another approach argues for the use of a combination of popular hand designed features and spatio temporal super-pixelization to obtain higher accuracy [39]. Recent top performing technique on the CamVid test [20] addresses the imbalance among label frequencies by using additional training data from the PASCAL VOC dataset to learn object detectors. The result of all these techniques indicates the need for improved classification as increases in accuracy have mostly come from adding new features or modalities to the classifier. Post-processing using CRF models of various orders [36] has mainly resulted in improving the accuracy of dominant classes such as sky, road, buildings with little effect on the accuracy of thin structured but equally important classes such as signs, poles, pedestrians. This highlights the need for better pixel-wise classification when imbalanced label frequencies exist.Meanwhile, indoor RGBD pixel-wise semantic segmentation has also gained popularity since the release of the NYU dataset [33] which showed the usefulness of the depth channel to improve segmentation. Their approach used features such as RGB-SIFT, depth-SIFT, location as input to a neural network classifier to predict pixel unaries. The noisy unaries are then smoothed using a CRF. Improvements were made using a richer feature set including LBP and region segmentation to obtain higher accuracy [28] followed by a CRF. In more recent work [33], both class segmentation and support relationships are inferred together using a combination of RGB and depth based cues. Another approach focusses on real-time joint reconstruction and semantic segmentation, where Random Forests are used as the classifier [13]. Gupta et al. [12] use boundary detection and hierarchical grouping before performing category segmentation. The common attribute along all these approaches is the use of hand engineered features for pixel-wise classifiction of either RGB or RGBD images. The application of deep learning for scene segmentation has only just begun. There have also been a few attempts to apply networks designed for categorization to segmentation, particularly by replicating the deepest layer features in blocks to match image dimensions [7, 6, 11, 8]. However, the resulting classification is blocky [11]. Another approach using recurrent neural networks [26] merges several low resolution predictions to create input image resolution predictions. On the whole, although some of these techniques already present improvements over hand engineered features [7].","Since a patch is fed into a classifier to predict the class probabilities of the center pixel, it is evident that image classification models for semantic segmentation.","Sure!

150,SegNet architecture is inspired from which domain?,"We draw inspiration of our encoder-decoder type architectures from probabilistic auto-encoders used to build generative models [24] and unsupervised learning of feature hierarchies [27]. Our main contribution is to learn an encoder-decoder stack trained in a modular and fully supervised manner for pixel-wise labelling. The addition of each deeper encoder-decoder pair results in an increased spatial context i.e., a 4 layer SegNet with 7\times 7 kernels and 2\times 2 non-overlapping max pooling in each layer has a spatial context of 106\times 106 pixels when a feature-map is backtracked to the input image. The SegNet predictions get smoother as more layers are added and demonstrate high accuracy, comparable to or even exceeding methods which use CRFs [36]. SegNet maintains a constant number of features per layer which is typically set to 64. This has a practical advantage that the computational cost successively decreases for each additional/deeper encoder-decoder pair. Our work is inspired by the unsupervised feature learning architecture proposed by Ranzato et. al [27]. The key learning module is an encoder-decoder network where the encoder consists of a filter bank convolution, tanh squashing function, max pooling followed by sub-sampling to obtain the feature maps. For each sample, the indices of the max locations computed during pooling are stored and passed to the decoder. The decoder upsamples the feature maps by using the already stored pooled indices, also called switches, and learns a decoder filter bank to reconstruct the input image. This architecture was used for unsupervised pre-training of feature hierarchies. A similar decoding technique is used for visualizing trained convolutional networks[42] for object classification; the transposed encoder kernels are set as the decoder kernels which are followed by a non-linearity and the pooling indices are used for upsampling. The architecture of Ranzato mainly concentrated on layer wise feature learning using small input patches although during test time a full sized image was the input. This discrepancy was corrected for by Kavukcuoglu et. al. [16] by using test size images/feature maps to learn hierarchical encoders. Both these approaches however did not attempt to use deep encoder-decoder networks for unsupervised feature training as they discarded the decoders after each encoder training. Here, the SegNet architecture differs from these approaches as the objective used for training all the encoder-decoder pairs is the same, i.e., to minimise the cross-entropy label loss.",SegNet architecture is inspired from generative models and unsupervised learning.,"In the RoBERTa case, the maximum value of N + M is 512",0.0909090859504134,0.0,0.0909090859504134,2.853183878886449,10.438850308641976,8.868367837676006,0.0442477876106194,0.0099009900990099,0.0501128062605857,0.2412138640780575,0.0501129440963268,0.158565953373909,0.0014511222830702,,0.7128696385569288,0.73597444197242
151,What are the total number of encoders and decoders used in SegNet?,"We draw inspiration of our encoder-decoder type architectures from probabilistic auto-encoders used to build generative models [24] and unsupervised learning of feature hierarchies [27].

SegNet maintains a constant number of features per layer which is typically set to 64. This has a practical advantage that the computational cost successively decreases for each additional/deeper encoder-decoder pair. We use mini-batches that maximize GPU usage and avoid GPU-CPU memory transfers. Typically, 25-50 randomly chosen images (with replacement) per mini-batch. The optimizer is run for 20 iterations per mini-batch and 10 epochs for each layer. We empirically observe that the objective plateaus after 5-6 epochs and so we run another 4 epochs as a margin. Note that, after 10 epochs, each input sample approximately “influences” the optimizer200 times. We train the encoder-decoder pair weights closest to the input layer. The soft-max layer can be trained first or randomly initialised. It then remains fixed throughout the experiment. Next, we introduce a deeper layer of encoder-decoder (see Fig. 2) and train their weights while holding the shallower layer encoder-decoder weights fixed. Note that the objective remains the same, i.e., to minimize label cross-entropy loss over the mini-batch. This is unlike unsupervised feature learning approaches which reconstruct the input of the layer in question [27, 16], thus varying the objective with each layer. The deconvolution network [42] on the other hand optimizes the same reconstruction objective with each deeper layer. The difference to our approach is (i) the objective is unsupervised, (ii) there is no encoder to learn a feed-forward representation thus requiring an optimisation step during test time to produce features for recognition. We successively add deeper encoder-decoder pairs and train them while holding the preceeding pair’s weights fixed. In total, we use 4 layer networks, i.e., 4 encoders and 4 decoders in our experiments. Once the encoder-decoder stack is trained, we find that there is no advantage to training the soft-max layer as it only relies on a linear discriminant function.We wrote our own Matlab GPU compatible implementation of SegNet that uses the minFunc optimization library [31]. Our code has been tested on NVIDIA Tesla K40, GTX GeForce 880M and GTXGeForce780 GPUs. We will make our light-weight Matlab code available publicly soon. With the current state of code optimisation, training a 4 layer deep SegNet on the CamVid dataset (367 training images of 360\times 480) takes about a week. The unoptimized test time is in the order of 2secs/frame: bulk of the computation time is spent performing tensor convolutions in the feedforward path and FFT based convolutions during backpropagation 333more speedup can be gained https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN.",4 encoders and 4 decoders are used in SegNet.,"The network receives a list of RoIs as input because it needs to focus on specific regions of the image when detecting objects, rather than processing the entire image at once",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.232779905234501,4.674584928925875,0.0,0.0099009900990099,0.140056699514389,0.2244134899897453,0.1400566846132278,0.46601203083992,0.0120119641687937,,0.7397424592006722,0.7598652299786746
152,How many features are used in each layer of SegNet?,"We draw inspiration of our encoder-decoder type architectures from probabilistic auto-encoders used to build generative models [24] and unsupervised learning of feature hierarchies [27]. Our main contribution is to learn an encoder-decoder stack trained in a modular and fully supervised manner for pixel-wise labelling. The addition of each deeper encoder-decoder pair results in an increased spatial context i.e., a 4 layer SegNet with 7\times 7 kernels and 2\times 2 non-overlapping max pooling in each layer has a spatial context of 106\times 106 pixels when a feature-map is backtracked to the input image. The SegNet predictions get smoother as more layers are added and demonstrate high accuracy, comparable to or even exceeding methods which use CRFs [36]. SegNet maintains a constant number of features per layer which is typically set to 64. This has a practical advantage that the computational cost successively decreases for each additional/deeper encoder-decoder pair. SegNet uses a “flat” architecture, i.e, the number of features in each layer remains the same (64 in our case) but with full connectivity. This choice is motivated by two reasons. First, it avoids parameter explosion, unlike an expanding deep encoder network with full feature connectivity (same for decoder). Second, the training time remains the same (in our experiments it slightly decreases) for each additional/deeper encoder-decoder pair as the feature map resolution is smaller which makes convolutions faster. Note that the decoder corresponding to the first encoder (closest to the input image) produces a multi-channel feature map although the encoder input is either 3 or 4 channels (RGB or RGBD) (see Fig. 1). This high dimensional feature representation is fed to the soft-max classifier. This is unlike the other decoders which produce feature maps the same size as their encoder inputs. A fixed pooling window of 2\times 2 with a stride of non-overlapping 2 pixels is used. This small size preserves thin structures in the scene. Further, a constant kernel size of 7\times 7 over all the layers was chosen to provide a wide context for smooth labelling i.e. a pixel in the deepest layer feature map can be traced back to a context window in the input image of 106\times 106 pixels. The trade-off here is between the size of the context window and retaining thin structures. Smaller kernels decrease context and larger ones potentially destroy thin structures.",64 features are used in each layer of SegNet.,"MobileNet models were trained with less regularization and data augmentation techniques compared to large networks like Inception V3, and with no weight decay on the depthwise filters.

154,Define local contrast normalization (LCN)?,"The input to the SegNet can be any arbitrary multi-channel image or feature map(s), e.g., RGB, RGBD, map of normals, depth etc. We perform local contrast normalization (LCN) as a pre-processing step to the input [23, 15]. The advantage of this step are many, (i) to correct for non-uniform scene illumination thus reducing the dynamic range (increases contrast in shadowed parts). (ii) highlighting edges which leads the network to learn category shape, (iii) improves convergence as it decorrelates the input dimensions [23]. LCN is performed independently for each modality, i.e., RGB is contrast normalized as a three channel input and depth as a single channel for RGBD inputs. This avoids highlighting pseudo depth edges due to RGB edges and vice-versa.","Local Contrast Normalization (LCN) is a pre-processing step that normalize the input to a non-uniform scene illumination, highlight edges, and decorrelates the input dimensions.

158,How long is this challenge been running?,"The key lesson of collecting the datasets and running the challenges for five years is this: All human intelligence tasks need to be exceptionally well-designed. We learned this lesson both when annotating the dataset using Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (Section 3) and evenwhen trying to evaluate human-level image classification accuracy using expert labelers (Section 6.4). The first iteration of the labeling interface was always bad – generally meaning completely unusable. If there was any inherent ambiguity in the questions posed (and there almost always was), workers found it and accuracy suffered. If there is one piece of advice we can offer to future research, it is to very carefully design, continuously monitor, and extensively sanity-check all crowdsourcing tasks.

There are 1000 object classes and approximately 1.2 million training images, 50 thousand validation images and 100 thousand test images. Table 2 (top) documents the size of the dataset over the years of the challenge. The selection of the 200 object detection classes in 2013 was guided by the ILSVRC 2012 classification and localization dataset.Starting with 1000 object classes and their bounding box annotations wefirst eliminated all object classes which tended to be too “big” in the image (on average the object area was greater than 50\% of theimage area). These were classes such as T-shirt, spiderweb, or manhole cover. We then manually eliminated all classeswhich we did not feel were well-suited for detection, such as hay, barbershop, or poncho. This left 494 object classeswhich were merged into basic-level categories: for example, different species of birds were merged into just the “bird” class.The classes remained the same in ILSVRC2014.Appendix D contains the complete list of object categories used in ILSVRC2013-2014 (in the context of the hierarchy described in Section 3.3.3). The scale of ILSVRC classification task (1000 categories and more than a million of images) makes it very expensive to label every instance of every object in every image. Therefore, on this dataset only one object category is labeled in each image. This creates ambiguity in evaluation. For example, an image might be labeled as a “strawberry” but contain both a strawberry and an apple. Then an algorithm would not know which one of the two objects to name. For the image classification task we allowed an algorithm to identify multiple (up to 5) objects in an image and not be penalized as long as one of the objects indeed corresponded to the ground truth label.

163,What added benefits do the ILSVRC provide over the existing PASCAL-VOC challenge?,"The ILSVRC dataset and the competition has allowed significant algorithmic advances in large-scale image recognition and retrieval. The closest to ILSVRC is the PASCAL VOC dataset (Everingham et al.,, 2010, 2014), which provides a standardized test bed for object detection, image classification, object segmentation, person layout, and action classification. Much of the design choices in ILSVRC have been inspired by PASCAL VOC and the similarities and differences between the datasets are discussed at length throughout the paper.ILSVRC scales up PASCAL VOC’s goal of standardized training and evaluation of recognition algorithms by more than an order of magnitude in numberof object classes and images: PASCAL VOC 2012 has 20 object classes and 21,738 images compared to ILSVRC2012 with 1000 object classes and 1,431,167 annotated images. In addition to the size of the dataset, we also analyze the level of difficulty of object localizationin these images compared to the PASCAL VOC benchmark. We compute statistics on the ILSVRC2012 single-object localizationvalidation set images compared to PASCAL VOC 2012 validation images. Prior to ILSVRC, the object detection benchmark was the PASCAL VOC challenge (Everingham et al.,, 2010).ILSVRC has 10 times more object classes than PASCAL VOC (200 vs 20), 10.6 times more fully annotated training images (60,658 vs 5,717), 35.2 times more training objects (478,807 vs 13,609),3.5 times more validation images (20,121 vs 5823) and 3.5 times more validation objects (55,501 vs15,787). ILSVRC has 2.8 annotated objects per image on the validation set, compared to 2.7 in PASCAL VOC. The average object in ILSVRC takes up 17.0\% of the image area and in PASCAL VOC takes up 20.7\%; Table 3 contains per-class comparisons.

Since we frame detection as a regression problem we don’t need a complex pipeline. We simply run our neural network on a new image at test time to predict detections. Our base network runs at 45 frames per second with no batch processing on a Titan X GPU and a fast version runs at more than 150 fps. This means we can process streaming video in real-time with less than 25 milliseconds of latency. Furthermore, YOLO achieves more than twice the mean average precision of other real-time systems. For a demo of our system running in real-time on a webcam please see our project webpage: http://pjreddie.com/yolo/. Fast YOLO is the fastest object detection method on Pascal; as far as we know, it is the fastest extant object detector. With 52.7\% mAP, it is more than twice as accurate as prior work on real-time detection. YOLO pushes mAP to 63.4\% while still maintaining real-time performance. On the VOC 2012 test set, YOLO scores 57.9% mAP. This is lower than the current state of the art, closer to the original R-CNN using VGG-16, see Table 3. Our system struggles with small objects compared to its closest competitors. On categories like bottle, sheep, and tv/monitor YOLO scores 8-10% lower than R-CNN or Feature Edit. However, on other categories like cat and train YOLO achieves higher performance. Fast YOLO is the fastest general-purpose object detector in the literature and YOLO pushes the state-of-the-art in real-time object detection. YOLO also generalizes well to new domains making it ideal for applications that rely on fast, robust object detection.","The baseline YOLO model shows 63.4% mAP at 45fps on the Pascal VOC dataset, while Fast YOLO is on 52.7 mAP at 150fps.

166,What are the metrics used to compare the performance between YOLO & DPM/RCNN?,"First we compare YOLO with other real-time detection systems on Pascal VOC 2007. To understand the differences between YOLO and R-CNN variants we explore the errors on VOC 2007 made by YOLO and Fast R-CNN, one of the highest performing versions of R-CNN [14]. Based on the different error profiles we show that YOLO can be used to rescore Fast R-CNN detections and reduce the errors from background false positives, giving a significant performance boost. We also present VOC 2012 results and compare mAP to current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show that YOLO generalizes to new domains better than other detectors on two artwork datasets. Many research efforts in object detection focus on making standard detection pipelines fast. [5] [38] [31] [14] [17] [28] However, only Sadeghi et al. actually produce a detection system that runs in real-time (30 frames per second or better) [31]. We compare YOLO to their GPU implementation of DPM which runs either at 30Hz or 100Hz. While the other efforts don’t reach the real-time milestone we also compare their relative mAP and speed to examine the accuracy-performance tradeoffs available in object detection systems. On the VOC 2012 test set, YOLO scores 57.9% mAP. This is lower than the current state of the art, closer to the original R-CNN using VGG-16, see Table 3. Our system struggles with small objects compared to its closest competitors. On categories like bottle, sheep, and tv/monitor YOLO scores 8-10% lower than R-CNN or Feature Edit. However, on other categories like cat and train YOLO achieves higher performance. YOLO has good performance on VOC 2007 and its AP degrades less than other methods when applied to artwork. Like DPM, YOLO models the size and shapeof objects, as well as relationships between objects and where objects commonly appear. Artwork and natural images are very different on a pixel level but they are similar in terms of the size and shape of objects, thus YOLO can still predict good bounding boxes and detections.","Different approaches to evaluating object detection models are presented in the paper where they mostly use mean average precision (mAP) and frames per second (fps) for accuracy and speed respectively. Qualitatively, the YOLO's errors are compared to R-CNN, and mAP on different classes of objects is shown. Moreover, YOLO was shown to boost the performance of R-CNN, and better generalize for new domains.","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

167,How did the authors verify that YOLO learns very general representation of objects ?,"YOLO is refreshingly simple: see Figure 1. A single convolutional network simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. YOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detection performance. This unified model has several benefits over traditional methods of object detection. Second, YOLO reasons globally about the image when making predictions. Unlike sliding window and region proposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image during training and test time so it implicitly encodes contextual information about classes as well as their appearance. Fast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes background patches in an image for objects because it can’t see the larger context. YOLO makes less than half the number of background errors compared to Fast R-CNN. Third, YOLO learns generalizable representations of objects. When trained on natural images and tested on artwork, YOLO outperforms top detection methods like DPM and R-CNN by a wide margin. Since YOLO is highly generalizable it is less likely to break down when applied to new domains or unexpected inputs.

168,"The authors claim that autonomous cars would be able to drive without specialized sensors using only fast and accurate algorithms, is that true ?","Humans glance at an image and instantly know what objects are in the image, where they are, and how they interact.

Fast, accurate algorithms for object detection would allow computers to drive cars without specialized sensors, enable assistive devices to convey real-time scene information to human users, and unlock the potential for general purpose, responsive robotic systems. YOLO still lags behind state-of-the-art detection systems in accuracy. While it can quickly identify objects in images it struggles to precisely localize some objects, especially small ones. We examine these tradeoffs further in our experiments.","Theoretically, if the detection algorithms were as fast and accurate as the human visual system, they could drive an autonomous car, but no further discussion is included in the paper.

169,"What does the authors means by reframing object detection as a ""single regression problem"" ?","Current detection systems repurpose classifiers to perform detection. To detect an object, these systems take a classifier for that object and evaluate it at various locations and scales in a test image. Systems like deformable parts models (DPM) use a sliding window approach where the classifier is run at evenly spaced locations over the entire image [10]. We unify the separate components of object detection into a single neural network. Our network uses features from the entire image to predict each bounding box. It also predicts all bounding boxes across all classes for an image simultaneously. This means our network reasons globally about the full image and all the objects in the image. The YOLO design enables end-to-end training and real-time speeds while maintaining high average precision. We reframe object detection as a single regression problem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities. Using our system, you only look once (YOLO) at an image to predict what objects are present and where they are. YOLO is refreshingly simple: see Figure 1. A single convolutional network simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. YOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detection performance. This unified model has several benefits over traditional methods of object detection. Object detection is a core problem in computer vision. Detection pipelines generally start by extracting a set of robust features from input images (Haar [25], SIFT [23], HOG [4], convolutional features [6]). Then, classifiers [36, 21, 13, 10] or localizers [1, 32] are used to identify objects in the feature space. These classifiers or localizers are run either in sliding window fashion over the whole image or on some subset of regions in the image [35, 15, 39]. We compare the YOLO detection system to several top detection frameworks, highlighting key similarities and differences. We introduce YOLO, a unified model for object detection. Our model is simple to construct and can be trained directly on full images. Unlike classifier-based approaches, YOLO is trained on a loss function that directly corresponds to detection performance and the entire model is trained jointly.","Reframing object detection as a simple regression problem means predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from image pixels avoiding complex pipelines and steps which most of the existing (classifier-based) methods do.

175,What motivated the authors to choose the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset to compare YOLO with other models ?,"First we compare YOLO with other real-time detection systems on Pascal VOC 2007. To understand the differences between YOLO and R-CNN variants we explore the errors on VOC 2007 made by YOLO and Fast R-CNN, one of the highest performing versions of R-CNN [14]. Based on the different error profiles we show that YOLO can be used to rescore Fast R-CNN detections and reduce the errors from background false positives, giving a significant performance boost. We also present VOC 2012 results and compare mAP to current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show that YOLO generalizes to new domains better than other detectors on two artwork datasets. To further examine the differences between YOLO and state-of-the-art detectors, we look at a detailed breakdown of results on VOC 2007. We compare YOLO to Fast R-CNN since Fast R-CNN is one of the highest performing detectors on Pascal and it’s detections are publicly available.","Although the paper does not give explicit reasons why Pascal VOC 2007 dataset was chosen for comparison, we can make an educated guess. It seems like Pascal VOC 2007 is one of the popular datasets for object detection. Also, many other existing methods had been evaluated on it, including Fast R-CNN models (the detections are also publicly available for Fast R-CNN). Additionally, the paper uses VOC 2012 and some other datasets for comparison too.",The authors optimized $\lambda_s$ and $\lambda_e$ using grid search,0.0285714263306124,0.0,0.0285714263306124,0.4285889246676481,10.658187973638965,8.488669907597433,0.0195058517555266,0.0012484394506866,0.0740150287747383,0.3968472886350841,0.2001861035823822,0.3804910778999328,0.0055711324314749,0.0,0.7840723833947086,0.7432739157606356

177,"Yolo makes different kinds of mistakes, but it is still really accurate, wouldn't that play against it when using it to boost Fast R-CNN ?","First we compare YOLO with other real-time detection systems on Pascal VOC 2007. To understand the differences between YOLO and R-CNN variants we explore the errors on VOC 2007 made by YOLO and Fast R-CNN, one of the highest performing versions of R-CNN [14]. Based on the different error profiles we show that YOLO can be used to rescore Fast R-CNN detections and reduce the errors from background false positives, giving a significant performance boost. We also present VOC 2012 results and compare mAP to current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show that YOLO generalizes to new domains better than other detectors on two artwork datasets. Second, YOLO reasons globally about the image when making predictions. Unlike sliding window and region proposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image during training and test time so it implicitly encodes contextual information about classes as well as their appearance. Fast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes background patches in an image for objects because it can’t see the larger context. YOLO makes less than half the number of background errors compared to Fast R-CNN. YOLO struggles to localize objects correctly. Localization errors account for more of YOLO’s errors than all other sources combined. Fast R-CNN makes much fewer localization errors but far more background errors. 13.6% of it’s top detections are false positives that don’t contain any objects. Fast R-CNN is almost 3x more likely to predict background detections than YOLO. YOLO makes far fewer background mistakes than Fast R-CNN. By using YOLO to eliminate background detections from Fast R-CNN we get a significant boost in performance. For every bounding box that R-CNN predicts we check to see if YOLO predicts a similar box. If it does, we give that prediction a boost based on the probability predicted by YOLO and the overlap between the two boxes. The boost from YOLO is not simply a byproduct of model ensembling since there is little benefit from combining different versions of Fast R-CNN. Rather, it is precisely because YOLO makes different kinds of mistakes at test time that it is so effective at boosting Fast R-CNN’s performance. YOLO still lags behind state-of-the-art detection systems in accuracy. While it can quickly identify objects in images it struggles to precisely localize some objects, especially small ones. We examine these tradeoffs further in our experiments. The best Fast R-CNN model achieves a mAP of 71.8%","Due to YOLO's architecture, it can handle the background objects better as it has a larger context (it processes the entire image end-to-end) when predicting bounding boxes compared to other models. However, YOLO struggles with localizing objects, especially small ones. On the other hand, Fast R-CNN can localize objects much better, but it has 3 times more problems (13.6%) with background errors compared to YOLO's 4.75%. Thus, assisting the best Fast R-CNN model with YOLO can give a 3.2% boost of accuracy (71.8% to 75%), because it can handle the background objects better.","By directly incorporating the target latency into the loss function during the search process, the proposed NAS method can find a baseline network that is optimized for both accuracy and latency on a specific NPU. Additionally, the post-processing step that adds SE blocks and h-swish activation functions can further improve the accuracy of the model while maintaining the latency",0.1071428523357782,0.0,0.0714285666214926,0.6130600719033608,27.090443717968927,22.954772833642,0.0852017937219731,0.0068137198290795,0.2675029039382934,0.4961669389461512,0.36058509349823,0.5389610528945923,0.0074377248181686,,0.7382833297024679,0.7588842897359357
178,Why does YOLO struggle in localizing objects correctly ?,"YOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding box predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes and can only have one class. This spatial constraint limits the number of nearby objects that our model can predict. Our model struggles with small objects that appear in groups, such as flocks of birds. YOLO shares some similarities with R-CNN. Each grid cell proposes potential bounding boxes and scores those boxes using convolutional features. However, our system puts spatial constraints on the grid cell proposals which helps mitigate multiple detections of the same object. Our system also proposes far fewer bounding boxes, only 98 per image compared to about 2000 from Selective Search. Finally, our system combines these individual components into a single, jointly optimized model. YOLO struggles to localize objects correctly. Localization errors account for more of YOLO’s errors than all other sources combined. Fast R-CNN makes much fewer localization errors but far more background errors. 13.6% of it’s top detections are false positives that don’t contain any objects. Fast R-CNN is almost 3x more likely to predict background detections than YOLO. On the VOC 2012 test set, YOLO scores 57.9% mAP. This is lower than the current state of the art, closer to the original R-CNN using VGG-16, see Table 3. Our system struggles with small objects compared to its closest competitors. On categories like bottle, sheep, and tv/monitor YOLO scores 8-10% lower than R-CNN or Feature Edit. However, on other categories like cat and train YOLO achieves higher performance. YOLO still lags behind state-of-the-art detection systems in accuracy. While it can quickly identify objects in images it struggles to precisely localize some objects, especially small ones. We examine these tradeoffs further in our experiments. Since our model learns to predict bounding boxes from data, it struggles to generalize to objects in new or unusual aspect ratios or configurations. Our model also uses relatively coarse features for predicting bounding boxes since our architecture has multiple downsampling layers from the input image. Finally, while we train on a loss function that approximates detection performance, our loss function treats errors the same in small bounding boxes versus large bounding boxes. A small error in a large box is generally benign but a small error in a small box has a much greater effect on IOU. Our main source of error is incorrect localizations.","Although YOLO is a really fast model, it usually struggles with localizing small objects in a group or objects near each other. In fact, localization errors take up more than half of all YOLO's errors. It happens because YOLO has only a limited number of bounding boxes per grid cell and the loss function penalizes the errors in the large and small bounding boxes the same. On top of that, the model uses coarse features to predict bounding boxes, and it may have problems with unusual aspect ratios and configurations of objects.","The authors' approach differs from these two categories by using end-to-end learning, which is not present in the two categories",0.069767438550568,0.0185185157407411,0.069767438550568,0.853756945814754,18.518786672529853,15.566050047812208,0.0429645542427497,0.0022172949002217,0.1155927553772926,0.5146725331646165,0.1791898012161255,0.2885705530643463,0.0127579169855217,,0.729746143395538,0.732912120258811
179,Why did the authors chose to train YOLO using VGG-16 and not other neural network architecture ?,"We also train YOLO using VGG-16. This model is more accurate but also significantly slower than YOLO. It is useful for comparison to other detection systems that rely on VGG-16 but since it is slower than real-time the rest of the paper focuses on our faster models. Our network architecture is inspired by the GoogLeNet model for image classification [34]. Our network has 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers. Instead of the inception modules used by GoogLeNet, we simply use 1 × 1 reduction layers followed by 3 × 3 convolutional layers, similar to Lin et al [22]. The full network is shown in Figure 3. We pretrain our convolutional layers on the ImageNet 1000-class competition dataset [30]. For pretraining we use the first 20 convolutional layers from Figure 3 followed by a average-pooling layer and a fully connected layer. We train this network for approximately a week and achieve a single crop top-5 accuracy of 88% on the ImageNet 2012 validation set, comparable to the GoogLeNet models in Caffe’s Model Zoo [24]. We use the Darknet framework for all training and inference [26]. We train the network for about 135 epochs on the training and validation data sets from PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012. When testing on 2012 we also include the VOC 2007 test data for training. Throughout training we use a batch size of 64, a momentum of 0.9 and a decay of 0.0005.","In fact, the base YOLO model and Fast YOLO have used GoogLeNet-inspired architecture to VGG-16. The authors claim that they have trained it with VGG-16 and it had better accuracy, however, it was too slow to be real-time.

Third, YOLO learns generalizable representations of objects. When trained on natural images and tested on artwork, YOLO outperforms top detection methods like DPM and R-CNN by a wide margin.

181,"What is ""“Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors” image representation ?","Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) [29]is a popular descriptor pooling method for both instance level retrieval [29] and image classification [22].It captures information about the statisticsof local descriptors aggregated over the image. Whereas bag-of-visual-words [14, 74] aggregation keeps countsof visual words, VLAD stores the sum of residuals (difference vector betweenthe descriptor and its corresponding cluster centre) for each visual word. Formally, given N D-dimensional local image descriptors \{\mathchoice{\mbox{\boldmath$\displaystyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\textstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptstyle\bf x$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptscriptstyle\bf x$}}_{i}\} as input,and K cluster centres (“visual words”) \{\mathchoice{\mbox{\boldmath$\displaystyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\textstyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptstyle\bf c$}}{\mbox{\boldmath$\scriptscriptstyle\bf c$}}_{k}\} as VLAD parameters,the output VLAD image representation V is K\times D-dimensional.For convenience we will write V as a K\times D matrix, but this matrixis converted into a vector and, after normalization, used asthe image representation.

195,"What does ""multi-orientation pooling"" means ?","Both of our new networks are sensitive to shape orientation, i.e., they capture different information at different orientations. To capture a more holistic sense of a 3D object, we add an orientation pooling stage that aggregates information from different orientations. Similar to Su-MVCNN [32] which aggregates information from multiple view inputs through a view-pooling layer and follow-on fully connected layers, we sample 3D input from different orientations and aggregate them in a multi-orientation volumetric CNN (MO-VCNN) as shown in Fig 5. At training time, we generate different rotations of the 3D model by changing both azimuth and elevation angles, sampled randomly. A volumetric CNN is firstly trained on single rotations. Then we decompose the network to \text{CNN}_{1} (lower layers) and \text{CNN}_{2} (higher layers) to construct a multi-orientation version. The MO-VCNN’s weights are initialized by a previously trained volumetric CNN with \text{CNN}_{1}’s weights fixed during fine-tuning. While a common practice is to extract the highest level features (features before the last classification linear layer) of multiple orientations, average/max/concatenate them, and train a linear SVM on the combined feature, this is just a special case of the MO-VCNN. Compared to 3DShapeNets [33] which only augments data by rotating around vertical axis, our experiment shows that orientation pooling combined with elevation rotation can greatly increase performance.","Multi-orientation pooling is a learning strategy in which the rotations around vertical axis are combined with the elevation rotations, although I am not sure what are elevation rotations.","To balance the data sample number or scale per class, eliminate the ""curse-of-dimensionality"" issue, and reduce the impact of class imbalance",0.0465116229745813,0.0,0.0465116229745813,1.633898440122165,18.404945081626657,15.292810461604292,0.0508474576271186,0.0077177508269018,0.2576059103012085,0.2874546731947008,0.2576058804988861,0.3100325465202331,0.004700150132756,0.0,0.8606106881478661,0.7464121774912209

197,How can auxiliary tasks help the volumetric CNN avoid overfitting and improve performances ?,"We propose two network variations that significantly improve state-of-the-art CNNs on 3D volumetric data.The first network is designed to mitigate overfitting by introducing auxiliary training tasks, which are themselves challenging. These auxiliary tasks encourage the network to predict object class labels from partial subvolumes. Therefore, no additional annotation efforts are needed. The second network is designed to mimic multi-view CNNs, as they are strong in 3D shape classification. Instead of using rendering routines from computer graphics, our network projects a 3D shape to 2D by convolving its 3D volume with an anisotropic probing kernel. This kernel is capable of encoding long-range interactions between points. An image CNN is then appended to classify the 2D projection. Note that the training of the projection module and the image classification module is end-to-end. This emulation of multi-view CNNs achieves similar performance to them, using only standard layers in CNN. We observe significant overfitting when we train the volumetric CNN proposed by [33] in an end-to-end fashion (see supplementary). When the volumetric CNN overfits to the training data, it has no incentive to continue learning. We thus introduce auxiliary tasks that are closely correlated with the main task but are difficult to overfit, so that learning continues even if our main task is overfitted.  These auxiliary training tasks also predict the same object labels, but the predictions are made solely on a local subvolume of the input.Without complete knowledge of the object, the auxiliary tasks are more challenging, and can thus better exploit the discriminative power of local regions. This design is different from the classic multi-task learning setting of hetergenous auxiliary tasks, which inevitably requires collecting additional annotations (e.g., conducting both object classification and detection [9]). We provide a detailed analysis over factors that influence the performance of volumetric CNNs, including network architecture and volumn resolution. Based upon our analysis, we strive to improve the performance of volumetric CNNs.We propose two volumetric CNN network architectures that signficantly improve state-of-the-art of volumetric CNNs on 3D shape classification. This result has also closed the gap between volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs, when they are provided with 3D input discretized at 30\times 30\times 30 3D resolution.The first network introduces auxiliary learning tasks by classifying part of an object, which help to scrutize details of 3D objects more deeply.The second network uses long anisotropic kernels to probe for long-distance interactions.

206,What are the difference and similarities between volumetric representations CNN &  multi-view representations CNN ?,"Two representations of generic 3D shapes are popularly used for object classification, volumetric and multi-view (Fig 1). The volumetric representation encodes a 3D shape as a 3D tensor of binary or real values. The multi-view representation encodes a 3D shape as a collection of renderings from multiple viewpoints. Stored as tensors, both representations can easily be used to train convolutional neural networks, i.e., volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs. Intuitively, a volumetric representation should encode as much information, if not more, than its multi-view counterpart.

A volumetric CNN based on voxel occupancy (green) is 7.3\% worse than a multi-view CNN (yellow). We investigate this performance gap in order to ascertain how to improve volumetric CNNs. The gap seems to be caused by two factors: input resolution and network architecture differences. The multi-view CNN down-samples each rendered view to 227\times 227 pixels (Multi-view Standard Rendering in Fig 1); to maintain a similar computational cost, the volumetric CNN uses a 30\times 30\times 30 occupancy grid (Volumetric Occupancy Grid in Fig 1)222Note that 30\times 30\times 30\approx 227\times 227.. As shown in Fig 1, the input to the multi-view CNN captures more detail.","The similarities between volumetric and multi-view representation are:
- when stored as tensors, both representations can easily be used to train convolutional neural networks, i.e., volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs.
- the multi-view CNN down-samples each rendered view to 227x227 pixels to maintain a similar computational cost, the volumetric CNN uses a 30x30x30 occupancy grid. Note that 30x30x30 is approximately 227x227. Therefore, the implementations have similar computational costs.

On the other hand, there are many differences:
- a volumetric representation should encode as much information, if not more, than its multi-view counterpart (however, experiments indicate that multi-view CNNs produce superior performance in object classification)
- the input to the multi-view CNN captures more detail.

207,What is the reasons that made the authors choose the 3D data from CAD model & RGB-D sensors ?,"We provide a new real-world scanning dataset benchmark, comprising 243 objects of 12 categories; the geometry is captured with an ASUS Xtion Pro and a dense reconstruction is obtained using the publicly-available VoxelHashing framework [25].For each scan, we have performed a coarse, manual segmentation of the object of interest.In addition, each scan is aligned with the world-up vector.While there are existing datasets captured with commodity range sensors – e.g., [29, 34, 31] – this is the first containing hundreds of annotated models from dense 3D reconstructions.The goal of this dataset is to provide an example of modern real-time 3D reconstructions; i.e., structured representations more complete than a single RGB-D frame but still with many occlusions. This dataset is used as a test set. In addition to providing extensive experiments on 3D CAD model datasets, we also introduce a dataset of real-world 3D data, constructed using dense 3D reconstruction taken with [25]. Experiments show that our networks can better adapt from synthetic data to this real-world data than previous methods. Wu et al. [33] lift 2.5D to 3D with their 3DShapeNets approach by categorizing each voxel as free space, surface or occluded, depending on whether it is in front of, on, or behind the visible surface (i.e., the depthvalue) from the depth map.The resulting representation is a 3D binary voxel grid, which is the input to a CNN with 3D filter banks.Their method is particularly relevant in the context of this work, as they are the first to apply CNNs on a 3D representation.A similar approach is VoxNet [24], which also uses binary voxel grids and a corresponding 3D CNN architecture.The advantage of these approaches is that it can process different sources of 3D data, including LiDAR point clouds, RGB-D point clouds, and CAD models; we likewise follow this direction.","The authors choose CAD models and RGB-D data for several reasons. First, to demonstrate that, while learning only the synthetic CAD models they are still able to generalize to real-world RGB-D reconstructions. Second, the RGB-D dataset is exclusively proposed in this paper, and it is purposely difficult (contains occlusions and reconstruction noise). Third, by using multiple sources of data, they demonstrate that the model is robust to different data types.","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

210,Is there a reason of not realizing pre-processing techniques to the real data to remove noise before the training ?,"Although the multi-view CNN presented by [32] produces compelling results, we are able to improve its performance through a multi-resolution extension with improved data augmentation.We introduce multi-resolution 3D filtering to capture information at multiple scales. We perform sphere rendering (see Sec 3) at different volume resolutions. Note that we use spheres for this discretization as they are view-invariant. In particular, this helps regularize out potential noise or irregularities in real-world scanned data (relative to synthetic training data), enabling robust performance on real-world scans. Note that our 3D multi-resolution filtering is different from classical 2D multi-resolution approaches, since the 3D filtering respects the distance in 3D. We further assess the performance of volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs on real-world reconstructions in Table 4. All methods are trained on CAD models in ModelNet40 but tested on real data, which may be highly partial, noisy, or oversmoothed (Fig 6).Our networks continue to outperform state-of-the-art results. In particular, our 3D multi-resolution filtering is quite effective on real-world data, possibly because the low 3D resolution component filters out spurious and noisy micro-structures. Example results for object retrieval can be found in supplementary.","The reason is that, in the real data, it will not always be possible to do the pre-processing steps, especially if they require tedious manual noise removal which cannot be completely done automatically. Thus, by using the noisy dataset, the authors demonstrate that their model is robust to real-world noise and occlusions.","The author adopted an attention mechanism as a base architecture of the model because it enables the system to focus on a targeted area within a context paragraph or image that is most relevant to answer the question, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the model",0.195121946267103,0.0,0.170731702364664,1.1677641075071654,29.13909138857069,25.144099361278982,0.1516562559151996,0.0094923648369789,0.2232620567083358,0.529485835024148,0.228717416524887,0.355802983045578,0.0118242416981899,0.0,0.7790866953368768,0.7920291376176969
211,"What does ""anisotropic probing kernel"" means ?","We propose two network variations that significantly improve state-of-the-art CNNs on 3D volumetric data.The first network is designed to mitigate overfitting by introducing auxiliary training tasks, which are themselves challenging. These auxiliary tasks encourage the network to predict object class labels from partial subvolumes. Therefore, no additional annotation efforts are needed. The second network is designed to mimic multi-view CNNs, as they are strong in 3D shape classification. Instead of using rendering routines from computer graphics, our network projects a 3D shape to 2D by convolving its 3D volume with an anisotropic probing kernel. This kernel is capable of encoding long-range interactions between points. An image CNN is then appended to classify the 2D projection. Note that the training of the projection module and the image classification module is end-to-end. This emulation of multi-view CNNs achieves similar performance to them, using only standard layers in CNN. Key to this network is the use of an elongated anisotropic kernel which helps capture the global structure of the 3D volume.As illustrated in Fig 4, the neural network has two modules: an anisotropic probing module and a network in network module.The anisotropic probing module contains three convolutional layers of elongated kernels, each followed by a nonlinear ReLU layer.Note that both the input and output of each layer are 3D tensors. In contrast to traditional isotropic kernels, an anisotropic probing module has the advantage of aggregating long-range interactions in the early feature learning stage with fewer parameters. As a comparison, with traditional neural networks constructed from isotropic kernels, introducing long-range interactions at an early stage can only be achieved through large kernels, which inevitably introduce many more parameters.After anisotropic probing, we use an adapted NIN network [23] to address the classification problem. Our anistropic probing network is capable of capturing internal structures of objects through its X-ray like projection mechanism. This is an ability not offered by standard rendering. Combined with multi-orientation pooling (introduced below), it is possible for this probing mechanism to capture any 3D structure, due to its relationship with the Radon transform. The two networks proposed above are both sensitive to model orientation. In the subvolume supervision method, different model orientations define different local subvolumes; in the anisotropic probing method, only voxels of the same height and along the probing direction can have interaction in the early feature extraction stage.Thus it is helpful to augment the training data by varying object orientation and combining predictions through orientation pooling. From Table 2, first, the two volumetric CNNs we propose, SubvolumeSup and AniProbing networks, both show superior performance, indicating the effectiveness of our design;second, multi-orientation pooling increases performance for all network variations. This is especially significant for the anisotropic probing network, since each orientation usually only carries partial information of the object.",The anisotropic probing kernels can be seen as a special type of convolutional layer. These kernels are elongated in 3D and can thus encode long-range interactions between the points. They are an alternative to using standard computer graphics rendering. Using anisotropic probing kernels helps to capture the global structure of the 3D volume.,"The target sequence is produced by the decoder LSTM taking over after the last input has been read by the encoder LSTM, and outputting a prediction for the target sequence, which is the same as the input sequence but in reverse order",0.1621621572534698,0.0,0.1081081031994158,1.0715752402052876,24.915705038330994,20.842667332360943,0.1232992566434707,0.0083300277667592,0.125783234834671,0.4608763047046476,0.1731911152601242,0.4257409572601318,0.0134954876883934,0.0,0.6928202608149229,0.7094539346080566
212,Why did the authors choose a format of the 3D input as 30x30x30 ?,"We investigate this performance gap in order to ascertain how to improve volumetric CNNs. The gap seems to be caused by two factors: input resolution and network architecture differences. The multi-view CNN down-samples each rendered view to 227\times 227 pixels (Multi-view Standard Rendering in Fig 1); to maintain a similar computational cost, the volumetric CNN uses a 30\times 30\times 30 occupancy grid (Volumetric Occupancy Grid in Fig 1)222Note that 30\times 30\times 30\approx 227\times 227.. As shown in Fig 1, the input to the multi-view CNN captures more detail.","The volumetric representation is costly - in order to keep the same computational cost as multi-view representation of 227x227, the volumetric representation can only have 30x30x30 resolution.

213,"Is it true, as the authors suggest, that a neural network's depth is essential to its success?","Many recent empirical breakthroughs in supervised machine learning have been achieved through large and deep neural networks. Network depth (the number of successive computational layers) has played perhaps the most important role in these successes. For instance, within just a few years, the top-5 image classification accuracy on the 1000-class ImageNet dataset has increased from \sim84% [1] to \sim95% [2, 3] using deeper networks with rather small receptive fields [4, 5].Other results on practical machine learning problems have also underscored the superiority of deeper networks [6] in terms of accuracy and/or performance. We see a different picture for the CIFAR-100 dataset (right) with performance degrading noticeably when removing any of the first \approx 40 layers.This suggests that for complex problems a highway network can learn to utilize all of its layers, while for simpler problems like MNIST it will keep many of the unneeded layers idle. Such behavior is desirable for deep networks in general, but appears difficult to obtain using plain networks. Our primary contribution is to show that extremely deep highway networks can be trained directly using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), in contrast to plain networks which become hard to optimize as depth increases (Section 3.1).Deep networks with limited computational budget (for which a two-stage training procedure mentioned above was recently proposed [25]) can also be directly trained in a single stage when converted to highway networks.

In fact, deep networks can represent certain function classes far more efficiently than shallow ones. This is perhaps most obvious for recurrent nets, the deepest of them all. For example, the n bit parity problem can in principle be learned by a large feedforward net with n binary input units, 1 output unit, and a single but large hidden layer. But the natural solution for arbitrary n is a recurrent net with only 3 units and 5 weights, reading the input bit string one bit at a time, making a single recurrent hidden unit flip its state whenever a new 1 is observed [7].Related observations hold for Boolean circuits [8, 9] and modern neural networks [10, 11, 12].","Deep architecture has made a lot of research and breakthroughs with this deep architecture, making it important that it can express many kinds of functions.",A bottom-up top-down feedforward structure refers to a type of neural network architecture that combines both bottom-up and top-down processing in a single feedforward process.

217,What are the difference between plain networks and deep highway networks ?,"Thus, depending on the output of the transform gates, a highway layer can smoothly vary its behavior between that of H and that of a layer which simply passes its inputs through. Just as a plain layer consists of multiple computing units such that the i^{th} unit computes y_{i}=H_{i}(\mathbf{x}), a highway network consists of multiple blocks such that the i^{th} block computes a block state H_{i}(\mathbf{x}) and transform gate output T_{i}(\mathbf{x}). Finally, it produces the block output y_{i}=H_{i}(\mathbf{x})*T_{i}(\mathbf{x})+x_{i}*(1-T_{i}(\mathbf{x})), which is connected to the next layer.222Our pilot experiments on training very deep networks were successful with a more complex block design closely resembling an LSTM block “unrolled in time”. Here we report results only for a much simplified form. To support the hypothesis that highway networks do not suffer from increasing depth, we conducted a series of rigorous optimization experiments, comparing them to plain networks with normalized initialization [16, 17]. The training curves for the best performing networks for each depth are shown in Figure 1. As expected, 10 and 20-layer plain networks exhibit very good performance (mean loss <1e^{-4}), which significantly degrades as depth increases, even though network capacity increases.Highway networks do not suffer from an increase in depth, and 50/100 layer highway networks perform similar to 10/20 layer networks. The 100-layer highway network performed more than 2 orders of magnitude better compared to a similarly-sized plain network.It was also observed that highway networks consistently converged significantly faster than plain ones. A possible objection is that many layers might remain unused if the transform gates stay closed. Our experiments show that this possibility does not affect networks adversely—deep and narrow highway networks can match/exceed the accuracy of wide and shallow maxout networks, which would not be possible if layers did not perform useful computations. Additionally, we can exploit the structure of highways to directly evaluate the contribution of each layer as shown in Figure 4. For the first time, highway networks allow us to examine how much computation depth is needed for a given problem, which can not be easily done with plain networks. Our primary contribution is to show that extremely deep highway networks can be trained directly using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), in contrast to plain networks which become hard to optimize as depth increases (Section 3.1).Deep networks with limited computational budget (for which a two-stage training procedure mentioned above was recently proposed [25]) can also be directly trained in a single stage when converted to highway networks.

219,"From the left graph of Figure 1, we observe that even the deepest highway network has same/worse performance than the plain network, so what are the benefits of using the highway networks with deeper layers ?","The training curves for the best performing networks for each depth are shown in Figure 1. As expected, 10 and 20-layer plain networks exhibit very good performance (mean loss <1e^{-4}), which significantly degrades as depth increases, even though network capacity increases.Highway networks do not suffer from an increase in depth, and 50/100 layer highway networks perform similar to 10/20 layer networks. The 100-layer highway network performed more than 2 orders of magnitude better compared to a similarly-sized plain network.It was also observed that highway networks consistently converged significantly faster than plain ones. One possible advantage of the highway architecture over hard-wired shortcut connections is that the network can learn to dynamically adjust the routing of the information based on the current input.This begs the question: does this behaviour manifest itself in trained networks or do they just learn a static routing that applies to all inputs similarly.A partial answer can be found by looking at the mean transform gate activity (second column) and the single example transform gate outputs (third column) in Figure 2.Especially for the CIFAR-100 case, most transform gates are active on average, while they show very selective activity for the single example.This implies that for each sample only a few blocks perform transformation but different blocks are utilized by different samples. We see a different picture for the CIFAR-100 dataset (right) with performance degrading noticeably when removing any of the first \approx 40 layers.This suggests that for complex problems a highway network can learn to utilize all of its layers, while for simpler problems like MNIST it will keep many of the unneeded layers idle. Such behavior is desirable for deep networks in general, but appears difficult to obtain using plain networks. Very deep highway networks, on the other hand, can directly be trained with simple gradient descent methods due to their specific architecture. This property does not rely on specific non-linear transformations, which may be complex convolutional or recurrent transforms, and derivation of a suitable initialization scheme is not essential.The additional parameters required by the gating mechanism help in routing information through the use of multiplicative connections, responding differently to different inputs, unlike fixed “skip” connections. A possible objection is that many layers might remain unused if the transform gates stay closed. Our experiments show that this possibility does not affect networks adversely—deep and narrow highway networks can match/exceed the accuracy of wide and shallow maxout networks, which would not be possible if layers did not perform useful computations. Additionally, we can exploit the structure of highways to directly evaluate the contribution of each layer as shown in Figure 4. For the first time, highway networks allow us to examine how much computation depth is needed for a given problem, which can not be easily done with plain networks. Our primary contribution is to show that extremely deep highway networks can be trained directly using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), in contrast to plain networks which become hard to optimize as depth increases (Section 3.1).Deep networks with limited computational budget (for which a two-stage training procedure mentioned above was recently proposed [25]) can also be directly trained in a single stage when converted to highway networks. Their ease of training is supported by experimental results demonstrating that highway networks also generalize well to unseen data.","Although highway networks do not perform well at best, they do not break down significantly when stacked deeply. Also, there is freedom in setting the number of depths, and it can be learned well with vanilla SGD.

220,What hyperparameters values were used to train both the plain and highway networks ?,"All networks were trained using SGD with momentum. An exponentially decaying learning rate was used in Section 3.1. For the rest of the experiments, a simpler commonly used strategy was employed where the learning rate starts at a value \lambda and decays according to a fixed schedule by a factor \gamma. \lambda, \gamma and the schedule were selected once based on validation set performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and kept fixed for all experiments.All convolutional highway networks utilize the rectified linear activation function [16] to compute the block state H. To provide a better estimate of the variability of classification results due to random initialization, we report our results in the format Best (mean \pm std.dev.) based on 5 runs wherever available. Experiments were conducted using Caffe [33] and Brainstorm (https://github.com/IDSIA/brainstorm) frameworks. Source code, hyperparameter search results and related scripts are publicly available at http://people.idsia.ch/~rupesh/very_deep_learning/. We trained both plain and highway networks of varying varying depths on the MNIST digit classification dataset.All networks are thin: each layer has 50 blocks for highway networks and 71 units for plain networks, yielding roughly identical numbers of parameters (\approx5000) per layer.In all networks, the first layer is a fully connected plain layer followed by 9, 19, 49, or 99 fully connected plain or highway layers. Finally, the network output is produced by a softmax layer.We performed a random search of 100 runs for both plain and highway networks to find good settings for the following hyperparameters: initial learning rate, momentum, learning rate exponential decay factor & activation function (either rectified linear or tanh). For highway networks, an additional hyperparameter was the initial value for the transform gate bias (between -1 and -10).

221,"Does it really assist bridge long-term temporal dependencies early in learning, as the authors say, to bias the gates in LSTM networks initially?","The transform gate biases of the two networks were initialized to -2 and -4 respectively.It is interesting to note that contrary to our expectations most biases decreased further during training.For the CIFAR-100 network the biases increase with depth forming a gradient.Curiously this gradient is inversely correlated with the average activity of the transform gates, as seen in the second column.This indicates that the strong negative biases at low depths are not used to shut down the gates, but to make them more selective.This behavior is also suggested by the fact that the transform gate activity for a single example (column 3) is very sparse.The effect is more pronounced for the CIFAR-100 network, but can also be observed to a lesser extent in the MNIST network.","Contrary to the authors' expectations, most of the biases were said to be reduced during training. In CIFAR-100, it is said that the biases increase according to the depth of the gradient. Authors explain that this is because strong negative biases at low depths are not used to close the gate.","The authors did not remove such cases prior to running the evaluation.

224,What do the authors mean by attention-aware features in the context of images ? ,"Not only a friendly face but also red color will draw our attention. The mixed nature of attention has been studied extensively in the previous literatures [34, 16, 23, 40]. Attention not only serves to select a focused location but also enhances different representations of objects at that location. Previous works formulate attention drift as a sequential process to capture different attended aspects. However, as far as we know, no attention mechanism has been applied to feedforward network structure to achieve state-of-art results in image classification task. Recent advances of image classification focus on training feedforward convolutional neural networks using “very deep” structure [27, 33, 10]. Soft attention developed in recent work [3, 17] can be trained end-to-end for convolutional network. Our Residual Attention Network incorporates the soft attention in fast developing feedforward network structure in an innovative way. Recent proposed spatial transformer module [17] achieves state-of-the-art results on house number recognition task. A deep network module capturing top information is used to generate affine transformation. The affine transformation is applied to the input image to get attended region and then feed to another deep network module. The whole process can be trained end-to-end by using differentiable network layer which performs spatial transformation. Attention to scale [3] uses soft attention as a scale selection mechanism and gets state-of-the-art results in image segmentation task. The Residual Attention Network alleviates above problems. In Attention Module, each trunk branch has its own mask branch to learn attention that is specialized for its features. As shown in Fig.1, in hot air balloon images, blue color features from bottom layer have corresponding sky mask to eliminate background, while part features from top layer are refined by balloon instance mask. Besides, the incremental nature of stacked network structure can gradually refine attention for complex images. The experiment results are shown in Table 1, the mixed attention has the best performance. Previous works normally focus on only one type of attention, for example scale attention [3] or spatial attention [17], which puts additional constrain on soft mask by weight sharing or normalization. However, as supported by our experiments, making attention change adaptively with features without additional constraint leads to the best performance. (1) Increasing Attention Modules lead to consistent performance improvement, as different types of attention are captured extensively. Fig.1 shows an example of different types of attentions for a hot air balloon image. The sky attention mask diminishes background responses while the balloon instance mask highlighting the bottom part of the balloon.","The authors are talking about features that were learned using the attention mechanism. The model focuses on such features, which can include color, scale, or spatial information, when it processes an image for classification. For example, the attention mechanism can learn that blue pixels in the background of the image from the sky are not important for image classification, and the model will consequently reduce the contribution of those pixels to the final classification result.","No, the authors did not evaluate the performance by specific domain.

227,What are the metrics used to compare the performance of the residual network to the other models ?,"In this section, we evaluate the performance of proposed Residual Attention Network on a series of benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 [19], and ImageNet [5].Our experiments contain two parts. In the first part, we analyze the effectiveness of each component in the Residual Attention Network including attention residual learning mechanism and different architectures of soft mask branch in the Attention Module.After that, we explore the noise resistance property. Given limited computation resources, we choose CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset to conduct these experiments. Finally, we compare our network with state-of-the-art results in CIFAR dataset.In the second part, we replace the Residual Unit with Inception Module and ResNeXt to demonstrate our Residual Attention Network surpasses origin networks both in parameter efficiency and final performance.We also compare image classification performance with state-of-the-art ResNet and Inception on ImageNet dataset. We train these networks using different mechanisms and summarize the results in the Table 3.As shown in Table 3, the networks trained using attention residual learning technique consistently outperform the networks trained with baseline method which proves the effectiveness of our method.The performance increases with the number of Attention Module when applying attention residual learning. In contrast, the performance of networks trained with “naive attention learning” method suffers obvious degradation with increased number of Attention Module. To understand the benefit of attention residual learning, we calculate mean absolute response value of output layers for each stage. We use Attention-164 to conduct this experiment.As shown in the Fig. 4, the response generated by the network trained using naive attention learning quickly vanishes in the stage 2 after four Attention Modules compared with network trained using attention residual learning.The Attention Module is designed to suppress noise while keeping useful information by applying dot product between feature and soft mask. However, repeated dot product will lead to severe degradation of both useful and useless information in this process.The attention residual learning can relieve signal attenuation using identical mapping, which enhances the feature contrast.Therefore, it gains benefits from noise reduction without significant information loss, which makes optimization much easier while improving the discrimination of represented features.In the rest of the experiments, we apply this technique to train our networks. We compare ResNet-164 network with Attention-92 network under different noise levels.The Table 5 shows the results.The test error of Attention-92 network is significantly lower than ResNet-164 network with the same noise level.In addition, when we increase the ratio of noise, test error of Attenion-92 declines slowly compared with ResNet-164 network.These results suggest that our Residual Attention Network can perform well even trained with high level noise data.When the label is noisy, the corresponding mask can prevent gradient caused by label error to update trunk branch parameters in the network.In this way, only the trunk branch is learning the wrong supervision information and soft mask branch masks the wrong label. We compare our Residual Attention Network with state-of-the-art methods including ResNet [11] and Wide ResNet [39] on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.The results are shown in Table 6.Our Attention-452 outperforms all the baseline methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.Note that Attention-92 network achieves 4.99\% test error on CIFAR-10 and 21.71\% test error on CIFAR-100 compared with 5.46\% and 24.33\% test error on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 for ResNet-164 network under similar parameter size.In addition, Attention-236 outperforms ResNet-1001 using only half of the parameters. It suggests that our Attention Module and attention residual learning scheme can effectively reduce the number of parameters in the network while improving the classification performance.

Our Residual Attention Network outperforms state-of-the-art residual networks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and challenging ImageNet [5] image classification dataset with significant reduction of computation (69% forward FLOPs). In this experiment, we explore the efficiency of proposed Residual Attention Network.We compare Attention-56 with ResNet-152 [10].The ResNet-152 has 50 trunk Residual Units and 60.2\times 10^{6} parameters compared with 18 trunk Residual Units and 31.9\times 10^{6} parameters in Attention-56.We evaluate our model using single crop scheme on the ImageNet validation set and show results in Table 7.The Attention-56 network outperforms ResNet-152 by a large margin with a 0.4\% reduction on top-1 error and a 0.26\% reduction on top-5 error.More importantly, Attention-56 network achieves better performance with only 52% parameters and 56% FLOPs compared with ResNet-152, which suggests that the proposed attention mechanism can significantly improve network performance while reducing the model complexity. When the basic unit is ResNeXt, the AttentionNeXt-56 network performance is the same as ResNeXt-101 while the parameters and FLOPs are significantly fewer than ResNeXt-101.For Inception, The AttentionIncepiton-56 outperforms Inception-ResNet-v1 [32] by a margin with a 0.94% reduction on top-1 error and a 0.21% reduction on top-5 error.The results show that our method can be applied on different network structures. We compare our Attention-92 evaluated using single crop on the ILSVRC 2012 validation set with state-of-the-art algorithms.Table 7 shows the results.Our Attention-92 outperforms ResNet-200 with a large margin. The reduction on top-1 error is 0.6\%.Note that the ResNet-200 network contains 32\% more parameters than Attention-92.The computational complexity of Attention-92 shown in the Table 7 suggests that our network reduces nearly half training time comparing with ResNet-200 by adding attention mechanism and reducing trunk depth.Above results suggest that our model enjoys high efficiency and good performance.","The main metrics used to compare different methods were Top-1 and Top-5 error, test error on the CIFAR datasets, the number of parameters and the number of FLOPs.

228,What are the consequences of stacking a really big number of attention module in the performance of attention modules? ,"However, naive stacking Attention Modules leads to the obvious performance drop.

However, repeated dot product will lead to severe degradation of both useful and useless information in this process.The attention residual learning can relieve signal attenuation using identical mapping, which enhances the feature contrast.Therefore, it gains benefits from noise reduction without significant information loss, which makes optimization much easier while improving the discrimination of represented features.In the rest of the experiments, we apply this technique to train our networks. We propose a Residual Attention Network which stacks multiple Attention Modules. The benefits of our network are in two folds: it can capture mixed attention and is an extensible convolutional neural network. The first benefit lies in that different Attention Modules capture different types of attention to guide feature learning. Our experiments on the forms of activation function also validate this point: free form mixed attention will have better performance than constrained (including single) attention. The second benefit comes from encoding top-down attention mechanism into bottom-up top-down feedforward convolutional structure in each Attention Module. Thus, the basic Attention Modules can be combined to form larger network structure. Moreover, residual attention learning allows training very deep Residual Attention Network. The performance of our model surpasses state-of-the-art image classification methods, i.e. ResNet on CIFAR-10 (3.90% error), CIFAR-100 (20.67% error), and challenging ImageNet dataset (0.6% top-1 accuracy improvement) with only 46\% trunk depth and 69\% forward FLOPs (comparing with ResNet-200). In the future, we will exploit different applications of deep Residual Attention Network such as detection and segmentation to better explore mixed attention mechanism for specific tasks. (1) Stacked network structure: Our Residual Attention Network is constructed by stacking multiple Attention Modules. The stacked structure is the basic application of mixed attention mechanism. Thus, different types of attention are able to be captured in different Attention Modules. (2) Attention Residual Learning: Stacking Attention Modules directly would lead to the obvious performance drop. Therefore, we propose attention residual learning mechanism to optimize very deep Residual Attention Network with hundreds of layers. ","If naive stacking, too many attention modules will cause a drastic performance drop as the mask values will converge to 0. However, the model in the paper uses their own stacking method, which avoids the downfall of naive stacking. The only consequence when using the paper's stacking method is that the model will require more parameters and FLOPs.",The proposed model has a higher learning rate than SRCNN,0.105263155001539,0.0,0.105263155001539,0.7446030455068398,14.51556911066157,12.68966748216032,0.0252100840336134,0.0017825311942959,0.3575620353221893,0.4342929879203439,0.3144993782043457,0.3094100654125213,0.0093438709128543,,0.7768006923830861,0.7990249543123238
229,How would stacking attention modules directly woud lead to performance drop? Why is the attention residual learning mechanism necessary?,"However, naive stacking Attention Modules leads to the obvious performance drop. First, dot production with mask range from zero to one repeatedly will degrade the value of features in deep layers. Second, soft mask can potentially break good property of trunk branch, for example, the identical mapping of Residual Unit. We propose attention residual learning to ease the above problems. Similar to ideas in residual learning, if soft mask unit can be constructed as identical mapping, the performances should be no worse than its counterpart without attention. Thus we modify output H of Attention Module asH_{i,c}(x)=(1+M_{i,c}(x))*F_{i,c}(x)(3)M(x) ranges from [0,1], with M(x) approximating 0, H(x) will approximate original features F(x). We call this method attention residual learning.Our stacked attention residual learning is different from residual learning. In the origin ResNet, residual learning is formulated as H_{i,c}(x)=x+F_{i,c}(x), where F_{i,c}(x) approximates the residual function. In our formulation, F_{i,c}(x) indicates the features generated by deep convolutional networks. The key lies on our mask branches M(x). They work as feature selectors which enhance good features and suppress noises from trunk features.In addition, stacking Attention Modules backs up attention residual learning by its incremental nature. Attention residual learning can keep good properties of original features, but also gives them the ability to bypass soft mask branch and forward to top layers to weaken mask branch’s feature selection ability. Stacked Attention Modules can gradually refine the feature maps. As show in Fig.1, features become much clearer as depth going deeper. By using attention residual learning, increasing depth of the proposed Residual Attention Network can improve performance consistently. As shown in the experiment section, the depth of Residual Attention Network is increased up to 452 whose performance surpasses ResNet-1001 by a large margin on CIFAR dataset. To understand the benefit of attention residual learning, we calculate mean absolute response value of output layers for each stage. We use Attention-164 to conduct this experiment.As shown in the Fig. 4, the response generated by the network trained using naive attention learning quickly vanishes in the stage 2 after four Attention Modules compared with network trained using attention residual learning.The Attention Module is designed to suppress noise while keeping useful information by applying dot product between feature and soft mask.

The attention residual learning mechanism changes this by making the lower bound of the mask values the original features instead of 0.","The unique characteristics of MUTAG and BGS datasets, such as the high-degree hub nodes and the presence of RDF format, contribute to the difference in performance compared to other datasets like AIFB and AM",0.1643835569149935,0.0430107481096085,0.136986296641021,1.921531915090591,26.39881749567809,23.903063496441167,0.0975975975975975,0.0056347364932051,0.1376657336950302,0.3674760699554641,0.2003253251314163,0.2507251501083374,0.0074779664298013,0.0,0.7146916415981747,0.7186970090043296
230,"What does ""bottom-up top-down feedforward structure"" means ?","However, recent advances of image classification focus on training feedforward convolutional neural networks using “very deep” structure [27, 33, 10]. The feedforward convolutional network mimics the bottom-up paths of human cortex. Various approaches have been proposed to further improve the discriminative ability of deep convolutional neural network. VGG [27], Inception [33] and residual learning [10] are proposed to train very deep neural networks. Stochastic depth [14], Batch Normalization [15] and Dropout [28] exploit regularization for convergence and avoiding overfitting and degradation. The design of soft attention structure in our Residual Attention Network is inspired by recent development of localization oriented task, i.e. segmentation [22, 25, 1] and human pose estimation [24]. These tasks motivate researchers to explore structure with fined-grained feature maps. The frameworks tend to cascade a bottom-up and a top-down structure. The bottom-up feedforward structure produces low resolution feature maps with strong semantic information. After that, a top-down network produces dense features to inference on each pixel. Skip connection [22] is employed between bottom and top feature maps and achieved state-of-the-art result on image segmentation. The recent stacked hourglass network [24] fuses information from multiple scales to predict human pose, and benefits from encoding both global and local information. Following previous attention mechanism idea in DBN [21], our mask branch contains fast feed-forward sweep and top-down feedback steps. The former operation quickly collects global information of the whole image, the latter operation combines global information with original feature maps. In convolutional neural network, the two steps unfold into bottom-up top-down fully convolutional structure. (3) Bottom-up top-down feedforward attention: Bottom-up top-down feedforward structure has been successfully applied to human pose estimation [24] and image segmentation [22, 25, 1]. We use such structure as part of Attention Module to add soft weights on features. This structure can mimic bottom-up fast feedforward process and top-down attention feedback in a single feedforward process which allows us to develop an end-to-end trainable network with top-down attention. The bottom-up top-down structure in our work differs from stacked hourglass network [24] in its intention of guiding feature learning.","The bottom-up top-down feedforward structure is a combination of a bottom-up fast feedforward process that creates low resolution features maps to quickly collect global information, and a top-down attention feedback process that uses the global information along with the original feature maps to create features for inference.",Other questions are not explicitly handled in the reviewed research.

It suggests that our Attention Module and attention residual learning scheme can effectively reduce the number of parameters in the network while improving the classification performance. We propose a Residual Attention Network which stacks multiple Attention Modules. The benefits of our network are in two folds: it can capture mixed attention and is an extensible convolutional neural network.

237,"They claim that in brain tumours, there is a hierarchical layout of sub-components. Is this True ? Any related experiments that proved it ?","The quantitative analysis of lesions requires accurate lesion segmentation in multi-modal, three-dimensional images which is a challenging task for a number of reasons. The heterogeneous appearance of lesions including the large variability in location, size, shape and frequency make it difficult to devise effective segmentation rules.It is thus highly non-trivial to delineate contusions, edema and haemorrhages in TBI (Irimia et al. (2012)), or sub-components of brain tumors such as proliferating cells and necrotic core (Menze et al. (2015)). The arguably most accurate segmentation results can be obtained through manual delineation by a human expert which is tedious, expensive, time-consuming, impractical in larger studies, and introduces inter-observer variability. Additionally, for deciding whether a particular region is part of a lesion multiple image sequences with varying contrasts need to be considered, and the level of expert knowledge and experience are important factors that impact segmentation accuracy. Hence, in clinical routine often only qualitative, visual inspection, or at best crude measures like approximate lesion volume and number of lesions are used (Yuh et al. (2012); Wen et al. (2010)). In order to capture and better understand the complexity of brain pathologies it is important to conduct large studies with many subjects to gain the statistical power for drawing conclusions across a whole patient population. The development of accurate, automatic segmentation algorithms has therefore become a major research focus in medical image computing with the potential to offer objective, reproducible, and scalable approaches to quantitative assessment of brain lesions. For brain tumors, we evaluate our system on the data from the 2015 Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BRATS) (Menze et al. (2015)). The training set consists of 220 cases with high grade (HG) and 54 cases with low grade (LG) glioma for which corresponding reference segmentations are provided. The segmentations include the following tumor tissue classes: 1) necrotic core, 2) edema, 3) non-enhancing and 4) enhancing core. The test set consists of 110 cases of both HG and LG but the grade is not revealed. Reference segmentations for the test set are hidden and evaluation is carried out via an online system. For evaluation, the four predicted labels are merged into different sets of whole tumor (all four classes), the core (classes 1,3,4), and the enhancing tumor (class 4)333For interpretation of the results note that, to the best of our knowledge, cases where the “enhancing tumor” class is not present in the manual segmentation are considered as zeros for the calculation of average performance by the evaluation platform, lowering the upper bound for this class.. For each subject, four MRI sequences are available, FLAIR, T1, T1-contrast and T2. The datasets are pre-processed by the organizers and provided as skull-stripped, registered to a common space and resampled to isotropic 1mm^{3} resolution. Dimensions of each volume are 240\times240\times155. We add minimal pre-processing of normalizing the brain-tissue intensities of each sequence to have zero-mean and unit variance. Finally, accurate delineation of the pathology is important in the case of brain tumors, where estimation of the relative volume of a tumor’s sub-components is required for planning radiotherapy and treatment follow-up (Wen et al. (2010)).",Previous literature state the importance of understanding the sub-component layout of brain tumors for diagnosis and treatment. It can therefore be inferred that these sub-components are created in a hierarchical way as the brain tumor develops.

238,What are the examples of the high level features that separate the anatomical structures for lesions regions identification ?,"The discriminative power of the learned features is indicated by the success of recent CNN-based systems in matching human performance in domains where it was previously considered too ambitious (He et al. (2015); Silver et al. (2016)). Analysis of the automatically extracted information could potentially provide novel insights and facilitate research on pathologies for which little prior knowledge is currently available. In an attempt to illustrate this, we explore what patterns have been learned automatically for the lesion segmentation tasks. We visualize the activations of DeepMedic’s FMs when processing a subject from our TBI database. Many appearing patterns are difficult to interpret, especially in deeper layers. In Fig. 14 we provide some examples that have an intuitive explanation. One of the most interesting findings is that the network learns to identify the ventricles, CSF, white and gray matter. This reveals that differentiation of tissue type is beneficial for lesion segmentation. This is in line with findings in the literature, where segmentation performance of traditional classifiers was significantly improved by incorporation of tissue priors (Van Leemput et al. (1999); Zikic et al. (2012)). It is intuitive that different types of lesions affect different parts of the brain depending on the underlying mechanisms of the pathology.

Results of other submissions are not accessible. The decrease in performance is possibly due to the the inclusion of test images that vary significantly from the training data, such as cases acquired in clinical centers that did not provide any of the training images, something that was confirmed by the organisers. Note that performance gains obtained with the CRF are larger in this case. This indicates not only that its configuration has not overfitted to the training database but also that the CRF is robust to factors of variation between acquisition sites, which complements nicely the more sensitive CNN. A general point should be made about the performance drop observed when our system is applied on test datasets of BRATS and ISLES in comparison to its cross-validated performance on the training data. In both cases, subsets of the test images were acquired in clinical centers different from the ones of training datasets. Differences in scanner type and acquisition protocols have significant impact on the appearance of the images. The issue of multi-center data heterogeneity is considered a major bottleneck for enabling large-scale imaging studies. This is not specific to our approach, but a general problem in medical image analysis. One possible way of making the CNN invariant to the data heterogeneity is to learn a generative model for the data acquisition process, and use this model in the data augmentation step. This is a direction we explore as part of future work.",The results show that the performance of the model drops when faced with testing data that was acquired by centers that did not provide any data in the training dataset. It can be inferred that having a more diverse dataset or utilizing techniques that can help make the CNN more robust to these differences can help generalization.,"The b in sub-role s^b_i represents the fact that each role s_i can be divided into n_i sub-roles, and when n_i = 1, the role s_i itself is a sub-role",0.2318840533501366,0.0240963810712738,0.1159420243646294,1.7914405838882346,22.035267855755887,19.909736877286203,0.0799289520426287,0.0058479532163742,-0.0264884103089571,0.2108160676134211,0.0825110971927642,0.2950209975242615,0.0097896641612877,0.0,0.7002227389228005,0.6957112977163563
240,Why does a deeper network with smaller kernel size have better performances ?,"Deeper networks have greater discriminative power due to the additional non-linearities and better quality of local optima (Choromanska et al. (2015)). However, convolutions with 3D kernels are computationally expensive in comparison to the 2D variants, which hampers the addition of more layers. Additionally, 3D architectures have a larger number of trainable parameters, with each layer adding C_{l}C_{l-1}\prod_{i=\{x,y,z\}}{\bm{\kappa}_{l}^{(i)}} weights to the model. C_{l} is the number of FMs in layer l and \bm{\kappa}_{l}^{\{x,y,z\}} the size of its kernel in the respective spatial dimension. Overall this makes the network increasingly prone to over-fitting. In order to build a deeper 3D architecture, we adopt the sole use of small 3^{3} kernels that are faster to convolve with and contain less weights. This design approach was previously found beneficial for classification of natural images (Simonyan and Zisserman (2014)) but its effect is even more drastic on 3D networks. When compared to common kernel choices of 5^{3} (Zikic et al. (2014); Urban et al. (2014); Prasoon et al. (2013)) and in our baseline CNN, the smaller 3^{3} kernels reduce the element-wise multiplications by a factor of approximately 5^{3}/3^{3}\approx 4.6 while reducing the number of trainable parameters by the same factor. Thus deeper network variants that are implicitly regularised and more efficient can be designed by simply replacing each layer of common architectures with more layers that use smaller kernels (Fig. 4).","Deeper networks exhibit better performance as they introduce more non-linearities and converge towards better local optima. But, adding more layers increase both computation time and the number of parameters. This could cause the network to be prone to overfitting. Therefore, kernel sizes were reduced such that the number of parameters were similar to the original shallow networks, helping with generalization by reducing overfitting while still receiving the positive effect of having more layers.",MNIST's small size and pre-built libraries and examples make it an ideal dataset for quickly testing and prototyping deep learning algorithms,0.026666662883556,0.0,0.026666662883556,0.5356571470331629,20.714558546817745,16.298933652275235,0.0269541778975741,0.0029490240134812,0.414363145828247,0.4629597154908899,0.4334273338317871,0.5471739768981934,0.0055309124488633,0.0,0.8233860197733601,0.7916702478831467
241,What are the signs that showed that BigDeep+ has been overfitting ?,"Figure 8 shows the improvement DeepMedic achieves over the single pathway model Deep+. In Fig. 9 we show two representative visual examples of this improvement when using the multi-scale CNN. Finally, we confirm that the performance increase can be accounted to the additional context and not the additional capacity of DeepMedic. To this end, we build a big single-scale model by doubling the FMs at each of the 9-layers of Deep+ and adding two hidden layers. This 11-layers deep and wide model, referred to as “BigDeep+”, has the same number of parameters as DeepMedic. The performance of the model is not improved, while showing signs of over-fitting.","As seen in Figure 8, despite BigDeep+ having a similar capacity to DeepMedic, the mean validation accuracy of BigDeep+ converges to a lower accuracy than that of DeepMedic. The same applies to the mean DSC for the two models. Therefore, it can be inferred that BigDeep+ is suffering from overfitting on the training data.","Normalization with zero-mean techniques has been shown to improve the performance of deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in medical image analysis tasks. This is because zero-mean normalization helps to reduce the effect of image intensity variations, which can be particularly important in medical imaging where image intensities can vary significantly between patients and even within the same image. Other normalization techniques, such as global normalization, may not be as effective in reducing these intensity variations and may even introduce artifacts into the images.

245,How did the authors showed that the methods performed worse on the data coming from the second clinical center? Using which metrics ?,"Table 3 shows the results of our method on the BRATS test data. Results of other submissions are not accessible. The decrease in performance is possibly due to the the inclusion of test images that vary significantly from the training data, such as cases acquired in clinical centers that did not provide any of the training images, something that was confirmed by the organisers. Note that performance gains obtained with the CRF are larger in this case. This indicates not only that its configuration has not overfitted to the training database but also that the CRF is robust to factors of variation between acquisition sites, which complements nicely the more sensitive CNN. For the testing phase of the challenge we formed an ensemble of three networks, coupled with the fully connected CRF. Our submission ranked first, indicating superior performance on this challenging task among 14 submissions. Table 5 shows our results, along with the other two top entries (Feng et al. (2015); Halme et al. (2015)). Among the other participating methods was the CNN of Havaei et al. (2015) with 3 layers of 2D convolutions. That method perfomed less well on this challenging task (Maier et al. (2017)). This points out the advantage offered by 3D context, the large field of view of DeepMedic thanks to multi-scale processing and the representational power of deeper networks. It is important to note the decrease of performance in comparison to the training set. All methods performed worse on the data coming from the second clinical center, including the method of Feng et al. (2015) that is not machine-learning based. This highlights a general difficulty with current approaches when applied on multi-center data. Quantitative results from the application of the DeepMedic, the CRF and an ensemble of three similar networks on the training data are presented in Table 2. The latter two offer an improvement, albeit fairly small since the performance of DeepMedic is already rather high in this task. Also shown are results from previous works, as reported on the online evaluation platform. Various settings may vary among submissions, such as the pre-processing pipeline or the number of folds used for cross-validation.

250,Why the slightest change in the textual prompt can lead to a completely different output image in the large-scale language-image models?,"Recently, large-scale language-image (LLI) models, such as Imagen saharia2022photorealistic , DALL·E 2 ramesh2022hierarchical  and Parti yu2022scaling , have shown phenomenal generative semantic and compositional power, and gained unprecedented attention from the research community and the public eye.These LLI models are trained on extremely large language-image datasets and use state-of-the-art image generative models including auto-regressive and diffusion models.However, these models do not provide simple editing means, and generally lack control over specific semantic regions of a given image. In particular, even the slightest change in the textual prompt may lead to a completely different output image. Our key observation is that the structure and appearances of the generated image depend not only on the random seed, but also on the interaction between the pixels to the text embedding through the diffusion process. By modifying the pixel-to-text interaction that occurs in cross-attention layers, we provide Prompt-to-Prompt image editing capabilities. More specifically, injecting the cross-attention maps of the input image \mathcal{I} enables us to preserve the original composition and structure. In section 3.1, we review how cross-attention is used, and in section 3.2 we describe how to exploit the cross-attention for editing. For additional background on diffusion models, please refer to appendix A. Numerous works ding2021cogview ; hinz2020semantic ; tao2020df ; li2019controllable ; li2019object ; qiao2019learn ; qiao2019mirrorgan ; ramesh2021zero ; zhang2018photographic ; crowson2022vqgan ; gafni2022make ; rombach2021highresolution  significantly advanced the generation of images conditioned on plain text, known as text-to-image synthesis. Several large-scale text-image models have recently emerged, such as Imagen saharia2022photorealistic , DALL-E2 ramesh2022hierarchical , and Parti yu2022scaling , demonstrating unprecedented semantic generation. However, these models do not provide control over a generated image, specifically using text guidance only.Changing a single word in the original prompt associated with the image often leads to a completely different outcome. For instance, adding the adjective “white” to “dog” often changes the dog’s shape.To overcome this, several works nichol2021glide ; avrahami2022blendedlatent  assume that the user provides a mask to restrict the area in which the changes are applied. Unlike previous works, our method requires textual input only, by using the spatial information from the internal layers of the generative model itself. This offers the user a much more intuitive editing experience of modifying local or global details by merely modifying the text prompt.",Because trained large models on large dataset lack control over generated images as it really depends on the random seed and the interaction between pixels to text embedding through the diffusion process which results in the spatial information from the internal layers of the generative model.,"No.

251,What are the examples in which important structural information is removed when masking the image content?,"To circumvent this, LLI-based methods nichol2021glide ; avrahami2022blendedlatent ; ramesh2022hierarchical require the user to explicitly mask a part of the image to be inpainted, and drive the edited image to change in the masked area only, while matching the background of the original image. This approach has provided appealing results, however, the masking procedure is cumbersome, hampering quick and intuitive text-driven editing. Moreover, masking the image content removes important structural information, which is completely ignored in the inpainting process. Therefore, some editing capabilities are out of the inpainting scope, such as modifying the texture of a specific object. As can be seen in fig. 6, our method is not confined to modifying only textures, and it can perform structural modifications, e.g., change a “bicycle” to a “car”. To analyze our attention injection, in the left column we show the results without cross-attention injection, where changing a single word leads to an entirely different outcome. From left to right, we then show the resulting generated image by injecting attention to an increasing number of diffusion steps. Note that the more diffusion steps in which we apply cross-attention injection, the higher the fidelity to the original image.However, the optimal result is not necessarily achieved by applying the injection throughout all diffusion steps. Therefore, we can provide the user with even better control over the fidelity to the original image by changing the number of injection steps.",Examples such as modifying textures of specific objects or changing bicycles in an image to a car.,The authors have used the pre-trained Imagen model as a base model in their experiments,0.1935483821436005,0.0,0.1290322531113425,2.8265205879007453,15.892928688924554,14.32502313654547,0.0847457627118644,0.0087463556851311,0.3722552955150604,0.3701053501239844,0.3722553253173828,0.408123642206192,0.0093536157244103,,0.7479198929048655,0.7705384492371222

In this paper, we introduce an intuitive and powerful textual editingmethod to semantically edit images in pre-trained text-conditioned diffusion models via Prompt-to-Prompt manipulations. To do so, we dive deep into the cross-attention layers and explore their semantic strength as a handle to control the generated image. Specifically, we consider the internal cross-attention maps, which are high-dimensional tensors that bind pixels and tokens extracted from the prompt text. We find that these maps contain rich semantic relations which critically affect the generated image.","To answer this question we need to recall the diffusion process, which is in order to predict the noise of an image we have two inputs 1- noisy image and 2- text embedding, and the interaction between the two inputs are fused using Cross-attention layers that produce spatial attention maps for each textual token. and that is what is meant by the interaction between pixels to text embedding.","Volumetric representations CNNs and multi-view representations CNNs have similarities and differences:

263,Attention maps are calculated by query of spatial feature of the noisy image (\phi(z_t)) and key of textual embedding (\psi(P)). Is it true?,"We use the Imagen saharia2022photorealistic  text-guided synthesis model as a backbone. Since the composition and geometry are mostly determined at the 64\times 64 resolution, we only adapt the text-to-image diffusion model, using the super-resolution process as is.Recall that each diffusion step t consists of predicting the noise \epsilon from a noisy image z_{t} and text embedding \psi(\mathcal{P}) using a U-shaped network ronneberger2015u . At the final step, this process yields the generated image \mathcal{I}=z_{0}.Most importantly, the interaction between the two modalities occurs during the noise prediction, where the embeddings of the visual and textual features are fused using Cross-attention layers that produce spatial attention maps for each textual token. More formally, as illustrated in fig. 3(Top), the deep spatial features of the noisy image \phi(z_{t}) are projected to a query matrix Q=\ell_{Q}(\phi(z_{t})), and the textual embedding is projected to a key matrix K=\ell_{K}(\psi(\mathcal{P})) and a value matrix V=\ell_{V}(\psi(\mathcal{P})), via learned linear projections \ell_{Q},\ell_{K},\ell_{V}.The attention maps are thenM=\text{Softmax}\left(\frac{QK^{T}}{\sqrt{d}}\right),(1)where the cell M_{ij} defines the weight of the value of the j-th token on the pixel i, and where d is the latent projection dimension of the keys and queries.

In this paper, we introduce an intuitive and powerful textual editingmethod to semantically edit images in pre-trained text-conditioned diffusion models via Prompt-to-Prompt manipulations. To do so, we dive deep into the cross-attention layers and explore their semantic strength as a handle to control the generated image.

264,How can the authors verify if the attention reflects the overall composition of the given image? ,"Our key observation is that the structure and appearances of the generated image depend not only on the random seed, but also on the interaction between the pixels to the text embedding through the diffusion process. By modifying the pixel-to-text interaction that occurs in cross-attention layers, we provide Prompt-to-Prompt image editing capabilities. More specifically, injecting the cross-attention maps of the input image \mathcal{I} enables us to preserve the original composition and structure. In section 3.1, we review how cross-attention is used, and in section 3.2 we describe how to exploit the cross-attention for editing. For additional background on diffusion models, please refer to appendix A. We return to our key observation — the spatial layout and geometry of the generated image depend on the cross-attention maps. This interaction between pixels and text is illustrated in fig. 4, where the average attention maps are plotted. As can be seen, pixels are more attracted to the words that describe them, e.g., pixels of the bear are correlated with the word “bear”. Note that averaging is done for visualization purposes, and attention maps are kept separate for each head in our method.Interestingly, we can see that the structure of the image is already determined in the early steps of the diffusion process.","Injecting the cross-attention maps of the input image enabled the authors to preserve the original composition and structure, and as illustrated in Figure. 4, The average attention maps are plotted, and pixels are more attracted to words that describe them, e.g. pixels of the bear in the image are correlated with the word ""bear"".

265,"How does the timestamp \tau control for stylization, specification of object attributes, or global manipulations for editing image by text prompt?","Since the attention reflects the overall composition, we can inject the attention maps M that were obtained from the generation with the original prompt \mathcal{P}, into a second generation with the modified prompt \mathcal{P}^{*}. This allows the synthesis of an edited image \mathcal{I}^{*} that is not only manipulated according to the edited prompt, but also preserves the structure of the input image \mathcal{I}. This example is a specific instance of a broader set of attention-based manipulations leading to different types of intuitive editing. We, therefore, start by proposing a general framework, followed by the details of the specific editing operations. Edit(M_{t},M_{t}^{*},t):=\begin{cases}M_{t}^{*}&\quad\text{if}\;t<\tau\\M_{t}&\quad\text{otherwise.}\\\end{cases}where \tau is a timestamp parameter that determines until which step the injection is applied.Note that the composition is determined in the early steps of the diffusion process. Therefore, by limiting the number of injection steps, we can guide the composition of the newly generated image while allowing the necessary geometry freedom for adapting to the new prompt. An illustration is provided in section 4. Another natural relaxation for our algorithm is to assign a different number of injection timestamps for the different tokens in the prompt. In case the two words are represented using a different number of tokens, the maps can be duplicated/averaged as necessary using an alignment function as described in the next paragraph. Our key idea is that we can edit images by injecting the cross-attention maps during the diffusion process, controlling which pixels attend to which tokens of the prompt text during which diffusion steps. To apply our method to various creative editing applications, we show several methods to control the cross-attention maps through a simple and semantic interface (see fig. 1). The first is to change a single token’s value in the prompt (e.g., “dog” to “cat”), while fixing the cross-attention maps, to preserve the scene composition. The second is to globally edit an image, e.g., change the style, by adding new words to the prompt and freezing the attention on previous tokens, while allowing new attention to flow to the new tokens. The third is to amplify or attenuate the semantic effect of a word in the generated image.","The overall composition is reflected by the attenion maps, which can be injected during the diffusion process at controled time-step, which allows the necessary freedom for adapting the new prompt.

266,Did the method proposed in this paper perform on par with or better than the state-of-the-art methods that require users to provide spatial masks for editing?,"To circumvent this, LLI-based methods nichol2021glide ; avrahami2022blendedlatent ; ramesh2022hierarchical require the user to explicitly mask a part of the image to be inpainted, and drive the edited image to change in the masked area only, while matching the background of the original image. This approach has provided appealing results, however, the masking procedure is cumbersome, hampering quick and intuitive text-driven editing. Moreover, masking the image content removes important structural information, which is completely ignored in the inpainting process. Therefore, some editing capabilities are out of the inpainting scope, such as modifying the texture of a specific object. In this paper, we introduce an intuitive and powerful textual editingmethod to semantically edit images in pre-trained text-conditioned diffusion models via Prompt-to-Prompt manipulations. To do so, we dive deep into the cross-attention layers and explore their semantic strength as a handle to control the generated image. Specifically, we consider the internal cross-attention maps, which are high-dimensional tensors that bind pixels and tokens extracted from the prompt text. We find that these maps contain rich semantic relations which critically affect the generated image. Our method, described in section 3, enables intuitive text-only editing by controlling the spatial layout corresponding to each word in the user-provided prompt. In this section, we show several applications using this technique. Text-Only Localized Editing.We first demonstrate localized editing by modifying the user-provided prompt without requiring any user-provided mask. In fig. 2, we depict an example where we generate an image using the prompt “lemon cake”. Our method allows us to retain the spatial layout, geometry, and semantics when replacing the word “lemon” with “pumpkin” (top row). Observe that the background is well-preserved, including the top-left lemons transforming into pumpkins. On the other hand, naively feeding the synthesis model with the prompt “pumpkin cake” results in a completely different geometry (3rd row), even when using the same random seed in a deterministic setting (i.e., DDIM song2020denoising ). Our method succeeds even for a challenging prompt such as “pasta cake.” (2nd row) — the generated cake consists of pasta layers with tomato sauce on top. Another example is provided in fig. 5 where we do not inject the attention of the entire prompt but only the attention of a specific word – “butterfly”. This enables the preservation of the original butterfly while changing the rest of the content. Additional results are provided in the appendix (fig. 13). In this work, we uncovered the powerful capabilities of the cross-attention layers within text-to-image diffusion models.We showed that these high-dimensional layers have an interpretable representation of spatial maps that play a key role in tying the words in the text prompt to the spatial layout of the synthesized image.With this observation, we showed how various manipulations of the prompt can directly control attributes in the synthesized image, paving the way to various applications including local and global editing.This work is a first step towards providing users with simple and intuitive means to edit images, leveraging textual semantic power. It enables users to navigate through a semantic, textual, space, which exhibits incremental changes after each step, rather than producing the desired image from scratch after each text manipulation. Our approach constitutes an intuitive image editing interface through editing only the textual prompt, therefore called Prompt-to-Prompt. This method enables various editing tasks, which are challenging otherwise, and does not requires model training, fine-tuning, extra data, or optimization. Throughout our analysis, we discover even more control over the generation process, recognizing a trade-off between the fidelity to the edited prompt and the source image. We even demonstrate that our method can be applied to real images by using an existing inversion process. Our experiments and numerous results show that our method enables seamless editing in an intuitive text-based manner over extremely diverse images. While most works that require only text (i.e., no masks) are limited to global editing crowson2022vqgan ; kwon2021clipstyler ,Bar-Tal et al. bar2022text2live  proposed a text-based localized editing technique without using any mask, showing impressive results.Yet, their techniques mainly allow changing textures, but not modifying complex structures, such as changing a bicycle to a car.Moreover, unlike our method, their approach requires training a network for each input. Unlike previous works, our method requires textual input only, by using the spatial information from the internal layers of the generative model itself. This offers the user a much more intuitive editing experience of modifying local or global details by merely modifying the text prompt.","Yes their method did perform better than mask editing methods, as authors demonstrated by examples that their method is more intuitive for users using only prompt, and doesn't require to explicitly mask parts of the image which results to remove important structural information and doesn't modify complex structures information.

Is it right?,"More formally, as illustrated in fig. 3(Top), the deep spatial features of the noisy image \phi(z_{t}) are projected to a query matrix Q=\ell_{Q}(\phi(z_{t})), and the textual embedding is projected to a key matrix K=\ell_{K}(\psi(\mathcal{P})) and a value matrix V=\ell_{V}(\psi(\mathcal{P})), via learned linear projections \ell_{Q},\ell_{K},\ell_{V}.The attention maps are thenM=\text{Softmax}\left(\frac{QK^{T}}{\sqrt{d}}\right),(1)where the cell M_{ij} defines the weight of the value of the j-th token on the pixel i, and where d is the latent projection dimension of the keys and queries.

269,Who is responsible for designating the control signal?,"Image captioning, \ie, generating fluent and meaningful descriptions to summarize the salient contents of an image, is a classic proxy task for comprehensive scene understanding [21]. With the release of several large scale datasets and advanced encoder-decoder frameworks, current captioning models plausibly have already achieved “super-human” performance in all accuracy-based evaluation metrics. However, many studies have indicated that these models tend to produce generic descriptions, and fail to control the caption generation process as humans, \eg, referring to different contents of interest or descriptive patterns. In order to endow the captioning models with human-like controllability, a recent surge of efforts [16, 10, 19, 78, 48, 77, 27, 20] resort to introducing extra control signals as constraints of the generated captions, called Controllable Image Captioning (CIC). As a byproduct, the CIC models can easily generate diverse descriptions by feeding different control signals. For human-like controllable image captioning, we first propose the Verb-specific Semantic Roles (VSR) as the control signal for generating customized captions. As shown in Figure 3, we formally represent a control signal VSR as:𝒱𝒮ℛ={v,<s1,n1>,…,<sm,nm>},\displaystyle\begin{aligned} \mathcal{VSR}=\{v,<s_{1},n_{1}>,...,<s_{m},n_{m}>\},\\\end{aligned}start_ROW start_CELL caligraphic_V caligraphic_S caligraphic_R = { italic_v , < italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > , … , < italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > } , end_CELL end_ROW(1)where v is a verb capturing the scope of a salient activity in the image (\eg, ride), s_{i} is a semantic role of verb v (\eg, LOC), and n_{i} is the number of interested entities in the role s_{i}. For example, for 𝒱𝒮ℛ={𝚛𝚒𝚍𝚎,<𝙰𝚛𝚐𝟶,𝟷>,<𝙰𝚛𝚐𝟷,𝟷>,<𝙻𝚘𝚌,𝟸>}\mathcal{VSR}=\{\texttt{ride},<\texttt{Arg0},\texttt{1}>,<\texttt{Arg1},\texttt{1}>,<\texttt{Loc},\texttt{2}>\}caligraphic_V caligraphic_S caligraphic_R = { ride , < Arg0 , 1 > , < Arg1 , 1 > , < Loc , 2 > }, we hope to generate a caption which not only focuses on describing the ride activity, but also contains one entity respectively in the role Arg0{}_{\text{rider}} and Arg1{}_{\text{steed}}, and two entities in the role LOC. Thus, VSR can effectively control the amount of information carried in the whole sentence and each role, \ie, the level of details. In this paper, we argued that all existing objective control signals for CIC have overlooked two indispensable characteristics: event-compatible and sample-suitable. To this end, we proposed a novel control signal called VSR. VSR consists of a verb and several semantic roles, \ie, all components are guaranteed to be event-compatible. Meanwhile, VSR only restricts the involved semantic roles, which is also sample-suitable for all the images containing the activity. We have validated the effectiveness of VSR through extensive experiments. Moving forward, we will plan to 1) design a more effective captioning model to benefit more from the VSR signals; 2) extend VSR to other controllable text generation tasks, \eg, video captioning [69]; 3) design a more general framework to cover the images without verbs. In summary, we make three contributions in this paper:1.We propose a new control signal for CIC: Verb-specific Semantic Roles (VSR). To the best of our knowledge, VSR is the first control signal to consider both event-compatible and sample-suitable requirements222When using control signals extracted from GT captions, existing control signals can always meet both requirements and generate reasonable captions. However, in more general settings (\eg, construct control signals without GT captions), the form of VSR is more human-friendly, and it is easier to construct signals which meet both requirements compared with all existing forms of control signals, which is the main advantage of VSR..2.We can learn human-like verb-specific semantic structures automatically, and abundant visualization examples demonstrate that these patterns are reasonable.3.We achieve state-of-the-art controllability on two challenging benchmarks, and generate diverse captions by using different verbs, semantic roles, or structures. Controllable Image Captioning.Compared with conventional image captioning [63, 68, 9, 25, 13], CIC is a more challenging task, which needs to consider extra constraints. Early CIC works are mostly about stylized image captioning, \ie, constraints are the linguistic styles of sentences. According to the requirements of parallel training samples, existing solutions can be divided into two types: models using parallel stylized image-caption data [41, 11, 54, 1] or not [22, 42]. Subsequently, the community gradually shifts the emphasis to controlling described contents [16, 77, 27, 10, 78, 48, 35] or structures [20, 19, 75, 76] of the sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel control signal VSR, which is the first control signal to consider both the event-compatible and sample-suitable requirements.","control signal is designated by each author in their work. as the authors of this paper proposed a ""verb-specific semantic role"" ""VSR"" as control signal for customized captions. while a recent surge of efforts by other works introduced extra control signals as constrains of the generated captions [16, 10, 19, 78, 48, 77, 27, 20].","English Wikipedia, BookCorpus, Stories, OpenWebText, CC-NEWS, and C4.En",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7962770907450394,10.664424558100286,10.61932814846212,0.0383435582822085,0.0014524328249818,0.1718544960021972,0.1943859183642478,0.1765110194683075,0.1446455121040344,0.0031432157806288,0.0,0.7109508836419792,0.7563222973239241
270,What is the example of ideal control signal?,"Nevertheless, all existing objective control signals (\ie, both content-controlled and structure-controlled) have overlooked two indispensable characteristics of an ideal control signal towards “human-like” controllable image captioning: 1) Event-compatible: all visual contents referred to in a single sentence should be compatible with the described activity. Imaging how humans describe images — our brains always quickly structure a descriptive pattern like “sth do sth at someplace” first, and then fill in the detailed description [56, 46, 30, 71], \ie, we have subconsciously made sure that all the mentioned entities are event-compatible (\eg, man, wave, surfboard are all involved in activity riding in Figure 1 (a)). To further see the negative impact of dissatisfying this requirement, suppose that we deliberately utilize two more objects (hand and sky, \ie, ) as part of the control signal, and the model generates an incoherent and illogical caption. 2) Sample-suitable: the control signals should be suitable for the specific image sample. By “suitable”, we mean that there do exist reasonable descriptions satisfying the control signals, \eg, a large length-level may not be suitable for an image with a very simple scene. Unfortunately, it is always very difficult to decide whether a control signal is sample-suitable in advance. For example in Figure 1 (b), although the two control signals (\ie, length-levels 3 and 4) are quite close, the quality of respectively generated captions varies greatly.","Figure 1 (a) and Figure 1 (b), are examples of two indispensable characteristics ideal control signal, as Figure 1 (a) elaborates the ""Event Compatibility"" characteristic as ""man, wave, surfboard"" are all involved in activity riding. and Figure 1 (b) elaborates the ""Sample-suitability"" characteristic as the two control signal (length-levels 3 and 4) are quite close, but the quality of respectively generated captions varies greatly.",No,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6578947368421054,0.4385964912280702,0.0,0.0001562255897516,-0.0068147298879921,0.3506178259849548,0.0003997366584371,,0.00036797151216,,0.8633634565217906,0.7217490177670587
271,How does a role-shift captioning model contribute to generating captions?,"Given the semantic structure sequence \mathcal{S}=(s^{b}_{1},...,s^{b}_{K}) and corresponding proposal feature sequence \mathcal{R}=(\bm{r}_{1},...,\bm{r}_{K}), we utilize a two-layer LSTM to generate the final caption \bm{y}. At each time step, the model fouces on one specific sub-role \bm{s}^{b}_{t} and its grounded region set \bm{r}_{t}, and then generates the word y_{t}. Therefore, we take inspirations from previous CIC methods [16, 10], and predict two distributions simultaneously: p(g_{t}|\mathcal{S},\mathcal{R}) for controlling the shift of sub-roles, and p(y_{t}|\mathcal{S},\mathcal{R}) to predict the distribution of a word. In order to generate sentences with respect to the designated VSRs, we first train a grounded semantic role labeling (GSRL) model to identify and ground all entities for each role. Then, we propose a semantic structure planner (SSP) to rank the given verb and semantic roles, and output some human-like descriptive semantic structures, \eg, Arg0{}_{\text{reader}} – read – Arg1{}_{\text{thing}} – LOC in Figure 1 (c). Finally, we combine the grounded entities and semantic structures, and use an RNN-based role-shift captioning model to generate the captions by sequentially focusing on different roles.","By using RNN-based-role-shift caption model consists of two LSTM layers. the model generates the word ""yt"", by taking two inputs to the model which are 1- Semantic structure sequence, and 2- corresponding proposal feature sequence. then at each time step the model focus on one specific sub-role and its grounded region set.","1.

272,How do the authors verify that the two characteristics mentioned in the sentence are indispensable for the ideal control signal?  ,"Settings. To evaluate the controllability of proposed framework, we followed the conventions of prior CIC works [16, 10, 78], and utilized the VSR aligned with ground truth captions as the control signals. Specifically, we compared the proposed framework with several carefully designed baselines666All baselines use the same visual regions as models with VSRs.: 1) C-LSTM: It is a Controllable LSTM model [63]. Given the features of all grounded visual regions, it first averages all region features, and then uses an LSTM to generate the captions. 2) C-UpDn: It is a Controllable UpDn model [3], which uses an adaptive attention to generate the captions. 3) SCT [16]: It regards the set of visual regions as a control signal, and utilizes a chunk-shift captioning model to generate the captions. 4) Ours w/o verb: We ablate our model by removing the verb information in both the SSP and captioning model. 5) Ours (oracle verb): It is an ideal situation, where the captioning model directly outputs the oracle format of the verb when the attending role is the verb. Quantitative Results. The quantitative results are reported in Table 1. From Table 1, we can observe that our framework can achieve the best performance over almost all metrics and benchmarks. By comparing the two different proposal settings (i.e., GSRL and GT), we can find that the accuracy of GSRL is a major bottleneck of the whole framework. Meanwhile, the ablative model (Ours w/o verb) can only achieve slightly better performance than baseline SCT and much worse performance than our full model, which reflects the importance of the verb in semantic structure learning and caption generation. Visualizations. In Figure 5, we illustrate some examples of the generated captions. We can observe that our framework always learns a human-like semantic structure based on the VSR and grounded visual regions (e.g., Arg1thing – sit – Arg2position – LOC – MNR). According to the semantic structures, the captioning model can generate near-perfect descriptions. As a by-product, a well-trained SSP can automatically produce several verb-specific semantic structures for a set of user-interested roles, and we show some examples in Figure 6. For each verb and role set, we illustrate the top two structures by using beam search. Particularly, we are surprised to find that we can even learn some structures that never appear in original datasets (the blue tick ones).","Authors verify their work using a conventions evaluation metrics in prior CIC works. As their quantitative results report in Table 1, you can observe that author's framework can achieve the best performance over almost all metrics and benchmarks. and as for the visualized evaluation, you can observe in Figure 5 that the author's framework always learns a human-like semantic structure based on the VSR and grounded visual regions. and according to the semantic structures, the captioning model can generate near-perfect descriptions.",300,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0001234415504258,0.0187841784209013,0.0,0.0317680351436138,,0.0003384826083169,,0.7855553428493532,0.7352235857042705
273,Are control signals hyper-parameters or not?,"Image captioning, \ie, generating fluent and meaningful descriptions to summarize the salient contents of an image, is a classic proxy task for comprehensive scene understanding [21]. With the release of several large scale datasets and advanced encoder-decoder frameworks, current captioning models plausibly have already achieved “super-human” performance in all accuracy-based evaluation metrics. However, many studies have indicated that these models tend to produce generic descriptions, and fail to control the caption generation process as humans, \eg, referring to different contents of interest or descriptive patterns. In order to endow the captioning models with human-like controllability, a recent surge of efforts [16, 10, 19, 78, 48, 77, 27, 20] resort to introducing extra control signals as constraints of the generated captions, called Controllable Image Captioning (CIC). As a byproduct, the CIC models can easily generate diverse descriptions by feeding different control signals. Given an image \bm{I} and a control signal \mathcal{VSR}, the controllable image captioning model aims to describe \bm{I} by a textual sentence \bm{y}=\{y_{1},...,y_{T}\}, \ie, modeling the probability p(\bm{y}|\bm{I},\mathcal{VSR}). Inspired from the human habit of describing images, we decompose this task into two steps: structuring a descriptive pattern and filling in detailed captions:\displaystyle p(\bm{y}|\bm{I},\mathcal{VSR})=p(\bm{y}|\text{pattern})p(\text{pattern}|\bm{I},\mathcal{VSR}).(2) One of the well-known advantages of controllable image captioning is the ability to generate diverse image captions by feeding different control signals. Thus, we also evaluate the diversity of the captions generated by our framework.","No, as it doesn't affect training, and it's more of an input to model, as you can generate a diversity of captions by feeding the model different control signals.","Common metrics used to evaluate the performance of face recognition systems include:

4. False Negative Identification Rate (FNIR) and False Positive Identification Rate (FPIR) for open-set face identification, as measured by the Decision Error Tradeoff (DET) curve.

274,How are objective control signals more advantageous than subjective control signals when controlling the caption generation process?,"Early CIC works mainly focus on subjective control signals, such as sentiments [41], emotions [42, 22], and personality [14, 54], \ie, the linguistic styles of sentences. Although these stylized captioning models can eventually produce style-related captions, they remain hard to control the generation process effectively and precisely. To further improve the controllability, recent CIC works gradually put a more emphasis on objective control signals. More specifically, they can be coarsely classified into two categories: 1) Content-controlled: the control signals are about the contents of interest which need to be described. As the example shown in Figure 1 (a), given the region set () as a control signal, we hope that the generated caption can cover all regions (\ie, man, wave, and surfboard). So far, various types of content-controlled signals have been proposed, such as visual relations [27], object regions [16, 35], scene graphs [10, 78], and mouse trace [48]. 2) Structure-controlled: the control signals are about the semantic structures of sentences. For instance, the length-level [19], part-of-speech tags [20], or attributes [79] of the sentence (cf. Figure 1 (b)) are some typical structure-controlled signals.",Subjective control signals are harder to control the generation process effectively and precisely.,"These automated metrics for human preferences, such as BERTScore, BLEURT, and summarization preferences, differ in the factors they consider when predicting human preferences.

275,What is the big reason of making difficult to decide whether a control signal is sample-suitable in advance? ,"Nevertheless, all existing objective control signals (\ie, both content-controlled and structure-controlled) have overlooked two indispensable characteristics of an ideal control signal towards “human-like” controllable image captioning: 1) Event-compatible: all visual contents referred to in a single sentence should be compatible with the described activity. Imaging how humans describe images — our brains always quickly structure a descriptive pattern like “sth do sth at someplace” first, and then fill in the detailed description [56, 46, 30, 71], \ie, we have subconsciously made sure that all the mentioned entities are event-compatible (\eg, man, wave, surfboard are all involved in activity riding in Figure 1 (a)). To further see the negative impact of dissatisfying this requirement, suppose that we deliberately utilize two more objects (hand and sky, \ie, ) as part of the control signal, and the model generates an incoherent and illogical caption. 2) Sample-suitable: the control signals should be suitable for the specific image sample. By “suitable”, we mean that there do exist reasonable descriptions satisfying the control signals, \eg, a large length-level may not be suitable for an image with a very simple scene. Unfortunately, it is always very difficult to decide whether a control signal is sample-suitable in advance.

276,What are the metrics used to evaluate the trade-off between the quality and diversity of generated captions?,"Evaluation Metrics. To evaluate the quality of the generated captions, we use five accuracy-based metrics, including BLEU-4 (B4) [45], METEOR (M) [5], ROUGE (R) [34], CIDEr-D (C) [61], and SPICE (S) [2]. Particularly, we evaluate the generated captions against the single ground truth caption. We also propose a new recall-based metric to evaluate whether the roles of the generated sentence are consistent with the ground truth caption (\ie, VSR). It measures the recall rate of the verb, semantic roles, and ordered role pairs, which are denoted as R{}_{\text{V}}, R{}_{\text{SR1}} and R{}_{\text{SR2}}, respectively. Evaluation Metrics. We used two types of metrics to evaluate the diverse captions: 1) Accuracy-based: we followed the conventions of the previous works [16, 20, 65] and reported the best-1 accuracy, \ie, the generated caption with the maximum score for each metric is chosen. Analogously, we evaluate the generated captions against the single ground truth caption. 2) Diversity-based: we followed [10] and used two metrics which only focus on the language similarity: Div-n (D-n) [4, 20] and self-CIDEr (s-C) [66].","Authors used BlEU, METOR, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE to evaluate quality based generated captions, And used Accuracy-based,  Diversity-based metrics to evaluate diversity based generation captions.",No,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4124293785310733,0.9416195856873822,0.0,0.0003998400639744,0.0182902086526155,0.3839330375194549,0.0182903446257114,,0.000222770063829,,0.8305321985647166,0.7340203036940569
277,What are the examples of sub-roles?,"R-level SSP. The role-level (R-level) SSP is a fine-grained structure model which aims to rank all sub-roles within the same semantic role (\eg, LOC-1 and LOC-2 are two sub-roles of role Loc in Figure 3). Since the only differences among these sub-roles are the grounded visual regions, we borrow ideas from the Sinkhorn networks [43, 16], which use a differentiable Sinkhorn operation to learn a soft permutation matrix \bm{P}. Specifically, for each role s_{i} with multiple sub-roles (\ie, n_{i}>1), we first select all the corresponding grounded proposal sets for these sub-roles, denoted as \mathcal{\hat{B}}=\{\mathcal{\hat{B}}_{1},...,\mathcal{\hat{B}}_{n_{i}}\}. And for each proposal \bm{b}_{*}\in\mathcal{\hat{B}}, we encode a feature vector \bm{z}_{*}=[\bm{z}^{v}_{*};\bm{z}^{s_{i}}_{*};\bm{z}^{l}_{*}], where \bm{z}^{v}_{*} is a transformation of its visual feature \bm{f}_{*}, \bm{z}^{s_{i}}_{*} is the word embedding feature of the semantic role s_{i}, and \bm{z}^{l}_{*} is a 4-d encoding of the spatial position of proposal \bm{b}_{*}. Then, we transform each feature \bm{z}_{*} into n_{i}-d, and average-pooled all features among the same proposal set, \ie, we can obtain an n_{i}-d feature for each \mathcal{\hat{B}}_{i}. We concatenate all these features to get an n_{i}\times n_{i} matrix \bm{Z}. Finally, we use the Sinkhorn operation to obtain the soft permutation matrix \bm{P}4:\displaystyle\bm{P}=\text{Sinkhorn}(\bm{Z}).(6)",LOC-1 and LOC-2 in Figure 3.,"Offline RL refers to training a reinforcement learning agent from a pre-existing dataset, without interacting with an online environment",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.698779804868033,2.0240848536510248,0.0,0.0099009900990099,0.0674705505371093,0.1138055699387776,0.0674705654382705,0.1347089856863021,0.0030020990660606,0.0,0.7286040977227634,0.7056361834298395
278,"What does the b of the sub-role, s^b_i mean in the semantic structure of sentence S?","Further, we utilize two sequences \mathcal{S}=(s^{b}_{1},...,s^{b}_{K}) and \mathcal{R}=(\bm{r}_{1},...,\bm{r}_{K}) to model the descriptive patterns. Specifically, \mathcal{S} is a semantic structure of the sentence and each s^{b}_{i}\in\mathcal{S} is a sub-role. By “sub-role”, we mean that each role s_{i}\in\mathcal{VSR} can be divided into n_{i} sub-roles, and when n_{i}=1, role s_{i} itself is a sub-role. Thus, VSR in Figure 3 can be rewritten as Arg0, Arg1, LOC-1, and LOC-2. \mathcal{R} is a sequence of visual features of the corresponding grounded entities for each sub-role in \mathcal{S} (\eg, \bm{r}_{i} is the features of visual regions referring to s^{b}_{i}). Particularly, for presentation conciseness, we regard the verb in \mathcal{VSR} as a special type of sub-role, and since there are no grounded visual regions referring to the verb, we use the global image feature as the grounded region feature in \mathcal{R}. Meanwhile, we use \mathcal{\tilde{R}} to denote a set of all elements in the sequence \mathcal{R}. Thus, we further decompose this task into three components:\displaystyle p(\bm{y}|\bm{I},\mathcal{VSR})=\underbrace{p(\bm{y}|\mathcal{S},\mathcal{R})}_{\text{Captioner}}\underbrace{p(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{R}|\mathcal{\tilde{R}},\mathcal{VSR})}_{\text{SSP}}\underbrace{p(\mathcal{\tilde{R}}|\bm{I},\mathcal{VSR})}_{\text{GSRL}}.(3) Given the semantic structure sequence \mathcal{S}=(s^{b}_{1},...,s^{b}_{K}) and corresponding proposal feature sequence \mathcal{R}=(\bm{r}_{1},...,\bm{r}_{K}), we utilize a two-layer LSTM to generate the final caption \bm{y}. At each time step, the model fouces on one specific sub-role \bm{s}^{b}_{t} and its grounded region set \bm{r}_{t}, and then generates the word y_{t}. Therefore, we take inspirations from previous CIC methods [16, 10], and predict two distributions simultaneously: p(g_{t}|\mathcal{S},\mathcal{R}) for controlling the shift of sub-roles, and p(y_{t}|\mathcal{S},\mathcal{R}) to predict the distribution of a word.","^b refer to a sub-role in the semantic structure of the sentence. as S is the semantic structure of the sentence, i is specific to a number of sub-role of a sequence of sub-roles in the semantic structure of a sentence. and ^b is a general sub-role.","The limitations of DreamBooth include difficulty generating accurate contexts, context-appearance entanglement, overfitting to real images, and variability in fidelity and hallucinated features",0.1860465066306112,0.0,0.1860465066306112,1.0268160753681452,19.51056471467765,16.78966749263957,0.0723140495867768,0.0052108005684509,-0.0055765258148312,0.3739032592909695,0.0768964439630508,0.2342530637979507,0.0028248570867483,,0.6730362603121526,0.7075146126280099
279,"How is N, the number of disjoint sets of proposals determined?","Given an image \bm{I}, we first utilize an object detector [50] to extract a set of object proposals \mathcal{B}. Each proposal \bm{b}_{i}\in\mathcal{B} is associated with a visual feature \bm{f}_{i} and a class label c_{i}\in\mathcal{C}. Then, we group all these proposals into N disjoint sets, \ie, \mathcal{B}=\{\mathcal{B}_{1},...,\mathcal{B}_{N}\}333Due to different annotation natures of specific CIC datasets, we group proposals by different principles. Details are shown in Section 4.2., and each proposal set \mathcal{B}_{i} consists of one or more proposals. In this GSRL step, we need to refer each sub-role in the \mathcal{VSR} to a proposal set in \mathcal{B}. Specifically, we calculate the similarity score a_{ij} between semantic role s_{i} and proposal set \mathcal{B}_{j} by:\displaystyle\bm{q}_{i}=\left[\bm{e}^{g}_{v};\bm{e}^{g}_{s_{i}};\bm{\bar{f}}\right],\quad a_{ij}=F_{a}(\bm{q}_{i},\bm{\bar{f}_{j}}),(4)where \bm{e}^{g}_{v} and \bm{e}^{g}_{s_{i}} are the word embedding features of verb v and semantic role s_{i}, \bm{\bar{f}} and \bm{\bar{f}_{j}} represent the average-pooled visual features of proposal set \mathcal{B} and \mathcal{B}_{j}, [;] is a concatenation operation, and F_{a} is a learnable similarity function444For conciseness, we leave the details in the supplementary material. .

In this paper, we argued that all existing objective control signals for CIC have overlooked two indispensable characteristics: event-compatible and sample-suitable. To this end, we proposed a novel control signal called VSR. VSR consists of a verb and several semantic roles, \ie, all components are guaranteed to be event-compatible. Meanwhile, VSR only restricts the involved semantic roles, which is also sample-suitable for all the images containing the activity. We have validated the effectiveness of VSR through extensive experiments. Moving forward, we will plan to 1) design a more effective captioning model to benefit more from the VSR signals; 2) extend VSR to other controllable text generation tasks, \eg, video captioning [69]; 3) design a more general framework to cover the images without verbs.","Objective control signal, and Objective control singals types are the only type mentioned in this paper. thereby can't give a full answer within this paper information.",Neurologists and radiologists were recruited to annotate the visible lesions.

Weintroduce two important refinements to the pure max-probability based beamsearch algorithm: a coverage penalty [42] and lengthnormalization. With length normalization, we aim to account for thefact that we have to compare hypotheses of different length. Withoutsome form of length-normalization regular beam search will favorshorter results over longer ones on average since a negativelog-probability is added at each step, yielding lower (more negative) scores forlonger sentences. We first tried to simply divideby the length to normalize. We then improved on that original heuristic by dividing bylength^{\alpha}, with 0<\alpha<1 where \alpha is optimized ona development set (\alpha\in[0.6-0.7] was usually found to bebest). Eventually we designed the empirically-better scoring functionbelow, which also includes a coverage penalty to favor translationsthat fully cover the source sentence according to the attentionmodule. \begin{split}s(Y,X)&=\log(P(Y|X))/lp(Y)+cp(X;Y)\\lp(Y)&=\frac{(5+|Y|)^{\alpha}}{(5+1)^{\alpha}}\\cp(X;Y)&=\beta*\sum_{i=1}^{|X|}{\log(\min(\sum_{j=1}^{|Y|}{p_{i,j}},1.0))},\end{split}(14)where p_{i,j} is the attention probability of the j-th target wordy_{j} on the i-th source word x_{i}. By construction(equation 4), \sum_{i=0}^{|X|}{p_{i,j}} is equalto 1. Parameters \alpha and \beta control the strength ofthe length normalization and the coverage penalty. When \alpha=0 and\beta=0, our decoder falls back to pure beam search by probability. We find that length normalization (\alpha) and coverage penalty(\beta) are less effective for models with RLrefinement. Table 3 summarizes ourresults.

282,How can the attention mechanism connecting the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder contribute to improving parallelism?,"Model parallelism places certain constraints on the modelarchitectures we can use. For example, we cannot afford to havebi-directional LSTM layers for all the encoder layers, since doing sowould reduce parallelism among subsequent layers, as each layer wouldhave to wait until both forward and backward directions of the previouslayer have finished. This would effectively constrain us to make use ofonly 2 GPUs in parallel (one for the forward direction and one for thebackward direction). For the attention portion of the model, we chose to align thebottom decoder output to the top encoder output to maximizeparallelism when running the decoder network. Had we aligned the top decoderlayer to the top encoder layer, we would have removed all parallelismin the decoder network and would not benefit from using more than oneGPU for decoding.

The bottom encoder layer is bi-directional: the pink nodes gather information from left to right while the green nodes gather information from right to left. The other layers of the encoder are uni-directional. Residual connections start from the layer third from the bottom in the encoder and decoder. The model is partitioned into multiple GPUs to speed up training. In our setup, we have 8 encoder LSTM layers (1 bi-directional layer and 7 uni-directional layers), and 8 decoder layers. With this setting, one model replica is partitioned 8-ways and is placed on 8 different GPUs typically belonging to one host machine. During training, the bottom bi-directional encoder layers compute in parallel first. Once both finish, the uni-directional encoder layers can start computing, each on a separate GPU. To retain as much parallelism as possible during running the decoder layers, we use the bottom decoder layer output only for obtaining recurrent attention context, which is sent directly to all the remaining decoder layers. The softmax layer is also partitioned and placed on multiple GPUs. Depending on the output vocabulary size we either have them run on the same GPUs as the encoder and decoder networks, or have them run on a separate set of dedicated GPUs.","First we have to establish that LSTM layers reduces parallelism as each layer would have to wait until both forward and backward directions of the previous layer to finish.

284,What are the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems compared to neural machine translation? ,"Neural Machine Translation(NMT) [41, 2] has recently beenintroduced as a promising approach with the potential of addressingmany shortcomings of traditional machine translation systems.The strength of NMT lies in its ability to learn directly, in anend-to-end fashion, the mapping from input text to associated output text.Its architecture typically consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNNs), oneto consume the input text sequence and one to generate translated output text.NMT is often accompanied by an attention mechanism [2]which helps it cope effectively with long input sequences. An advantage of Neural Machine Translation is that it sidesteps manybrittle design choices in traditional phrase-based machinetranslation [26]. In practice, however, NMT systemsused to be worse in accuracy than phrase-based translation systems,especially when training on very large-scale datasets as used for the verybest publicly available translation systems.Three inherent weaknesses of Neural Machine Translation are responsible for thisgap: its slower training and inference speed, ineffectiveness in dealing withrare words, and sometimesfailure to translate all words in the source sentence. Firstly, it generallytakes a considerable amount of time and computational resources totrain an NMT system on a large-scale translation dataset, thus slowing the rateof experimental turnaround time and innovation. For inference they are generallymuch slower than phrase-based systems due to the large number of parametersused.Secondly, NMT lacks robustness in translating rare words. Though thiscan be addressed in principle by training a “copy model” to mimic atraditional alignment model [31], or by using theattention mechanism to copy rare words [37], these approaches areboth unreliable at scale, since the quality of the alignments varies acrosslanguages, and the latent alignments produced by the attentionmechanism are unstable when the network is deep. Also, simple copyingmay not always be the best strategy to cope with rare words, for example whena transliteration is more appropriate. Finally,NMT systems sometimes produce output sentencesthat do not translate all parts of the input sentence – in otherwords, they fail to completely “cover” the input, which can result insurprising translations. Since then, many novel techniques have been proposed to furtherimprove NMT: using an attention mechanism to deal with rarewords [37], a mechanism to model translationcoverage [42], multi-task and semi-supervised training toincorporate more data [14, 29], a characterdecoder [9], a characterencoder [11], subwordunits [38] also to deal with rare word outputs,different kinds of attentionmechanisms [30], and sentence-levelloss minimization [39, 34].While the translation accuracy of these systems has been encouraging, systematiccomparison with large scale, production quality phrase-based translation systemshas been lacking.","The weakness of conventional phrase-based translation systems over Neural Machine Translation are their brittle design choices especially when it's trained on very large-scale datasets, large scale, production quality and it lacks the ability to learn directly in an end-to-end fashion.","Sure!

285,What are the roles of attention connections from the decoder network to the encoder?,"This work presents the design and implementation of GNMT, a production NMTsystem at Google, that aims toprovide solutions to the above problems. In our implementation, therecurrent networks are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)RNNs [23, 17]. Our LSTM RNNs have 8layers, with residual connections between layers to encourage gradientflow [21]. For parallelism, we connect the attention fromthe bottom layer of the decoder network to the top layer of theencoder network. To improve inference time, we employ low-precisionarithmetic for inference, which is further accelerated by specialhardware (Google’s Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU). To effectivelydeal with rare words, we use sub-word units (also known as“wordpieces”) [35] for inputs and outputs inour system. Using wordpieces gives a good balance between theflexibility of single characters and the efficiency of full words fordecoding, and also sidesteps the need for special treatment of unknownwords. Our beam search technique includes a length normalization procedure todeal efficiently with the problem of comparing hypotheses of differentlengths during decoding, and a coverage penalty to encourage the modelto translate all of the provided input. Our model (see Figure 1) follows the commonsequence-to-sequence learning framework [41] withattention [2]. It has three components:an encoder network, a decoder network, and an attention network. Theencoder transforms a source sentence into a list of vectors, one vector per input symbol. Giventhis list of vectors, the decoder produces one symbol at a time, untilthe special end-of-sentence symbol (EOS) is produced. The encoder and decoderare connected through an attention module which allows the decoder tofocus on different regions of the source sentence during the course ofdecoding. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder.",Attentions connections improve parallelism allowing to decrease training time and allows the decoder to focus on different regions of the source sentence.,"Consistency in key signature.

286,How is “character”-delimited models different from “word”-delimited models?,"A second approach we use is the mixed word/character model.As in a word model, we keep a fixed-size word vocabulary.However, unlike in a conventional word model where OOV words are collapsedinto a single UNK symbol, we convert OOV words into the sequence of itsconstituent characters.Special prefixes are prepended to the characters, to 1) show the location ofthe characters in a word, and 2) to distinguish them from normal in-vocabularycharacters. There are threeprefixes: <B>,<M>, and <E>, indicating beginning of the word, middleof the word and end of the word, respectively. For example, let’s assume theword Miki is not in the vocabulary. It will be preprocessed into asequence of special tokens: <B>M <M>i <M>k <E>i. The process isdone on both the source and the target sentences. During decoding, theoutput may also contain sequences of special tokens. With theprefixes, it is trivial to reverse the tokenization to the original words aspart of a post-processing step. The mixed word-character model is similar to the word model, except theout-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are converted into sequences ofcharacters with special delimiters around them as described in section4.2 in more detail. Inour experiments, the vocabulary size for the mixed word-charactermodel is 32K. For the pure character model, we simply split all wordsinto constituent characters, resulting typically in a few hundred basiccharacters (including special symbols appearing in the data). For thewordpiece models, we train 3 different models with vocabulary sizes of8K, 16K, and 32K. The pure character model (char input, char output) works surprisinglywell on this task, not much worse than the best wordpiece models in BLEUscore.

289,"Is there a disadvantage to using low-precision arithmetic for inference, such as decreased inference accuracy?","In this section, we present our approach to speed up inference withquantized arithmetic. Our solution is tailored towards the hardwareoptions available at Google. To reduce quantization errors, additionalconstraints are added to our model during training so that it is quantizablewith minimal impact on the output of the model. That is, once amodel is trained with these additional constraints, it can be subsequentlyquantized without loss to translation quality. Our experimental results suggestthat those additional constraints do not hurt model convergence nor the qualityof a model once it has converged. It is worth emphasizing that during training of the model we use full-precisionfloating point numbers. The only constraints we add to the modelduring training are the clipping of the RNN accumulator values into[-\delta,\delta] and softmax logits into[-\gamma,\gamma]. \gamma is fixed to be at 25.0, while thevalue for \delta is gradually annealed from a generous bound of\delta=8.0 at the beginning of training, to a rather stringent boundof \delta=1.0 towards the end of training. At inference time,\delta is fixed at 1.0. Those additional constraints do not degrademodel convergence nor the decoding quality of the model when it hasconverged. In Figure 4, we compare the lossvs. steps for an unconstrained model (the blue curve) and a constrainedmodel (the red curve) on WMT’14 English-to-French. We can see thatthe loss for the constrained model is slightly better, possibly due toregularization roles those constraints play. Our solution strikes a good balance between efficiency andaccuracy. Since the computationally expensive operations (the matrixmultiplications) are done using 8-bit integer operations, ourquantized inference is quite efficient. Also, since error-sensitiveaccumulator values are stored using 16-bit integers, our solution isvery accurate and is robust to quantization errors.

291,"In the model architecture described in this paper, how many residual connections are used?","This work presents the design and implementation of GNMT, a production NMTsystem at Google, that aims toprovide solutions to the above problems. In our implementation, therecurrent networks are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)RNNs [23, 17]. Our LSTM RNNs have 8layers, with residual connections between layers to encourage gradientflow [21]. For parallelism, we connect the attention fromthe bottom layer of the decoder network to the top layer of theencoder network. To improve inference time, we employ low-precisionarithmetic for inference, which is further accelerated by specialhardware (Google’s Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU). To effectivelydeal with rare words, we use sub-word units (also known as“wordpieces”) [35] for inputs and outputs inour system. Using wordpieces gives a good balance between theflexibility of single characters and the efficiency of full words fordecoding, and also sidesteps the need for special treatment of unknownwords. Our beam search technique includes a length normalization procedure todeal efficiently with the problem of comparing hypotheses of differentlengths during decoding, and a coverage penalty to encourage the modelto translate all of the provided input. \begin{split}\mathbf{c}_{t}^{i},\mathbf{m}_{t}^{i}&=\mathrm{LSTM}_{i}(\mathbf{c}_{t-1}^{i},\mathbf{m}_{t-1}^{i},\mathbf{x}_{t}^{i-1};\mathbf{W}^{i})\\\mathbf{x}_{t}^{i}&=\mathbf{m}_{t}^{i}+\mathbf{x}_{t}^{i-1}\\\mathbf{c}_{t}^{i+1},\mathbf{m}_{t}^{i+1}&=\mathrm{LSTM}_{i+1}(\mathbf{c}_{t-1}^{i+1},\mathbf{m}_{t-1}^{i+1},\mathbf{x}_{t}^{i};\mathbf{W}^{i+1})\end{split}(6)Residual connections greatly improve the gradient flow in the backwardpass, which allows us to train very deep encoder and decodernetworks. In most of our experiments, we use 8 LSTM layers for the encoderand decoder, though residual connections can allow us to trainsubstantially deeper networks (similar to what was observedin [45]). In all experiments, our models consist of 8 encoder layers and 8 decoder layers.(Since the bottom encoder layer is actually bi-directional, in total there are9 logically distinct LSTM passes in the encoder.)The attention network is a simple feedforward network with one hidden layer with 1024 nodes.All of the models use 1024 LSTM nodes per encoder and decoder layers.","Authors used 8 LSTM layers for the encoder, and 8 LSTM layers for the decoder with residual connections for both networks, each layer has 1024 node. though it's not very clear how many residual connections are but a possible answer is 16384.",YES,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7861635220125787,0.5896226415094339,0.0,0.000238038562247,0.0320410951972007,0.5045523643493652,0.0731384381651878,,0.0001580942259474,0.0,0.7444427890887463,0.7005100294062448

293,Why is there a larger number of basic characters used for Asian languages than for Western languages?,"The wordpiece model is generated using a data-driven approach tomaximize the language-model likelihood of the training data, given anevolving word definition. Given a training corpus and a number ofdesired tokens D, the optimization problem is to select Dwordpieces such that the resulting corpus is minimal in the number ofwordpieces when segmented according to the chosen wordpiece model. Ourgreedy algorithm to this optimization problem is similarto [38] and is described in more detail in[35]. Compared to the original implementation used in[35], we use a special symbol only at thebeginning of the words and not at both ends. We also cut the numberof basic characters to a manageable number depending on the data(roughly 500 for Western languages, more for Asian languages) and mapthe rest to a special unknown character to avoid polluting the givenwordpiece vocabulary with very rare characters. We find that using a total vocabulary of between 8k and 32k wordpieces achievesboth good accuracy (BLEU scores) and fast decodingspeed across all pairs of language pairs we have tried.","The number of basic characters depends on the data, and the answer to this question is not within the limit of this paper.","A 'good' initial parameter would be one that is sensitive to changes in the task, such that small changes in the parameters lead to large improvements on the loss function of any task drawn from p(T)",0.2040816279050396,0.036363631563637,0.1224489748438152,2.3380181004272496,19.49358442221469,17.73851749545176,0.150375939849624,0.0111248454882571,0.0942536070942878,0.408214102672027,0.0942538604140281,0.4423384964466095,0.0096341033701657,,0.7265671420281764,0.742399344309504
294,Does the task reward function in this context mean the translation task-related reward function?,"Given a dataset of parallel text containing N input-output sequencepairs, denoted \mathcal{D}\equiv\left\{(X^{(i)},Y^{*(i)})\right\}_{i=1}^{N},standard maximum-likelihood training aims at maximizing the sum of logprobabilities of the ground-truth outputs given the correspondinginputs,\mathcal{O}_{\mathrm{ML}}(\bm{\mathbf{\theta}})=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\log{P}_{\theta}(Y^{*(i)}\mid X^{(i)})~{}.(7)The main problem with this objective is that it does not reflect thetask reward function as measured by the BLEU score in translation. Further,this objective does not explicitly encourage a ranking among incorrectoutput sequences – where outputs with higher BLEU scores should still obtainhigher probabilities under the model – since incorrect outputs are neverobserved during training. In other words, using maximum-likelihoodtraining only, the model will not learn to be robust to errors made duringdecoding since they are never observed, which is quite a mismatch betweenthe training and testing procedure.","Yes, author's concerns are translation tasks.","Attention Function is a mechanism that computes a weighted sum of values based on the compatibility between a query and a set of key-value pairs.

295,Is the \delta a hyper-parameter?,"Recall from equation 6 that in an LSTM stackwith residual connections there are two accumulators: \mathbf{c}_{t}^{i}along the time axis and \mathbf{x}_{t}^{i} along the depth axis. Intheory, both of the accumulators are unbounded, but in practice, wenoticed their values remain quite small. For quantized inference, weexplicitly constrain the values of these accumulators to be within[-\delta, \delta] to guarantee a certain range that can be used forquantization later. The forward computation of an LSTM stack withresidual connections is modified to the following: \begin{split}\mathbf{v_{t}}&=\mathbf{W_{s}}*\mathbf{y_{t}}\\\mathbf{v_{t}^{\prime}}&=\max(-\gamma,\min(\gamma,\mathbf{v_{t}}))\\\mathbf{p_{t}}&=softmax(\mathbf{v_{t}^{\prime}})\end{split}(13)In equation 13, \mathbf{W_{s}} is the weightmatrix for the linear layer, which has the same number of rows as thenumber of symbols in the target vocabulary with each row correspondingto one unique target symbol. \mathbf{v} represents the raw logits, which arefirst clipped to be between -\gamma and \gamma and then normalizedinto a probability vector \mathbf{p}. Input \mathbf{y_{t}} isguaranteed to be between -\delta and \delta due to thequantization scheme we applied to the decoder RNN. The clipping range\gamma for the logits \mathbf{v} is determined empirically, and inour case, it is set to 25. In quantized inference, the weight matrix\mathbf{W_{s}} is quantized into 8 bits as inequation 12, and the matrix multiplication is done using8 bit arithmetic. The calculations within the softmax function and theattention model are not quantized during inference. It is worth emphasizing that during training of the model we use full-precisionfloating point numbers. The only constraints we add to the modelduring training are the clipping of the RNN accumulator values into[-\delta,\delta] and softmax logits into[-\gamma,\gamma]. \gamma is fixed to be at 25.0, while thevalue for \delta is gradually annealed from a generous bound of\delta=8.0 at the beginning of training, to a rather stringent boundof \delta=1.0 towards the end of training.

This means the model does not have to explicitly store gigantic phrase tables and language models as in the case of standard MT; hence, NMT has a small memory footprint. Lastly, implementing NMT decoders is easy unlike the highly intricate decoders in standard MT [Koehn et al., 2003].","Large Neural network NMT has the ability to generalize well to very long word sequences so that it doesn't have to store gigantic phrase tables and language models, which results to having a small memory footprint.",To ensure diverse transformations and minimize redundancy between local transformations,0.0476190442517009,0.0,0.0476190442517009,0.969094302009921,20.800804084662424,16.447344635281482,0.0277008310249307,0.002932551319648,0.1048027202486991,0.4068400316970525,0.1048026829957962,0.1831906139850616,0.000489707777418,0.0,0.8148218885397401,0.7528736255839003
299,What are the pros and cons of a global approach and a local approach?,"The global attention has a drawback that it has to attend to all words on thesource side for each target word, which is expensive and can potentially render it impractical totranslate longer sequences, e.g., paragraphs or documents.To address this deficiency, we propose a local attentional mechanism thatchooses to focus only on a small subset of the source positions per target word. Our local attention mechanism selectively focuses on a small window ofcontext and is differentiable. This approach has an advantage of avoiding the expensive computation incurred inthe soft attention and at the same time, is easier to train than the hardattention approach.In concrete details, the model first generates an aligned position p_{t} for each target word at time t. Thecontext vector \mbox{\boldmath{$c$}}_{t} is then derived as a weighted average over the set of source hidden states within the window [p_{t}-D,p_{t}+D]; D isempirically selected.888If the window crosses the sentence boundaries, wesimply ignore the outside part and consider words in the window. Unlike the global approach, the local alignment vector \mbox{\boldmath{$a$}}_{t} is now fixed-dimensional, i.e., \in\mathbb{R}^{2D+1}. We consider two variants of the model as below. In this work, we design, with simplicity and effectiveness in mind, two noveltypes of attention-based models: a global approach in which all sourcewords are attended and a local one whereby only a subset of source wordsare considered at a time. The former approach resembles the model of[Bahdanau et al., 2015] but is simpler architecturally. The latter can be viewed as aninteresting blend between the hard and soft attention modelsproposed in [Xu et al., 2015]: it is computationally less expensive than theglobal model or the soft attention; at the same time, unlike the hard attention,the local attention isdifferentiable almost everywhere, making it easier to implement andtrain.222There is a recent work by ?), which is verysimilar to our local attention and applied to the image generation task.However, as we detail later, our model is much simpler and can achieve good performance for NMT. Besides, we also examine variousalignment functions for our attention-based models. As shown in Table 1, we achieve progressive improvements when(a) reversing the source sentence, +1.3 BLEU, as proposed in [Sutskever et al., 2014]and (b) using dropout, +1.4 BLEU. On top of that, (c) the globalattention approach gives a significant boost of +2.8 BLEU, makingour model slightly better than the base attentional system of?) (row RNNSearch). When (d) using the input-feedingapproach, we seize another notable gain of +1.3 BLEU and outperform theirsystem. The local attention model with predictive alignments (row local-p) provesto be even better, giving us a further improvement of +0.9 BLEU on top of theglobal attention model.It is interesting to observe the trend previously reported in[Luong et al., 2015] that perplexity strongly correlates with translation quality.In total, we achieve a significant gain of5.0 BLEU points over the non-attentional baseline, which already includesknown techniques such as source reversing and dropout. We also found that the alignments produced by local attention models achievelower AERs than those of the global one. The AER obtained by the ensemble, whilegood, is not better than the local-m AER, suggesting the well-knownobservation that AER and translation scores are not well correlated [Fraser and Marcu, 2007].We show some alignment visualizations in Appendix A.","A drawback of the global attention is it had to attend to all words on the source side for each target word, which is expensive and potentially will render it impractical to translate longer sequences, and despite that global attention gives a significant boost of +2.8 BLEU making it better than the base attention system, but the local approach gave further improvement of +0.9 BLEU on top of the global attention model.

301,What kinds of alignment functions are used for their attention-based models?,"We examine different attention models (global, local-m, local-p) and differentalignment functions (location, dot, general, concat) as described inSection 3. Due to limitedresources, we cannot run all the possible combinations.However, results in Table 4 do give us some idea aboutdifferent choices.The location-based function does not learn goodalignments: the global (location) model can only obtain a smallgain when performing unknown word replacement compared to using other alignmentfunctions.141414There is a subtle difference in how we retrieve alignmentsfor the different alignment functions.

319,"Can the number of frames be extended to more than 16? If exists, what is the upper bound for the number of frames?","In order to expand the two-dimensional (2D) conditional network into the temporal dimension, we modify the two key building blocks that now require not just spatial but also temporal dimensions in order to generate videos: (i) Convolutional layers (Sec. 3.2.1), and (ii) attention layers (Sec. 3.2.2), discussed in the following two subsections. Other layers, such as fully-connected layers, do not require specific handling when adding an additional dimension, as they are agnostic to structured spatial and temporal information.Temporal modifications are made in most U-Net-based diffusion networks: the spatiotemporal decoder \operatorname{D^{t}} now generating 16 RGB frames, each of size 64\times 64, the newly added frame interpolation network \uparrow_{F}, increasing the effective frame rate by interpolating between the 16 generated frames (as depicted in Fig. 2), and the super-resolution networks \operatorname{SR}_{l}^{t}. Frame rate conditioning. In addition to the T2I conditionings, similar to CogVideo (Hong et al., 2022), we add an additional conditioning parameter fps, representing the number of frames-per-second in a generated video. Conditioning on a varying number of frames-per-second, enables an additional augmentation method to tackle the limited volume of available videos at training time, and provides additional control on the generated video at inference time. In addition to the spatiotemporal modifications discussed in Sec. 3.2, we train a new masked frame interpolation and extrapolation network \uparrow_{F}, capable of increasing the number of frames of the generated video either by frame interpolation for a smoother generated video, or by pre/post frame extrapolation for extending the video length.In order to increase the frame rate within memory and compute constraints, wefine-tune a spatiotemporal decoder \operatorname{D^{t}} on the task of masked frame interpolation, by zero-padding the masked input frames, enabling video upsampling. When fine-tuning on masked frame interpolation, we add an additional 4 channels to the input of the U-Net: 3 channels for the RGB masked video input and an additional binary channel indicating which frames are masked. We fine-tune with variable frame-skips and fps conditioning to enable multiple temporal upsample rates at inference time. We denote \uparrow_{F} as the operator that expands the given video tensor through masked frame interpolation. For all of our experiments we applied \uparrow_{F} with frame skip 5 to upsample a 16 frame video to 76 frames ((16-1)\times5+1). Note that we can use the same architecture for video extrapolation or image animation by masking frames at the beginning or end of a video. Using function-preserving transformations, we extend the spatial layers at the model initialization stage, to include temporal information.The extended spatial-temporal network includes new attention modules that learn temporal world dynamics from a collection of videos. This procedure significantly accelerates the T2V training process by instantaneously transferring the knowledge from a previously trained T2I network to a new T2V one. To enhance the visual quality, we train spatial super-resolution models as well as frame interpolation models.

I guess it could make the network heavier.,"In order to expand the two-dimensional (2D) conditional network into the temporal dimension, we modify the two key building blocks that now require not just spatial but also temporal dimensions in order to generate videos: (i) Convolutional layers (Sec. 3.2.1), and (ii) attention layers (Sec. 3.2.2), discussed in the following two subsections. Other layers, such as fully-connected layers, do not require specific handling when adding an additional dimension, as they are agnostic to structured spatial and temporal information.Temporal modifications are made in most U-Net-based diffusion networks: the spatiotemporal decoder \operatorname{D^{t}} now generating 16 RGB frames, each of size 64\times 64, the newly added frame interpolation network \uparrow_{F}, increasing the effective frame rate by interpolating between the 16 generated frames (as depicted in Fig. 2), and the super-resolution networks \operatorname{SR}_{l}^{t}. A crucial component of T2I networks is the attention layer, where in addition to self-attending to extracted features, text information is injected to several network hierarchies, alongside other relevant information, such as the diffusion time-step. While using 3D convolutional layers is computationally heavy, adding the temporal dimension to attention layers is outright infeasible in terms of memory consumption.Inspired by the work of (Ho et al., 2022), we extend our dimension decomposition strategy to attention layers as well. Following each (pre-trained) spatial attention layer, we stack a temporal attention layer, whichas with the convolutional layers, approximates a full spatiotemporal attention layer. Specifically, given an input tensor h, we define flatten as a matrix operator that flattens the spatial dimension into h^{\prime}\in R^{B\times C\times F\times HW}. unflatten is defined as the inverse matrix operator. The Pseudo-3D attention layer therefore is therefore defined as: Factorized space-time attention layers have also been used in VDM (Ho et al., 2022) and CogVideo (Hong et al., 2022). CogVideo has added temporal layers to each (frozen) spatial layers whereas we train them jointly. In order to force their network to train for images and videos interchangeably, VDM has extended their 2D U-Net to 3D through unflattened 1x3x3 convolution filters, such that the subsequent spatial attention remains 2D, and added 1D temporal attention through relative position embeddings. In contrast, we apply an additional 3x1x1 convolution projection (after each 1x3x3) such that the temporal information will also be passed through each convolution layer. Using function-preserving transformations, we extend the spatial layers at the model initialization stage, to include temporal information.The extended spatial-temporal network includes new attention modules that learn temporal world dynamics from a collection of videos. This procedure significantly accelerates the T2V training process by instantaneously transferring the knowledge from a previously trained T2I network to a new T2V one. To enhance the visual quality, we train spatial super-resolution models as well as frame interpolation models. This increases the resolution of the generated videos, as well as enables a higher (controllable) frame rate. Make-A-Video differs from previous works in several aspects. First, our architecture breaks the dependency on text-video pairs for T2V generation.This is a significant advantage compared to prior work, that has to be restricted to narrow domains (Mittal et al., 2017; Gupta et al., 2018; Ge et al., 2022; Hayes et al., 2022), or require large-scale paired text-video data (Hong et al., 2022; Ho et al., 2022).Second, we fine-tune the T2I model for video generation, gaining the advantage of adapting the model weights effectively, compared to freezing the weights as in CogVideo (Hong et al., 2022).Third, motivated from prior work on efficient architectures for video and 3D vision tasks (Ye et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018), our use of pseudo-3D convolution (Qiu et al., 2017) and temporal attention layers not only better leverage a T2I architecture, it also allows for better temporal information fusion compared to VDM (Ho et al., 2022).","They extend the spatial layers at the model initialization stage, to include temporal information, and the extended spatial-temporal network learn significantly accelerates the T2V training process by instantaneously transferring the knowledge

Here are two techniques for employing CNNs in medical image analysis, based on the provided context:

322,How can this prevent flickering artifacts? Any backup publications for further explanation?,"Note that super resolution involves hallucinating information. In order to not have flickering artifacts, the hallucination must be consistent across frames. As a result, our \operatorname{SR}_{l}^{t} module operates across spatial and temporal dimensions. In qualitative inspection we found this to significantly outperform per-frame super resolution. It is challenging to extend \operatorname{SR}_{h} to the temporal dimension due to memory and compute constraints, as well as a scarcity of high resolution video data. So \operatorname{SR}_{h} operates only along the spatial dimensions. But to encourage consistent detail hallucination across frames, we use the same noise initialization for each frame. As a next step we plan to address several of the technical limitations. As discussed earlier, our approach can not learn associations between text and phenomenon that can only be inferred in videos. How to incorporate these (e.g., generating a video of a person waving their hand left-to-right or right-to-left), along with generating longer videos, with multiple scenes and events, depicting more detailed stories, is left for future work.","To prevent flickering artifacts, they sustain hallucinating information to be consistent across frames.

323,"Does this bring better performance? If so, what is the reasoning for this?","Clearly, text describing images does not capture the entirety of phenomena observed in videos. That said, one can often infer actions and events from static images (e.g. a woman drinking coffee, or an elephant kicking a football) as done in image-based action recognition systems (Girish et al., 2020). Moreover, even without text descriptions, unsupervised videos are sufficient to learn how different entities in the world move and interact (e.g. the motion of waves at the beach, or of an elephant’s trunk). As a result, a model that has only seen text describing images is surprisingly effective at generating short videos, as demonstrated by our temporal diffusion-based method. Make-A-Video sets the new state-of-the-art in T2V generation. Frame rate conditioning. In addition to the T2I conditionings, similar to CogVideo (Hong et al., 2022), we add an additional conditioning parameter fps, representing the number of frames-per-second in a generated video. Conditioning on a varying number of frames-per-second, enables an additional augmentation method to tackle the limited volume of available videos at training time, and provides additional control on the generated video at inference time. Automatic Evaluation on MSR-VTT. In addition to GODIVA and NÜWA that report on MSR-VTT, we also perform inference on the officially released CogVideo model with both Chinese and English inputs for comparison. For CogVideo and Make-A-Video, we only generate one sample for each prompt in a zero-shot setting. We only generate videos that are at 16\times 256\times 256 as the evaluation models do not expect higher resolutions and frame rate.The results are shown in Table 1. Make-A-Video’s zero-shot performance is much better than GODIVA and NÜWA which are trained on MSR-VTT. We also outperform CogVideo in both Chinese and English settings. Thus, Make-A-Video has significantly better generalization capabilities than prior work. Automatic Evaluation on UCF-101. UCF-101 is a popular benchmark to evaluate video generation and has been recently used in T2V models. CogVideo performed finetuning of their pretrained model for class-conditional video generation. VDM (Ho et al., 2022) performed unconditional video generation and trained from scratch on UCF-101. We argue that both settings are not ideal and is not a direct evaluation of the T2V generation capabilities. Moreover, the FVD evaluation model expects the videos to be 0.5 second (16 frames), which is too short to be used for video generation in practice. Nevertheless, in order to compare to prior work, we conducted evaluation on UCF-101 in both zero-shot and finetuning settings.As shown in Table 2, Make-A-Video’s zero-shot performance is already competitive than other approaches that are trained on UCF-101, and is much better than CogVideo, which indicates that Make-A-Video can generalize better even to such a specific domain. Our finetuning setting achieves state-of-the-art results with a significant reduction in FVD, which suggests that Make-A-Video can generate more coherent videos than prior work. Human Evaluation.We compare to CogVideo (the only public zero-shot T2V generation model) on DrawBench and our test set. We also evaluate on the 28 videos shown on the webpage of VDM (Ho et al., 2022) (which may be biased towards showcasing the model’s strengths). Since this is a very small test set, we randomly generate 8 videos for each input and perform evaluation 8 times and report the average results.We generate videos at 76\times 256\times 256 resolution for human evaluation.The results are shown in Table 3. Make-A-Video achieves much better performance in both video quality and text-video faithfulness in all benchmarks and comparisons. For CogVideo, the results are similar on DrawBench and our evaluation set. For VDM, it is worth noting that we have achieved significantly better resultswithout any cherry-picking.We also evaluate our frame interpolation network in comparison to FILM (Reda et al., 2022). We first generate low frame rate videos (1 FPS) from text prompts in DrawBench and our evaluation set, then use each method to upsample to 4 FPS. Raters choose our method for more realistic motion 62% of the time on our evaluation set and 54% of the time on DrawBench. We observe that our method excels when there are large differences between frames where having real-world knowledge of how objects move is crucial. Our main contributions are:•We present Make-A-Video – an effective method that extends a diffusion-based T2I model to T2V through a spatiotemporally factorized diffusion model.•We leverage joint text-image priors to bypass the need for paired text-video data, which in turn allows us to potentially scale to larger quantities of video data.•We present super-resolution strategies in space and time that, for the first time, generate high-definition, high frame-rate videos given a user-provided textual input.•We evaluate Make-A-Video against existing T2V systems and present: (a) State-of-the-art results in quantitative as well as qualitative measures, and (b) A more thorough evaluation than existing literature in T2V. We also collect a test set of 300 prompts for zero-shot T2V human evaluation which we plan to release. Make-A-Video differs from previous works in several aspects. First, our architecture breaks the dependency on text-video pairs for T2V generation.This is a significant advantage compared to prior work, that has to be restricted to narrow domains (Mittal et al., 2017; Gupta et al., 2018; Ge et al., 2022; Hayes et al., 2022), or require large-scale paired text-video data (Hong et al., 2022; Ho et al., 2022).Second, we fine-tune the T2I model for video generation, gaining the advantage of adapting the model weights effectively, compared to freezing the weights as in CogVideo (Hong et al., 2022).Third, motivated from prior work on efficient architectures for video and 3D vision tasks (Ye et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018), our use of pseudo-3D convolution (Qiu et al., 2017) and temporal attention layers not only better leverage a T2I architecture, it also allows for better temporal information fusion compared to VDM (Ho et al., 2022).","In the limited volume of available videos at training time, conditioning on a varying number of frames-per-second, enables an additional augmentation method, and provides rovides additional control on the generated video at inference time.

It is observed that this method excels when there are large differences between frames where having real-world knowledge of how objects move is crucial.

In training the decoder, it is common to initialize the input embeddings with negative infinity values, as you mentioned. However, as training progresses, these inputs should be updated based on the generated output symbols. This is because the decoder's output is used as input to the encoder, which in turn affects the decoder's input.

Did the authors remove such cases prior to running the evaluation?","Inspired by these motivations, we propose Make-A-Video. Make-A-Video leverages T2I models to learn the correspondence between text and the visual world, and uses unsupervised learning on unlabeled (unpaired) video data, to learn realistic motion. Together, Make-A-Video generates videos from text without leveraging paired text-video data. Clearly, text describing images does not capture the entirety of phenomena observed in videos.

For faithfulness, we additionally show the text and ask annotators which video has a better correspondence with the text (we suggest them to ignore quality issues). In addition, we also conducted human evaluation to compare video motion realism of our interpolation model and FILM (Reda et al., 2022).For each comparison, we use the majority vote from 5 different annotators as the final result. As with all large-scale models trained on data from the web, our models have learnt and likely exaggerated social biases, including harmful ones.

Learning world dynamics from orders of magnitude more videos using unsupervised learning helps researchers break away from the reliance on labeled data. The presented work has shown how labeled images combined effectively with unlabeled video footage can achieve that. As a next step we plan to address several of the technical limitations. As discussed earlier, our approach can not learn associations between text and phenomenon that can only be inferred in videos.

Text-to-Video Generation.While there is remarkable progress in T2I generation, the progress of T2V generation lags behind largely due to two main reasons: the lack of large-scale datasets with high-quality text-video pairs, and the complexity of modeling higher-dimensional video data. Early works (Mittal et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Marwah et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Gupta et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019b) are mainly focused on video generation in simple domains, such as moving digits or specific human actions. To our knowledge, Sync-DRAW (Mittal et al., 2017) is the first T2V generation approach that leverages a VAE with recurrent attention. (Pan et al., 2017) and (Li et al., 2018) extend GANs from image generation to T2V generation.","Unsupervised learning enables networks to learn from orders of magnitude more data.

330,Does lower FVD value mean more coherent generation? What is a coherent video in the first place?,"Automatic Evaluation on UCF-101. UCF-101 is a popular benchmark to evaluate video generation and has been recently used in T2V models. CogVideo performed finetuning of their pretrained model for class-conditional video generation. VDM (Ho et al., 2022) performed unconditional video generation and trained from scratch on UCF-101. We argue that both settings are not ideal and is not a direct evaluation of the T2V generation capabilities. Moreover, the FVD evaluation model expects the videos to be 0.5 second (16 frames), which is too short to be used for video generation in practice. Nevertheless, in order to compare to prior work, we conducted evaluation on UCF-101 in both zero-shot and finetuning settings.As shown in Table 2, Make-A-Video’s zero-shot performance is already competitive than other approaches that are trained on UCF-101, and is much better than CogVideo, which indicates that Make-A-Video can generalize better even to such a specific domain. Our finetuning setting achieves state-of-the-art results with a significant reduction in FVD, which suggests that Make-A-Video can generate more coherent videos than prior work.

332,I believe T2I models can do this using latent exploration. What is the difference between them? What is novel about T2V’s interpolation?,"Make-A-Video consists of three main components: (i) A base T2I model trained on text-image pairs (Sec. 3.1), (ii) spatiotemporal convolution and attention layers that extend the networks’ building blocks to the temporal dimension (Sec. 3.2), and (iii) spatiotemporal networks that consist of both spatiotemporal layers, as well as another crucial element needed for T2V generation - a frame interpolation network for high frame rate generation (Sec. 3.3). Using function-preserving transformations, we extend the spatial layers at the model initialization stage, to include temporal information.The extended spatial-temporal network includes new attention modules that learn temporal world dynamics from a collection of videos. This procedure significantly accelerates the T2V training process by instantaneously transferring the knowledge from a previously trained T2I network to a new T2V one. To enhance the visual quality, we train spatial super-resolution models as well as frame interpolation models. This increases the resolution of the generated videos, as well as enables a higher (controllable) frame rate. Examples of Make-A-Video’s generations are shown in Figure 1. In this section, we will show T2V generation comparison to CogVideo (Hong et al., 2022) and VDM (Ho et al., 2022), and video interpolation comparison to FILM (Reda et al., 2022).In addition, our models can be used for a variety of other tasks such as image animation, video variation, etc. Due to space constraint, we only show a single example of each.Figure 4 (a) shows the comparison of Make-A-Video to CogVideo and VDM.

333,Is there any other method to do this instead of simply averaging the values out? There can be a smarter way to do this.,"Note that super resolution involves hallucinating information. In order to not have flickering artifacts, the hallucination must be consistent across frames. As a result, our \operatorname{SR}_{l}^{t} module operates across spatial and temporal dimensions. In qualitative inspection we found this to significantly outperform per-frame super resolution. It is challenging to extend \operatorname{SR}_{h} to the temporal dimension due to memory and compute constraints, as well as a scarcity of high resolution video data. So \operatorname{SR}_{h} operates only along the spatial dimensions. But to encourage consistent detail hallucination across frames, we use the same noise initialization for each frame. Motivated by separable convolutions (Chollet, 2017), we stack a 1D convolution following each 2D convolutional (conv) layer, as shown in Fig. 3. This facilitates information sharing between the spatial and temporal axes, without succumbing to the heavy computational load of 3D conv layers. In addition, it creates a concrete partition between the pre-trained 2D conv layers and the newly initialized 1D conv layers, allowing us to train the temporal convolutions from scratch, while retaining the previously learned spatial knowledge in the spatial convolutions’ weights. Frame rate conditioning. In addition to the T2I conditionings, similar to CogVideo (Hong et al., 2022), we add an additional conditioning parameter fps, representing the number of frames-per-second in a generated video. Conditioning on a varying number of frames-per-second, enables an additional augmentation method to tackle the limited volume of available videos at training time, and provides additional control on the generated video at inference time. Make-A-Video differs from previous works in several aspects. First, our architecture breaks the dependency on text-video pairs for T2V generation.This is a significant advantage compared to prior work, that has to be restricted to narrow domains (Mittal et al., 2017; Gupta et al., 2018; Ge et al., 2022; Hayes et al., 2022), or require large-scale paired text-video data (Hong et al., 2022; Ho et al., 2022).Second, we fine-tune the T2I model for video generation, gaining the advantage of adapting the model weights effectively, compared to freezing the weights as in CogVideo (Hong et al., 2022).Third, motivated from prior work on efficient architectures for video and 3D vision tasks (Ye et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018), our use of pseudo-3D convolution (Qiu et al., 2017) and temporal attention layers not only better leverage a T2I architecture, it also allows for better temporal information fusion compared to VDM (Ho et al., 2022).","Pseudo-3D convolutional layers facilitates information sharing between the spatial and temporal axes, without succumbing to the heavy computational load of 3D conv layers.

334,"the generated videos inherit the vastness (diversity in aesthetic, fantastical depictions, etc.) of today’s image generation models.","As with all large-scale models trained on data from the web, our models have learnt and likely exaggerated social biases, including harmful ones. Our T2I generation model was trained on data that removed NSFW content and toxic words. All our data (image as well as videos) is publicly available, adding a layer of transparency to our models, and making it possible for the community to reproduce our work. Text-to-Video Generation.While there is remarkable progress in T2I generation, the progress of T2V generation lags behind largely due to two main reasons: the lack of large-scale datasets with high-quality text-video pairs, and the complexity of modeling higher-dimensional video data. Early works (Mittal et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Marwah et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Gupta et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019b) are mainly focused on video generation in simple domains, such as moving digits or specific human actions. To our knowledge, Sync-DRAW (Mittal et al., 2017) is the first T2V generation approach that leverages a VAE with recurrent attention. (Pan et al., 2017) and (Li et al., 2018) extend GANs from image generation to T2V generation. Leveraging Image Priors for Video Generation.Due to the complexity of modeling videos and the challenges in high-quality video data collection, it is natural to consider leveraging image priors for videos to simplifying the learning process. After all, an image is a video with a single frame (Bain et al., 2021). In unconditional video generation, MoCoGAN-HD (Tian et al., 2021) formulates video generation as the task of finding a trajectory in the latent space of a pre-trained and fixed image generation model. In T2V generation, NÜWA (Wu et al., 2021b) combines image and video datasets in a multitask pre-training stage to improve model generalization for fine-tuning. CogVideo (Hong et al., 2022) uses a pre-trained and fixed T2I model for T2V generation with only a small number of trainable parameters to reduce memory usage during training. But the fixed autoencoder and T2I models can be restrictive for T2V generation. The architecture of VDM (Ho et al., 2022) can enable joint image and video generation. However, they sample random independent images from random videos as their source of images, and do not leverage the massive text-image datasets. Make-A-Video differs from previous works in several aspects. First, our architecture breaks the dependency on text-video pairs for T2V generation.This is a significant advantage compared to prior work, that has to be restricted to narrow domains (Mittal et al., 2017; Gupta et al., 2018; Ge et al., 2022; Hayes et al., 2022), or require large-scale paired text-video data (Hong et al., 2022; Ho et al., 2022).Second, we fine-tune the T2I model for video generation, gaining the advantage of adapting the model weights effectively, compared to freezing the weights as in CogVideo (Hong et al., 2022).Third, motivated from prior work on efficient architectures for video and 3D vision tasks (Ye et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018), our use of pseudo-3D convolution (Qiu et al., 2017) and temporal attention layers not only better leverage a T2I architecture, it also allows for better temporal information fusion compared to VDM (Ho et al., 2022).","Modeling videos require expensive computational complexity that it is challenging in high-quality video data collection.

335,How could this vastness be defined or quantitatively measured?,"Automatic Metrics.For UCF-101, we write one template sentence for each class (without generating any video) and fix it for evaluation. We report Frechet Video Distance (FVD) and Inception Score (IS) on 10K samples following (Ho et al., 2022). We generate samples that follow the same class distribution as the training set. For MSR-VTT, we report Frechet Inception Distance (FID) (Parmar et al., 2022) and CLIPSIM (average CLIP similarity between video frames and text) (Wu et al., 2021a), where all 59,794 captions from the test set are used, following (Wu et al., 2021b). Human Evaluation Set and Metrics.We collect an evaluation set from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) that consists of 300 prompts. We asked annotators what they would be interested in generating if there were a T2V system. We filtered out prompts that were incomplete (e.g., “jump into water”), too abstract (e.g., “climate change”), or offensive. We then identified 5 categories (animals, fantasy, people, nature and scenes, food and beverage) and selected prompts for these categories. These prompts were selected without generating any videos for them, and were kept fixed. In addition, we also used the DrawBench prompts from Imagen (Saharia et al., 2022) for human evaluation.We evaluate video quality and text-video faithfulness. For video quality, we show two videos in random order and ask annotators which one is of higher quality. For faithfulness, we additionally show the text and ask annotators which video has a better correspondence with the text (we suggest them to ignore quality issues). In addition, we also conducted human evaluation to compare video motion realism of our interpolation model and FILM (Reda et al., 2022).For each comparison, we use the majority vote from 5 different annotators as the final result.","They employed annotators to make prompts and filtered out them correctly.

336,"Does this use text input as well or not? I thought it should use a text prompt to reflect a natural flow of images, but it does not seem to.","The Internet has fueled collecting billions of (alt-text, image) pairs from HTML pages (Schuhmann et al., 2022), enabling the recent breakthroughs in Text-to-Image (T2I) modeling. However, replicating this success for videos is limited since a similarly sized (text, video) dataset cannot be easily collected.It would be wasteful to train Text-to-Video (T2V) models from scratchwhen there already exist models that can generate images.Moreover, unsupervised learning enables networks to learn from orders of magnitude more data. This large quantity of data is important to learn representations of more subtle, less common concepts in the world. Unsupervised learning has long had great success in advancing the field of natural language processing (NLP) (Liu et al., 2019a; Brown et al., 2020). Models pre-trained this way yield considerably higher performance than when solely trained in a supervised manner. Inspired by these motivations, we propose Make-A-Video. Make-A-Video leverages T2I models to learn the correspondence between text and the visual world, and uses unsupervised learning on unlabeled (unpaired) video data, to learn realistic motion. Together, Make-A-Video generates videos from text without leveraging paired text-video data. Clearly, text describing images does not capture the entirety of phenomena observed in videos. That said, one can often infer actions and events from static images (e.g. a woman drinking coffee, or an elephant kicking a football) as done in image-based action recognition systems (Girish et al., 2020). Moreover, even without text descriptions, unsupervised videos are sufficient to learn how different entities in the world move and interact (e.g. the motion of waves at the beach, or of an elephant’s trunk). As a result, a model that has only seen text describing images is surprisingly effective at generating short videos, as demonstrated by our temporal diffusion-based method. Make-A-Video sets the new state-of-the-art in T2V generation. The different components of Make-A-Video described above are trained independently. The only component that receives text as input is the prior \operatorname{P}. We train it on paired text-image data and do not fine-tune it on videos. The decoder, prior, and two super-resolution components are first trained on images alone (no aligned text). Recall that the decoder receives CLIP image embedding as input, and the super-resolution components receive downsampled images as input during training.After training on images, we add and initialize the new temporal layers and fine-tune them over unlabeled video data.16 frames are sampled from the original video with random fps ranging from 1 to 30. We use the beta function for sampling and while training the decoder, start from higher FPS ranges (less motion) and then transition to lower FPS ranges (more motion).The masked-frame-interpolation component is fine-tuned from the temporal decoder. Human Evaluation.We compare to CogVideo (the only public zero-shot T2V generation model) on DrawBench and our test set. We also evaluate on the 28 videos shown on the webpage of VDM (Ho et al., 2022) (which may be biased towards showcasing the model’s strengths). Since this is a very small test set, we randomly generate 8 videos for each input and perform evaluation 8 times and report the average results.We generate videos at 76\times 256\times 256 resolution for human evaluation.The results are shown in Table 3. Make-A-Video achieves much better performance in both video quality and text-video faithfulness in all benchmarks and comparisons. For CogVideo, the results are similar on DrawBench and our evaluation set. For VDM, it is worth noting that we have achieved significantly better resultswithout any cherry-picking.We also evaluate our frame interpolation network in comparison to FILM (Reda et al., 2022). We first generate low frame rate videos (1 FPS) from text prompts in DrawBench and our evaluation set, then use each method to upsample to 4 FPS. Raters choose our method for more realistic motion 62% of the time on our evaluation set and 54% of the time on DrawBench. We observe that our method excels when there are large differences between frames where having real-world knowledge of how objects move is crucial. As a next step we plan to address several of the technical limitations. As discussed earlier, our approach can not learn associations between text and phenomenon that can only be inferred in videos. How to incorporate these (e.g., generating a video of a person waving their hand left-to-right or right-to-left), along with generating longer videos, with multiple scenes and events, depicting more detailed stories, is left for future work. Our main contributions are:•We present Make-A-Video – an effective method that extends a diffusion-based T2I model to T2V through a spatiotemporally factorized diffusion model.•We leverage joint text-image priors to bypass the need for paired text-video data, which in turn allows us to potentially scale to larger quantities of video data.•We present super-resolution strategies in space and time that, for the first time, generate high-definition, high frame-rate videos given a user-provided textual input.•We evaluate Make-A-Video against existing T2V systems and present: (a) State-of-the-art results in quantitative as well as qualitative measures, and (b) A more thorough evaluation than existing literature in T2V. We also collect a test set of 300 prompts for zero-shot T2V human evaluation which we plan to release.","Make-A-Video adopt unsupervised learning method by leveraging joint text-image prior that it is not need paried text-video data.

In this section, we will show T2V generation comparison to CogVideo (Hong et al., 2022) and VDM (Ho et al., 2022), and video interpolation comparison to FILM (Reda et al., 2022).In addition, our models can be used for a variety of other tasks such as image animation, video variation, etc. Due to space constraint, we only show a single example of each.Figure 4 (a) shows the comparison of Make-A-Video to CogVideo and VDM. Make-A-Video can generate richer content with motion consistency and text correspondence.Figure 4 (b) shows an example of image animation where we condition the masked frame interpolation and extrapolation network \uparrow_{F} on the image and CLIP image embedding to extrapolate the rest of the video. This allows a user to generate a video using their own image – giving them the opportunity to personalize and directly control the generated video. Figure 4 (c) shows a comparison of our approach to FILM (Reda et al., 2022) on the task of interpolation between two images. We achieve this by using the interpolation model that takes the two images as the beginning and end frames and masks 14 frames in between for generation. Our model generates more semantically meaningful interpolation while FILM seems to primarily smoothly transition between frames without semantic real-world understanding of what is moving. Figure 4 (d) shows an example for video variation. We take the average CLIP embedding of all frames from a video as the condition to generate a semantically similar video.More video generation examples and applications can be found here: make-a-video.github.io.

338,What does this initial results mean?,"To demonstrate our approach on unconditional generation, we use a popular benchmark of Soomro et al. (2012) for unconditional modeling of video. The benchmark consists of short clips of people performing one of 101 activities, and was originally collected for the purpose of training action recognition models. We model short segments of 16 frames from this dataset, downsampled to a spatial resolution of 64x64. In Table 1 we present perceptual quality scores for videos generated by our model, and we compare against methods from the literature, finding that our method strongly improves upon the previous state-of-the-art.  We additionally evaluate video prediction performance on the Kinetics-600 benchmark (Kay et al., 2017; Carreira et al., 2018). Kinetics-600 contains approximately 400 thousand training videos depicting 600 different activities. We train unconditional models on this dataset at the 64\times 64 resolution and evaluate on 50 thousand randomly sampled videos from the test set, where we condition on a randomly sampled subsequence of 5 frames and generate the next 11 frames. Like previous works, we calculate FVD and Inception Score using the I3D network (Carreira and Zisserman, 2017). See Table 3 for results. In our reported results we sample test videos without replacement, and we use the same randomly selected subsequences for generating model samples and for defining the ground truth, since this results in the lowest bias and variance in the reported FVD metric. However, from personal communication we learned that (Luc et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2019) instead sampled with replacement, and used a different random seed when sampling the ground truth data. We find that this way of evaluating raises the FVD obtained by our model slightly, from 16.2 to 16.9. Inception Score is unaffected. The remaining experiments reported are on text-conditioned video generation. In this text-conditioned video generation setting, we employ a dataset of 10 million captioned videos, and we condition the diffusion model on captions in the form of BERT-large embeddings (Devlin et al., 2019) processed using attention pooling. We consider two model sizes: a small model for the joint training ablation, and a large model for generating the remaining results (both architectures are described in detail in Appendix A), and we explore the effects of joint video-image training, classifier-free guidance, and our newly proposed reconstruction guidance method for autoregressive extension and simultaneous spatial and temporal super-resolution. We report the following metrics in this section on 4096 samples: the video metric FVD, and the Inception-based image metrics FID and IS measured by averaging activations across frames (FID/IS-avg) and by measuring the first frame only (FID/IS-first). For FID and FVD, we report two numbers which are measured against the training and validation sets, respectively. For IS, we report two numbers which are averaged scores across 1 split and 10 splits of samples, respectively. Table 4 reports results for an experiment on text-conditioned 16x64x64 videos, where we consider training on an additional 0, 4, or 8 independent image frames per video.One can see clear improvements in video and image sample quality metrics as more independent image frames are added. Adding independent image frames has the effect of reducing variance of the gradient at the expense of some bias for the video modeling objective, and thus it can be seen as a memory optimization to fit more independent examples in a batch. Table 5 reports results that verify the effectiveness of classifier-free guidance (Ho and Salimans, 2021) on text-to-video generation. As expected, there is clearimprovement in the Inception Score-like metrics with higher guidance weight, while the FID-like metrics improve and then degrade with increasing guidance weight. Similar findings have been reported on text-to-image generation (Nichol et al., 2021). Figure 3 shows the effect of classifier-free guidance (Ho and Salimans, 2021) on a text-conditioned video model. Similar to what was observed in other work that used classifier-free guidance on text-conditioned image generation (Nichol et al., 2021) and class-conditioned image generation (Ho and Salimans, 2021; Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021), adding guidance increases the sample fidelity of each individual image and emphases the effect of the conditioning signal. In Section 3.1 we proposed the reconstruction guidance method for conditional sampling from diffusion models, an improvement over the replacement method ofSong et al. (2021).In Table 6 we present results on generating longer videos using both techniques, and find that our proposed method indeed improves over the replacement method in terms of perceptual quality scores.","Video diffusion models present the first results on a large text-conditioned video generation tasks, and they achieve state-of-the-art results on popular video datasets. They train the model with image-video jointly to improve sample quality. Moreover, the conditional sampling method, introduced in Section 3.1, shows better quality compared to the existing replacement method.",CycleGAN and PatchGAN,0.0416666654947917,0.0,0.0416666654947917,0.6149917424924614,3.7434783096707993,3.689093777336372,0.0093632958801498,0.0005878894767783,0.1877120584249496,0.0,0.18856281042099,,0.0009646220191772,,0.718641814789536,0.8053808588928225
339,Does making higher resolution have to be incorporated into the network? Can't we do this as a separate process?,"We show that high quality videos can be generated using essentially the standard formulation of the Gaussian diffusion model (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015), with little modification other than straightforward architectural changes to accommodate video data within the memory constraints of deep learning accelerators. We train models that generate a fixed number of video frames using a 3D U-Net diffusion model architecture, and we enable generating longer videos by applying this model autoregressively using a new method for conditional generation. We additionally show the benefits of joint training on video and image modeling objectives. We test our methods on video prediction and unconditional video generation, where we achieve state-of-the-art sample quality scores, and we also show promising first results on text-conditioned video generation. The videos we consider modeling typically consist of hundreds to thousands of frames, at a frame rate of at least 24 frames per second. To manage the computational requirements of training our models, we only train on a small subset of say 16 frames at a time. However, at test time we can generate longer videos by extending our samples. For example, we could first generate a video \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}\sim p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) consisting of 16 frames, and then extend it with a second sample \mathbf{x}^{\text{b}}\sim p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}^{\text{b}}|\mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}). If \mathbf{x}^{\text{b}} consists of frames following \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}, this allows us to autoregressively extend our sampled videos to arbitrary lengths, which we demonstrate in Section 4.3.3. Alternatively, we could choose \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}} to represent a video of lower frame rate, and then define \mathbf{x}^{\text{b}} to be those frames in between the frames of \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}.This allows one to then to upsample a video temporally, similar to how Menick and Kalchbrenner (2019) generate high resolution images through spatial upsampling. Reconstruction guidance also extends to the case of spatial interpolation (or super-resolution), in which the mean squared error loss is imposed on a downsampled version of the model prediction, and backpropagation is performed through this downsampling.In this setting, we have low resolution ground truth videos \mathbf{x}^{a} (e.g. at the 64x64 spatial resolution), which may be generated from a low resolution model, and we wish to upsample them into high resolution videos (e.g. at the 128x128 spatial resolution) using an unconditional high resolution diffusion model \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\theta}. To accomplish this, we adjust the high resolution model as follows:𝐱~θ(𝐳t)=𝐱^θ(𝐳t)−wr⁢αt2∇𝐳t∥𝐱a−𝐱^θa(𝐳t)∥22\displaystyle\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t})=\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t})-\frac{w_{r}\alpha_{t}}{2}\nabla_{\mathbf{z}_{t}}\lVert\mathbf{x}^{a}-\hat{\mathbf{x}}^{a}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t})\rVert_{2}^{2}over~ start_ARG bold_x end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) = over^ start_ARG bold_x end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) - divide start_ARG italic_w start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_α start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG ∇ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∥ bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - over^ start_ARG bold_x end_ARG start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ∥ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT(8)where \hat{\mathbf{x}}^{a}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t}) is our model’s reconstruction of the low-resolution video from \mathbf{z}_{t}, which is obtained by downsampling the high resolution output of the model using a differentiable downsampling algorithm such as bilinear interpolation.Note that it is also possible to simultaneously condition on low resolution videos while autoregressively extending samples at the high resolution using the same reconstruction guidance method. In Fig. 2, we show samples of this approach for extending 16x64x64 low resolution samples at frameskip 4 to 64x128x128 samples at frameskip 1 using a 9x128x128 diffusion model. Our approach to video generation using diffusion models is to use the standard diffusion model formalism described in Section 2 with a neural network architecture suitable for video data. Each of our models is trained to jointly model a fixed number of frames at a fixed spatial resolution. To extend sampling to longer sequences of frames or higher spatial resolutions, we will repurpose our models with a conditioning technique described later in Section 3.1.","Video diffusion models modify little of the archicture to accommodate video data within the memory constraints of deep learning accelerators. They approach with the standard diffusion modelformalism. In their method, one of skill to make high resolution video is the spatial upsampling introduced by Menick and Kalchbrenner (2019).
Also, reconstruction guidance is extended to constuct the high-resolution model. When they have low resolution ground truth videos, it upsamples them into high resolution videos using an unconditional high resolution diffusion model.","Pros of the interaction-based models (Figure 2(b) and (c)):

* Superior for IR tasks (Guo et al., 2019; Mitra et al., 2018)

Cons of the interaction-based models:

* Computationally expensive
* Limited by the number of documents that can be processed in a single batch

Pros of the representation-focused model (Figure 2(d)):

* Pre-computes document representations offline, reducing computational load per query
* Allows for efficient vector-similarity search indexes (Johnson et al., 2017; Abuzaid et al., 2019)

Cons of the representation-focused model:

* May not be as effective for IR tasks as interaction-based models

Distinctions of the proposed model (ColBERT):

* Combines the fine-grained matching of interaction-based models with the pre-computation of document representations of representation-based models
* Allows for efficient retrieval of top-k results directly from a large document collection, improving recall over models that only re-rank the output of term-based retrieval",0.0945945897260776,0.0199004927858232,0.0945945897260776,0.7362215468888949,20.347472336271736,16.867093720580133,0.1117886178861788,0.0104052972422324,0.1747111082077026,0.438649693475896,0.2086006551980972,0.3526154160499573,0.0062327204548913,0.1666666666666666,0.7473916697047844,0.7741711547259389
340,What does it mean to perform better in Text-to-Video generation? Does it mean that generated videos are aligned well with the text description?,"Figure 3 shows the effect of classifier-free guidance (Ho and Salimans, 2021) on a text-conditioned video model. Similar to what was observed in other work that used classifier-free guidance on text-conditioned image generation (Nichol et al., 2021) and class-conditioned image generation (Ho and Salimans, 2021; Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021), adding guidance increases the sample fidelity of each individual image and emphases the effect of the conditioning signal. Our goal with this work is to advance research on methods in generative modeling, and our methods have the potential to positively impact creative downstream applications. As with prior work in generative modeling, however, our methods have the potential for causing harmful impact and could enhance malicious or unethical uses of generative models, such as fake content generation, harassment, and misinformation spread, and thus we have decided not to release our models. Like all generative models, our models reflect the biases of their training datasets and thus may require curation to ensure fair results from sampling. In particular, our text-to-video models inherit the challenges faced by prior work on text-to-image models, and our future work will involve auditing for forms of social bias, similar to Buolamwini and Gebru (2018); Burns et al. (2018); Steed and Caliskan (2021); Cho et al. (2022) for image-to-text and image labeling models. We see our work as only a starting point for further investigation on video diffusion models and investigation into their societal implications, and we will aim to explore benchmark evaluations for social and cultural bias in the video generation setting and make the necessary research advances to address them.",The higher performance in Text-to-Video Generation requires not only excellent fidelity of video samples but also good handling of social bias in text-description given as a condition.,"T0 and Tk-INSTRUCT are different in their instruction data and training objectives.

341,What does this condition include? Text input?,"We report our results on video diffusion models for unconditional video generation (Section 4.1), conditional video generation (video prediction) (Section 4.2), and text-conditioned video generation (Section 4.3). We evaluate our models using standard metrics such as FVD (Unterthiner et al., 2018), FID (Heusel et al., 2017), and IS (Salimans et al., 2016); details on evaluation are provided below alongside each benchmark.Samples and additional results are provided at https://video-diffusion.github.io/.Architecture hyperparameters, training details, and compute resources are listed in Appendix A. A common benchmark task for evaluating generative models of video is video prediction, where the model is given the first frame(s) of a video and is asked to generate the remainder. Models that do well on this conditional generation task are usually trained explicitly for this conditional setting, for example by being autoregressive across frames. Although our models are instead only trained unconditionally, we can adapt them to the video prediction setting by using the guidance method proposed in section 3.1. Here we evaluate this method on two popular video prediction benchmarks, obtaining state-of-the-art results. The remaining experiments reported are on text-conditioned video generation. In this text-conditioned video generation setting, we employ a dataset of 10 million captioned videos, and we condition the diffusion model on captions in the form of BERT-large embeddings (Devlin et al., 2019) processed using attention pooling. We consider two model sizes: a small model for the joint training ablation, and a large model for generating the remaining results (both architectures are described in detail in Appendix A), and we explore the effects of joint video-image training, classifier-free guidance, and our newly proposed reconstruction guidance method for autoregressive extension and simultaneous spatial and temporal super-resolution. We report the following metrics in this section on 4096 samples: the video metric FVD, and the Inception-based image metrics FID and IS measured by averaging activations across frames (FID/IS-avg) and by measuring the first frame only (FID/IS-first). For FID and FVD, we report two numbers which are measured against the training and validation sets, respectively. For IS, we report two numbers which are averaged scores across 1 split and 10 splits of samples, respectively. Table 4 reports results for an experiment on text-conditioned 16x64x64 videos, where we consider training on an additional 0, 4, or 8 independent image frames per video.One can see clear improvements in video and image sample quality metrics as more independent image frames are added. Adding independent image frames has the effect of reducing variance of the gradient at the expense of some bias for the video modeling objective, and thus it can be seen as a memory optimization to fit more independent examples in a batch. Figure 3 shows the effect of classifier-free guidance (Ho and Salimans, 2021) on a text-conditioned video model. Similar to what was observed in other work that used classifier-free guidance on text-conditioned image generation (Nichol et al., 2021) and class-conditioned image generation (Ho and Salimans, 2021; Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021), adding guidance increases the sample fidelity of each individual image and emphases the effect of the conditioning signal. In the conditional generation setting, the data \mathbf{x} is equipped with a conditioning signal \mathbf{c}, which may represent a class label, text caption, or other type of conditioning. To train a diffusion model to fit p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{c}), the only modification that needs to be made is to provide \mathbf{c} to the model as \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{c}). Improvements to sample quality can be obtained in this setting by using classifier-free guidance (Ho and Salimans, 2021). This method samples using adjusted model predictions \tilde{{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}}_{\theta}, constructed via\displaystyle\tilde{{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{c})=(1+w){\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{c})-w{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t}),(6)where w is the guidance strength, {\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{c})=\frac{1}{\sigma_{t}}(\mathbf{z}_{t}-\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{c})) is the regular conditional model prediction, and {\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t}) is a prediction from an unconditional model jointly trained with the conditional model (if \mathbf{c} consists of embedding vectors, unconditional modeling can be represented as \mathbf{c}=\mathbf{0}). For w>0 this adjustment has the effect of over-emphasizing the effect of conditioning on the signal \mathbf{c}, which tends to produce samples of lower diversity but higher quality compared to sampling from the regular conditional model (Ho and Salimans, 2021). The method can be interpreted as a way to guide the samples towards areas where an implicit classifier p(\mathbf{c}|\mathbf{z}_{t}) has high likelihood, and is an adaptation of the explicit classifier guidance method proposed by Dhariwal and Nichol (2021).","Video Diffusion Model can be conditioned on text descriptions or image frame.

342,How does the authors accommodate the video datasets?,"We show that high quality videos can be generated using essentially the standard formulation of the Gaussian diffusion model (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015), with little modification other than straightforward architectural changes to accommodate video data within the memory constraints of deep learning accelerators. We train models that generate a fixed number of video frames using a 3D U-Net diffusion model architecture, and we enable generating longer videos by applying this model autoregressively using a new method for conditional generation. We additionally show the benefits of joint training on video and image modeling objectives. We test our methods on video prediction and unconditional video generation, where we achieve state-of-the-art sample quality scores, and we also show promising first results on text-conditioned video generation. To demonstrate our approach on unconditional generation, we use a popular benchmark of Soomro et al. (2012) for unconditional modeling of video. The benchmark consists of short clips of people performing one of 101 activities, and was originally collected for the purpose of training action recognition models. We model short segments of 16 frames from this dataset, downsampled to a spatial resolution of 64x64. In Table 1 we present perceptual quality scores for videos generated by our model, and we compare against methods from the literature, finding that our method strongly improves upon the previous state-of-the-art.  We additionally evaluate video prediction performance on the Kinetics-600 benchmark (Kay et al., 2017; Carreira et al., 2018). Kinetics-600 contains approximately 400 thousand training videos depicting 600 different activities. We train unconditional models on this dataset at the 64\times 64 resolution and evaluate on 50 thousand randomly sampled videos from the test set, where we condition on a randomly sampled subsequence of 5 frames and generate the next 11 frames. Like previous works, we calculate FVD and Inception Score using the I3D network (Carreira and Zisserman, 2017). See Table 3 for results. In our reported results we sample test videos without replacement, and we use the same randomly selected subsequences for generating model samples and for defining the ground truth, since this results in the lowest bias and variance in the reported FVD metric. However, from personal communication we learned that (Luc et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2019) instead sampled with replacement, and used a different random seed when sampling the ground truth data. We find that this way of evaluating raises the FVD obtained by our model slightly, from 16.2 to 16.9. Inception Score is unaffected. As described in Section 3, one of the main advantages of our video architecture is that it allows us to easily train the model jointly on video and image generative modeling objectives. To implement this joint training, we concatenate random independent image frames to the end of each video sampled from the dataset, and we mask the attention in the temporal attention blocks to prevent mixing information across video frames and each individual image frame. We choose these random independent images from random videos within the same dataset; in future work we plan to explore the effect of choosing images from other larger image-only datasets. We propose to extend this image diffusion model architecture to video data, given by a block of a fixed number of frames, using a particular type of 3D U-Net (Çiçek et al., 2016) that is factorized over space and time. First, we modify the image model architecture by changing each 2D convolution into a space-only 3D convolution, for instance, we change each 3x3 convolution into a 1x3x3 convolution (the first axis indexes video frames, the second and third index the spatial height and width). The attention in each spatial attention block remains as attention over space; i.e., the first axis is treated as a batch axis. Second, after each spatial attention block, we insert a temporalattention block that performs attention over the first axis and treats the spatial axes as batch axes.We use relative position embeddings (Shaw et al., 2018) in each temporal attention block so that the network can distinguish ordering of frames in a way that does not require an absolute notion of video time. We visualize the model architecture in Fig. 1.","Other diffusion models that generate images use a 2D U-Net, but they use a 3D U-Net to handle video.

344,Why does it have to be fixed? Can't we extend it to more frames?,"We show that high quality videos can be generated using essentially the standard formulation of the Gaussian diffusion model (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015), with little modification other than straightforward architectural changes to accommodate video data within the memory constraints of deep learning accelerators.

We test our methods on video prediction and unconditional video generation, where we achieve state-of-the-art sample quality scores, and we also show promising first results on text-conditioned video generation. The videos we consider modeling typically consist of hundreds to thousands of frames, at a frame rate of at least 24 frames per second. To manage the computational requirements of training our models, we only train on a small subset of say 16 frames at a time. However, at test time we can generate longer videos by extending our samples. For example, we could first generate a video \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}\sim p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) consisting of 16 frames, and then extend it with a second sample \mathbf{x}^{\text{b}}\sim p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}^{\text{b}}|\mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}). If \mathbf{x}^{\text{b}} consists of frames following \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}, this allows us to autoregressively extend our sampled videos to arbitrary lengths, which we demonstrate in Section 4.3.3. Alternatively, we could choose \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}} to represent a video of lower frame rate, and then define \mathbf{x}^{\text{b}} to be those frames in between the frames of \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}.This allows one to then to upsample a video temporally, similar to how Menick and Kalchbrenner (2019) generate high resolution images through spatial upsampling.

346,Is there a rule or criteria to have certain number of frames per second for a video? I think the number of frames per second can bring some bias in training.,"The videos we consider modeling typically consist of hundreds to thousands of frames, at a frame rate of at least 24 frames per second. To manage the computational requirements of training our models, we only train on a small subset of say 16 frames at a time. However, at test time we can generate longer videos by extending our samples. For example, we could first generate a video \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}\sim p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) consisting of 16 frames, and then extend it with a second sample \mathbf{x}^{\text{b}}\sim p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}^{\text{b}}|\mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}). If \mathbf{x}^{\text{b}} consists of frames following \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}, this allows us to autoregressively extend our sampled videos to arbitrary lengths, which we demonstrate in Section 4.3.3. Alternatively, we could choose \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}} to represent a video of lower frame rate, and then define \mathbf{x}^{\text{b}} to be those frames in between the frames of \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}.This allows one to then to upsample a video temporally, similar to how Menick and Kalchbrenner (2019) generate high resolution images through spatial upsampling. A common benchmark task for evaluating generative models of video is video prediction, where the model is given the first frame(s) of a video and is asked to generate the remainder. Models that do well on this conditional generation task are usually trained explicitly for this conditional setting, for example by being autoregressive across frames. Although our models are instead only trained unconditionally, we can adapt them to the video prediction setting by using the guidance method proposed in section 3.1. Here we evaluate this method on two popular video prediction benchmarks, obtaining state-of-the-art results. We evaluate video prediction performance on BAIR Robot Pushing (Ebert et al., 2017), a standard benchmark in the video literature consisting of approximately 44000 videos of robot pushing motions at the 64x64 spatial resolution. Methods for this benchmark are conditioned on 1 frame and generate the next 15. Results are listed in Table 3. Following the evaluation protocol of Babaeizadeh et al. (2021) and others, we calculate FVD (Unterthiner et al., 2018) using the I3D network (Carreira and Zisserman, 2017) by comparing 100\times 256 model samples against the 256 examples in the evaluation set. We additionally evaluate video prediction performance on the Kinetics-600 benchmark (Kay et al., 2017; Carreira et al., 2018). Kinetics-600 contains approximately 400 thousand training videos depicting 600 different activities. We train unconditional models on this dataset at the 64\times 64 resolution and evaluate on 50 thousand randomly sampled videos from the test set, where we condition on a randomly sampled subsequence of 5 frames and generate the next 11 frames. Like previous works, we calculate FVD and Inception Score using the I3D network (Carreira and Zisserman, 2017). See Table 3 for results. In our reported results we sample test videos without replacement, and we use the same randomly selected subsequences for generating model samples and for defining the ground truth, since this results in the lowest bias and variance in the reported FVD metric. However, from personal communication we learned that (Luc et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2019) instead sampled with replacement, and used a different random seed when sampling the ground truth data. We find that this way of evaluating raises the FVD obtained by our model slightly, from 16.2 to 16.9. Inception Score is unaffected. As described in Section 3, one of the main advantages of our video architecture is that it allows us to easily train the model jointly on video and image generative modeling objectives. To implement this joint training, we concatenate random independent image frames to the end of each video sampled from the dataset, and we mask the attention in the temporal attention blocks to prevent mixing information across video frames and each individual image frame. We choose these random independent images from random videos within the same dataset; in future work we plan to explore the effect of choosing images from other larger image-only datasets. Table 4 reports results for an experiment on text-conditioned 16x64x64 videos, where we consider training on an additional 0, 4, or 8 independent image frames per video.One can see clear improvements in video and image sample quality metrics as more independent image frames are added. Adding independent image frames has the effect of reducing variance of the gradient at the expense of some bias for the video modeling objective, and thus it can be seen as a memory optimization to fit more independent examples in a batch.","To manage the computational requirements of training our models, they only train on a small subset of say 16 frames at a time. But thier newly introduced joint training on video and image modeling, they concatenate random independent image frames to the end of each video sampled from the dataset. Due to memory constraints, they use fixed number of frames but these randomly sampled frames helps to reduce bias in training.
For evaluation, they adopt fixed number of conditioning samples and generating a sequence of video frames to compare other baselines.","Examples of noise for generated questions include irrelevant or nonsensical questions, duplicate questions, or questions that are too similar to the original passage",0.0731707280190364,0.0183486206312605,0.0731707280190364,0.9119981239179452,24.139058276664247,20.012509640386288,0.0382096069868995,0.0026068230760512,0.0949306115508079,0.557817735279988,0.153347834944725,0.4736084938049316,0.0086565233260115,0.3333333333333333,0.7349583958994431,0.7155032303868415
347,I understand that the quality of xb depends on xa. So the quality could get worse if we generate more frames?,"The videos we consider modeling typically consist of hundreds to thousands of frames, at a frame rate of at least 24 frames per second. To manage the computational requirements of training our models, we only train on a small subset of say 16 frames at a time.

If \mathbf{x}^{\text{b}} consists of frames following \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}, this allows us to autoregressively extend our sampled videos to arbitrary lengths, which we demonstrate in Section 4.3.3. Alternatively, we could choose \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}} to represent a video of lower frame rate, and then define \mathbf{x}^{\text{b}} to be those frames in between the frames of \mathbf{x}^{\text{a}}.This allows one to then to upsample a video temporally, similar to how Menick and Kalchbrenner (2019) generate high resolution images through spatial upsampling. In Section 3.1 we proposed the reconstruction guidance method for conditional sampling from diffusion models, an improvement over the replacement method ofSong et al. (2021).In Table 6 we present results on generating longer videos using both techniques, and find that our proposed method indeed improves over the replacement method in terms of perceptual quality scores. Figure 4 shows the samples of our reconstruction guidance method for conditional sampling compared to the replacement method (Section 3.1) for the purposes of generating long samples in a block-autoregressive manner (Section 4.3.3). The samples from the replacement method clearly show a lack of temporal coherence, since frames from different blocks throughout the generated videos appear to be uncorrelated samples (conditioned on \mathbf{c}). The samples from the reconstruction guidance method, by contrast, are clearly temporally coherent over the course of the entire autoregressive generation process. Figure 2 additionally shows samples of using the reconstruction guidance method to simultaneously condition on low frequency, low resolution videos while autoregressively extending temporally at a high resolution. We have additionally demonstrated the benefits of joint image-video training and classifier-free guidance for video diffusion models on both video and image sample quality metrics, and we also introduced a new reconstruction-guided conditional sampling method that outperforms existing replacement or imputation methods for conditional sampling from unconditionally trained models. Our reconstruction guidance method can generate long sequences using either frame interpolation (or temporal super-resolution) or extrapolation in an auto-regressive fashion, and also can perform spatial super-resolution.

348,Why did the authors focus on the verb? Is there any reason?,"Human is capable of one-shot learning [22, 23, 42]. For instance, given a video paired with a textual description of “a man is skiing on snow” as a hint, we might hallucinate how a panda skis on snow if we could picture what a panda looks like.Since T2I models pre-trained with large-scale image-text data already capture the knowledge of open-domain concepts,an intuitive question arises:can it infer other novel videos from a single video example like human beings?A new T2V generation problem is therefore introduced, namely, One-Shot Video Generation, where only a single text-video pair is presented for training an open-domain T2V generator.The generator is expected to capture necessary motion knowledge from the input video and synthesize novel videos guided by edited prompts. Formally, given a video \mathcal{V}=\left\{v_{i}|i\in[1,m]\right\} with m frames, accompanied with a corresponding textual description \mathcal{T}, our objective is to generate novel videos \hat{\mathcal{V}} driven by text prompts \hat{\mathcal{T}} using a pre-trained T2I model M, i.e., M(\hat{\mathcal{V}}|\mathcal{V},\mathcal{T},\hat{\mathcal{T}}), where \mathcal{T} and \hat{\mathcal{T}} share the same verbs.Examples of output variations driven by \hat{\mathcal{T}} include: changes of subject, background (e.g., the place where the subject is), attribute (e.g., color, age, etc.), and other semantic modifications (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 7). Intuitively, the key to video generation is to keep the continuous motion of consistent objects.So we make the following observations on state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models [31] that motivate our method accordingly.(1) Regarding motion: T2I models are able to generate images that align well with the text, including the verb terms. For example, given the text prompt “a man is running on the beach”, the T2I models produce the snapshot where a man is running (not walking or jumping), but not continuously (the first row of Fig. 2).This serves as evidence that T2I models can properly attend to verbs via cross-modal attention for static motion generation.(2) Regarding consistent objects: Simply extending the self-attention in the T2I model from one image to multiple images maintains content consistency across frames.Taking the same example, when we generate consecutive frames in parallel with extended cross-frame attention to the 1st frame, the same man and the same beach can be observed in the resultant sequence though the motion is still not continuous (the second row of Fig. 2). This implies that the self-attention layers in T2I models are only driven by spatial similarities rather than pixel positions. As shown in Fig. 9, the resultant video of “a woman is running on the lawn” generated by our Tune-A-Video trained on one text-video pair of “a man running on the beach”, is comparable to the one generated by CogVideo [19] trained on large-scale datasets. When we challenge the models using a more complex prompt, e.g., “a cat is running on the single-plank bridge, comic style”, our Tune-A-Video generates continuous video frames that are better aligned with the target prompt. This demonstrates that our model integrates the motion guidance from training video with the rich semantics of pre-trained T2I models for high temporal consistency and deep language understanding. See Fig. 15 for more qualitative comparisons with CogVideo.","The T2V generator is expected to capture necessary motion knowledge from the input video and synthesize novel videos guided by edited prompts.

349,"Just out of curiosity, how humans are so well at this? Cab human's technique be used for the machines as well? or do we need a totally different approach?","The large-scale multimodal dataset [35] with billions of text-image pairs crawled from Internet has enabled breakthrough in open-domain Text-to-Image (T2I) generation [25, 29, 4, 6, 34]. To replicate this success in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation, recent works [36, 14, 17, 48] extend the spatial-only T2I generation models to the spatio-temporal domain.These models generally adopt the standard paradigm to finetune T2I models on large-scale text-video datasets (e.g., WebVid-10M [2]).Although this paradigm produces decent results for T2V generation, it requires extensive training, which is expensive and not affordable to everyone. Human is capable of one-shot learning [22, 23, 42]. For instance, given a video paired with a textual description of “a man is skiing on snow” as a hint, we might hallucinate how a panda skis on snow if we could picture what a panda looks like.Since T2I models pre-trained with large-scale image-text data already capture the knowledge of open-domain concepts,an intuitive question arises:can it infer other novel videos from a single video example like human beings?A new T2V generation problem is therefore introduced, namely, One-Shot Video Generation, where only a single text-video pair is presented for training an open-domain T2V generator.The generator is expected to capture necessary motion knowledge from the input video and synthesize novel videos guided by edited prompts. One of the applications of our Tune-A-Video is to replace the subject in the training video. As shown in Fig. 7, Tune-A-Video is able to generate videos with customized subjects via changing the corresponding terms in text prompt, for example, replacing the polar bear with mammoth (the 2nd row of Fig. 7) in the “walking bear” example; replacing the man with King Kong or astronaut (the 7th and 8th row of Fig. 7) in the “running man” example.The generated videos are consistent in time and well-aligned with the modified text prompts. As shown in Fig. 9, the resultant video of “a woman is running on the lawn” generated by our Tune-A-Video trained on one text-video pair of “a man running on the beach”, is comparable to the one generated by CogVideo [19] trained on large-scale datasets. When we challenge the models using a more complex prompt, e.g., “a cat is running on the single-plank bridge, comic style”, our Tune-A-Video generates continuous video frames that are better aligned with the target prompt. This demonstrates that our model integrates the motion guidance from training video with the rich semantics of pre-trained T2I models for high temporal consistency and deep language understanding. See Fig. 15 for more qualitative comparisons with CogVideo. The models without One-Shot Tuning uses the weight of pre-trained T2I for inference. The tuning itself (the 2nd row of Fig. 10) captures spatial information and yields similar semantics as the training video (e.g., the panda skis like the man in training video). This implies that our one-shot tuning strategy is capable of performing semantic mixing as [24, 21], but with more flexibility that the object categories can be replaced. However, the temporal consistency cannot be maintained through individual frame attention (e.g., the pandas in the 2nd row of Fig. 10 are inconsistent). Although our Tune-A-Video w/o tuning (the 3nd row of Fig. 10) output consistent content across frames, it does not have a notion of motion since it is only trained on static images. With tuning, our full model (the 4nd row of Fig. 10) is able to generate the temporally-coherent video that incorporates the motion information (i.e., skiing) in the training video, demonstrating the effectiveness of our One-Shot Tuning. To imitate how humans adapt new visual concepts from a single exemplar, we introduce a new T2V generation task called One-Shot Video Generation, where only a single text-video pair is provided for training an open-domain T2V generator.To this end, we propose Tune-A-Video, a simple yet effective solution based on pretrained T2I diffusion models.Our method exploits the properties of pretrained T2I models by extending spatial self-attention to spatio-temporal domain with a tailored Sparse-Causal Attention.To capture necessary motion knowledge, we update the projection matrices in attention block on one training sample.

We provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons with CogVideo [19] (the only public333https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo T2V generation model). CogVideo is based on a pre-trained T2I model CogView2 [4] and consists of 9.4 billion parameters (around 6\times larger than our Tune-A-Video). It is extensively trained on a large-scale dataset of 5.4 million captioned videos. As shown in Fig. 9, the resultant video of “a woman is running on the lawn” generated by our Tune-A-Video trained on one text-video pair of “a man running on the beach”, is comparable to the one generated by CogVideo [19] trained on large-scale datasets. When we challenge the models using a more complex prompt, e.g., “a cat is running on the single-plank bridge, comic style”, our Tune-A-Video generates continuous video frames that are better aligned with the target prompt. This demonstrates that our model integrates the motion guidance from training video with the rich semantics of pre-trained T2I models for high temporal consistency and deep language understanding. See Fig. 15 for more qualitative comparisons with CogVideo. However, using full attention in space-time leads to quadratic growth in computation. It is thus infeasible for generating long-form videos with increasing frames.To reduce the computational complexity, we propose a novel variant of causal attention [19, 8], termed as Sparse-Causal Attention (SC-Attn). SC-Attn can be interpreted as a diluted version of causal attention which only visits the first video frame and the former video frame.SC-Attn is proven to be capable of properly capturing the motion in the training video.By autoregressively generating video frames, Tune-A-Video is able to produce videos of arbitrary lengths.","Tune-A-Video is based on a pre-trained T2I diffusion model and only updates the projection matrices in attention blocks, with the rest of parameters being frozen.

Here, we showcase two training examples: “a polar bear is walking on ice” (“walking bear”, the 1st row of Fig. 7), “a young man is running on the beach” (“running man”, the 5th row of Fig. 7), and their variations with edited prompts. More examples can be found in Fig. 12-14. We examine the ability of our Tune-A-Video in modifying the attributes such as color (e.g., a man wearing yellow to be in red, the 2nd row of Fig. 1) and age (e.g., a young man to become old, the 6th row of Fig. 7). We found that our Tune-A-Video even enables modifying the attribute that is not specified in the training prompt (e.g., we do not tell the model the skiing man in the training video wears yellow clothes). Notably, other properties in training video could be well preserved (e.g., the black backpack wore by the skiing man, and the blue shirts and black shorts wore by the running man). Thanks to the broad knowledge of pertrained T2I models, Tune-A-Video is able to transfer videos into different styles, which cannot be easily learned from video data [36].

For instance, given a video paired with a textual description of “a man is skiing on snow” as a hint, we might hallucinate how a panda skis on snow if we could picture what a panda looks like.Since T2I models pre-trained with large-scale image-text data already capture the knowledge of open-domain concepts,an intuitive question arises:can it infer other novel videos from a single video example like human beings?A new T2V generation problem is therefore introduced, namely, One-Shot Video Generation, where only a single text-video pair is presented for training an open-domain T2V generator.The generator is expected to capture necessary motion knowledge from the input video and synthesize novel videos guided by edited prompts. Intuitively, the key to video generation is to keep the continuous motion of consistent objects.So we make the following observations on state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models [31] that motivate our method accordingly.(1) Regarding motion: T2I models are able to generate images that align well with the text, including the verb terms. For example, given the text prompt “a man is running on the beach”, the T2I models produce the snapshot where a man is running (not walking or jumping), but not continuously (the first row of Fig. 2).This serves as evidence that T2I models can properly attend to verbs via cross-modal attention for static motion generation.(2) Regarding consistent objects: Simply extending the self-attention in the T2I model from one image to multiple images maintains content consistency across frames.Taking the same example, when we generate consecutive frames in parallel with extended cross-frame attention to the 1st frame, the same man and the same beach can be observed in the resultant sequence though the motion is still not continuous (the second row of Fig. 2). This implies that the self-attention layers in T2I models are only driven by spatial similarities rather than pixel positions. We provide several applications of our Tune-A-Video in generating videos with novel visual concepts (e.g., subjects, backgrounds, attributes, styles, etc.) guided by the text prompt. Here, we showcase two training examples: “a polar bear is walking on ice” (“walking bear”, the 1st row of Fig. 7), “a young man is running on the beach” (“running man”, the 5th row of Fig. 7), and their variations with edited prompts. More examples can be found in Fig. 12-14. Our Tune-A-Video also enables changing the video background (i.e., place where the subject is), while keeping the motions of the subject and the temporal information consistent. For example, we can “send” a polar bear walking on the ice to Time Square (the 3rd of Fig. 7), and a man running on the beach to mountain (the 6th row of Fig. 7). We observe that some background semantic is tied to the subject, e.g., in the case of “walking bear”, although the background is replaced with Time Square, the color of the ground still remains similar to ice. We conjecture this is due to the strong regularities between “polar bear” and “ice”. We examine the ability of our Tune-A-Video in modifying the attributes such as color (e.g., a man wearing yellow to be in red, the 2nd row of Fig. 1) and age (e.g., a young man to become old, the 6th row of Fig. 7). We found that our Tune-A-Video even enables modifying the attribute that is not specified in the training prompt (e.g., we do not tell the model the skiing man in the training video wears yellow clothes). Notably, other properties in training video could be well preserved (e.g., the black backpack wore by the skiing man, and the blue shirts and black shorts wore by the running man). We implement our findings into a simple yet effective method, dubbed as Tune-A-Video, for the task of One-Shot Video Generation.Tune-A-Video is based on a simple inflation of pre-trained T2I diffusion models [31] over time dimension, by extending the 3\times 3 convolution to 1\times 3\times 3, and spatial self-attention to spatio-temporal cross-frame attention.We propose an efficient tuning strategy that only updates the projection matrices in attention blocks to capture continuous motion dynamics from the one-shot video, with the rest of parameters being frozen. To imitate how humans adapt new visual concepts from a single exemplar, we introduce a new T2V generation task called One-Shot Video Generation, where only a single text-video pair is provided for training an open-domain T2V generator.To this end, we propose Tune-A-Video, a simple yet effective solution based on pretrained T2I diffusion models.Our method exploits the properties of pretrained T2I models by extending spatial self-attention to spatio-temporal domain with a tailored Sparse-Causal Attention.To capture necessary motion knowledge, we update the projection matrices in attention block on one training sample.

353,Does it have any performance degradation if we generate too many frames?,"We first follow VDM baselines [17, 14] to use inflated 1\times 3\times 3 convolution kernels for video inputs and append temporal self-attention with causal mask for temporal modeling. However, we empirically observe that factorized space-time attention in VDM baselines is insufficient to generate consistent content in the task of One-Shot Video Generation (see Sec. 4.3). We further inflate the spatial self-attention to cross-frame attention as follows. There are alternative options for cross-frame attention in Fig. 6, including full attention and causal attention which also capture spatio-temporal consistency.However, such straightforward choices are actually not feasible in generating videos with continuous frames due to their high computational complexity.Specifically, given m frames and N sequences for each frame, the complexity for full attention is \mathcal{O}((mN)^{2}).It is not affordable if we need to generate long-form videos with a large value of m.Though causal attention only visits the previous frames, it actually shows the same complexity as full attention since the attention mask needs to accommodate the longest sequence, i.e., mN. In SC-Attn, the query to the first frame \mathbf{v}_{1} maintains the global coherence in terms of generated content, while the query to former frame \mathbf{v}_{i-1} learns the necessary motion between consecutive frames. This design is motivated by the observation that a simple cross-frame attention that attends the first video frame enables generating a sequence of frames that are consistent in content (see Fig. 2). Thus, spatial consistency can be maintained by querying the key and value of another frame for attention. For temporal consistency, attending previous nearest frame \mathbf{v}_{i-1} gives a direct guidance of the motion between two consecutive frames. Empirically, SC-Attn is able to generate temporally-coherent video frames with smooth transition, and meanwhile remain low computational complexity at \mathcal{O}(2m(N)^{2}). Moreover, as a diluted version of casual attention, SC-Attn naturally supports autoregressive generation of long video sequence through cross-frame attention to the intermediate features of early generated frames. Fig. 11 shows instances of long sequence generation. However, using full attention in space-time leads to quadratic growth in computation. It is thus infeasible for generating long-form videos with increasing frames.To reduce the computational complexity, we propose a novel variant of causal attention [19, 8], termed as Sparse-Causal Attention (SC-Attn). SC-Attn can be interpreted as a diluted version of causal attention which only visits the first video frame and the former video frame.SC-Attn is proven to be capable of properly capturing the motion in the training video.By autoregressively generating video frames, Tune-A-Video is able to produce videos of arbitrary lengths.",Figure 8 shows that the VDM baselines with factorized space-time attention fail to generate consistent content. But Tune-A-Video can generate better temporal consistency video.,"The contrastive loss function works by pulling together positive pairs (i.e., matching faces) and pushing apart negative pairs (i.e., non-matching faces) in the feature space. It does this by maximizing the distance between negative pairs and minimizing the distance between positive pairs, where the distance is measured using a Euclidean metric. The loss function is defined as:

L = (1/2) \* (y \* d(x_i, x_j) - d(x_i, x_j) + ε) + (1/2) \* (1 - y \* d(x_i, x_j) + ε)

where y is a binary label indicating whether the two faces are matching or non-matching, d(x_i, x_j) is the Euclidean distance between the two faces, and ε is a margin parameter that controls the separation between the positive and negative pairs. The goal of the contrastive loss function is to learn a representation that maximizes the similarity between matching faces and minimizes the similarity between non-matching faces",0.0599999964580002,0.0,0.0599999964580002,0.0015048651618265,7.762767000281594,6.249737909539513,0.0591016548463357,0.0099676724137931,0.1547834873199463,0.4100288091181296,0.1901268810033798,0.3824566304683685,0.0315731290742306,0.0,0.7334645980898843,0.7284237664474504

We fine-tune the inflated T2V models for One-Shot Video Generation. The objective of one-shot tuning is to acquire temporal knowledge from one training video, which is enabled by Sparse-Causal Attention (SC-Attn) and temporal self-attention (Temp-Attn). The SC-Attn models the one-way mapping from frame \mathbf{v}_{i} to its previous frames (i.e., \mathbf{v}_{1} and \mathbf{v}_{i-1}), and due to the causality, key and value features derived from previous frames are independent to the output of \mathbf{v}_{i}.Therefore, we propose to fix W^{K} and W^{V}, and only update W^{Q} in SC-Attn layers.On the other hand, we fine-tune the entire Temp-Attn layers, including W^{Q}, W^{K}, W^{V}, as they are newly added and randomly initialized.Moreover, we update the query projection in cross-attention (Cross-Attn) for better video-text alignment.Fine-tuning the attention blocks is computationally efficient, and keeps the property of diffusion-based T2I models unchanged.As shown in our experiments, this is sufficient to produce temporally-coherent videos with novel text prompts.Fig. 5 highlights the training pipeline and trainable parameters during the one-shot tuning process. As mentioned in Sec. 3.3, the VDM baselines [17, 14] factorize space and time by appending an additional temporal attention after each spatial attention block in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, the original 2D spatial blocks are kept in space only, and additional temporal convolution/attention blocks are added after the spatial layers to capture time-related information. For a fair comparison, we adopt the same training pipeline in Fig. 5 to fine-tune the VDM baselines for One-Shot Video Generation. As shown in Fig. 8, the VDM baselines with factorized space-time attention fail to generate consistent content (compare the appearance of the subjects across frames), whereas our Tune-A-Video with spatio-temporal cross-frame attention maintains better temporal consistency.

We use Wiki-40B, a multilingual language modeling dataset that covers 41 languages Guo et al. (2020). Following the Wiki-40B paper, we report bits per character (BPC) to allow comparison between models with different tokenizations of the text. We find that both BERT models perform notably worse on modeling other languages; however, RoBERTa, reduces the gap with the multilingual models from 2.51 BPC to 0.87 BPC (Figure 1(a)). This finding is consistent with Tran (2020), who also found RoBERTa transfers well cross-lingually. We first consider the performance of the encoders when probed for POS knowledge (Figure 1(b)).444For T5, this means that we evaluate the output of the encoder and discard the decoder. Unsurprisingly, on average all of the English models underperform the multilingual models.

359,Are English pretrained language models good at transfer to other language?,"Recent work has claimed that monolingual pretrained models are also surprisingly good at transferring between languages, despite ostensibly having never seen the target language before (Gogoulou et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021, inter alia).However, because of the large scale of pretraining data and because many pretraining corpora are not publicly available, it is currently unknown how much foreign language data exists in monolingual pretraining corpora.In this paper, we show that (1) these data are almost certainly contaminated with very small percentages of text from other languages and that (2) cross-lingual transfer is possible from such data leakage in the pretraining corpus. In this paper, we demonstrate that English pretrained models are exposed to a considerable amount of non-English data during pretraining, particularly in the case of more recent models that are trained on larger corpora derived from web crawls. We also find that this non-English text acts as a significant source of signal for cross-lingual transfer. Prior work has also shown the ability of monolingual models to transfer to other languages across a wide range of tasks Gogoulou et al. (2021); Li et al. (2021); Tran (2020); Artetxe et al. (2020); Chi et al. (2020), but these works do not consider the effect of foreign language data leakage as a source of signal. Notably, de Souza et al.

360,Why the authors suggest there is no truly monolingual pre-trained model?,"In this paper, we demonstrate that English pretrained models are exposed to a considerable amount of non-English data during pretraining, particularly in the case of more recent models that are trained on larger corpora derived from web crawls. We also find that this non-English text acts as a significant source of signal for cross-lingual transfer. We also only consider the effect of foreign language contamination for English pretrained models. It is unclear to what extent this phenomenon affects monolingual models for other languages; however, since many of the resources evaluated in this work are also used to pretrain non-English monolingual models (e.g., Wikipedia), similar effects would likely be observed. Overall, these results indicate that the considered models are actually multilingual and that their ability to transfer across languages is not zero-shot, despite what has been recently claimed.Given the effort required to fully remove all non-English data, we question whether it is practically possible to train truly monolingual models at scale.",Well-known pre-training resources already include multilingual data.,"Neither.

Secondly, RoBERTa’s subword vocabulary is robust to unexpected inputs and does not substitute an UNK token any input tokens; in contrast, T5 and BERT have high rates of UNK tokens for some non-Latin languages (Appendix B).555UNK tokens refer to placeholder tokens used when the model receives an input not covered by its vocabulary.However, for many high-resource languages the English models perform competitively, with T5 outperforming mBERT on German and Portuguese, among others.","T5 data contains 0.26%, and RoBERTa data contains 0.78%.","Sure!

370,What is used for measure the quantities of non-English data?,"We also see that non-English text makes up small percentages of the overall data, though this still leads to millions of tokens in large datasets.The largest individual languages after English only make up 0.01%, 0.15%, and 0.05% of the BERT, RoBERTa, and T5 training data, respectively.Multilingual pretraining work has shown that models generalize to new languages from varying amounts of data Delvin (2019); Lample and Conneau (2019); Conneau et al. (2020); however, these approaches intentionally select data across languages, and most upsample low-resource languages during training.Without these considerations, it is an open question how well the models trained on these relatively small amounts of non-English data generalize. We also perform a closer analysis on a random subset (200 per corpus) of non-English lines predicted by the language classifier (Table 1). Each example is manually coded into one of six categories.

2. Limited ability to handle rare words: Phrase-based systems often struggle to translate rare words or words with multiple meanings, leading to inaccurate or incomplete translations.
3. Inability to handle long-range dependencies: Phrase-based systems typically process the input text in a sequential manner, making it difficult for them to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information.

376,What are tasks to show how well English models tend to be multilingual?,"We now ask: how well do models pretrained on these putatively English corpora perform on non-English tasks? While the English data is more multilingual than previously thought, there are many differences between monolingual and multilingual pretraining; non-English data are often tokenized into more subword units333For example, the Basque UD treebank requires on average 1.78, 2.59, and 2.66 tokens per word to be encoded by XLMR, RoBERTa, and BERT, respectively.and are much less frequently observed during monolingual training.

(2020), a single LM module iteratively and exhaustively derives all conclusions based on the facts and rules, and then the goal statement is checked against the final set of conclusions to confirm if it can be proved from the theory. Since exhaustively deriving all conclusions is computationally expensive, Creswell et al. (2022) consider an alternative approach with two modules: 1- selection, which, guided by the goal, selects a subset of the facts and rules from which new conclusions can be derived toward proving the goal, and 2- inference, which takes the selected facts and rules and derives a new conclusion. The two modules are called iteratively until a halting criterion is met. In this paper, we compare against the second approach. In this paper, we argue and show experimentally that BC is better suited for text-based deductive logical reasoning, as it does not require large combinatorial searches for subset selection and it has more natural halting criteria.

391,"Are the results similar for other variants of values, given test set has only 1000 examples?","For higher depths (3+), on the three datasets SI produces predictions that are close to the majority class prediction. We find that it tends to over-predict Disproved in the binary case and Unknown in the three-way classification case (cf.

392,Doesn’t the possibility of having many rules make it ambiguous?,"In the case where we succeed in proving the antecedent of r, whether the goal is proved or disproved depends on whether the sign of the goal agrees or disagrees with the sign of the consequent of r. For instance, in Example 2, for the goal ‘‘Fiona is red?’’, since the sign of the goal agreed with the sign of the consequent of the second rule and the antecedent of the rule was proved, we concluded that the goal is proved. However, if the second rule was ‘‘Rough, nice people are not red.’’, then the sign of the goal would disagree with the sign of the consequent and so we would conclude that the goal is disproved. This motivates the fourth module, Sign Agreement, described next. The above results show that the Rule Selection and Goal Decomposition modules are responsible for the majority of the failure cases. Note that it is possible that the Rule Selection module fails for some examples but Lambada still arrives at the correct conclusion and proof. For the theory and goal in Example 1, for example, if there was another rule whose consequent was ‘‘being red’’ and the Rule Selection module failed to select that rule, Lambada would still arrive at the correct proof and prediction.","No, the possibility of having many rules does not make it ambiguous.",The range of the number of parameters for the models used in the study is from 5 thousand to 160 million,0.1333333285333335,0.0,0.1333333285333335,2.04834890794109,13.19334462488338,11.170554910010734,0.0680272108843537,0.0109318063508589,0.0875458344817161,0.3076507998335267,0.0875457972288131,0.2393245846033096,0.0086753704902936,,0.7662990847365161,0.7556803426863664

(2020); Creswell et al. (2022). FC requires selecting a subset of facts and rules from the entire set which might be difficult for an LM as it requires a combinatorial search over a large space.Moreover, deciding when to halt and declare failure to prove is challenging in FC Creswell et al.

To reduce computational cost.

Since exhaustively deriving all conclusions is computationally expensive, Creswell et al. (2022) consider an alternative approach with two modules: 1- selection, which, guided by the goal, selects a subset of the facts and rules from which new conclusions can be derived toward proving the goal, and 2- inference, which takes the selected facts and rules and derives a new conclusion.

397,Did the authors use commonly used one-vs-all scheme for extending DeepFool method to the multiclass case?,"We now extend the DeepFool algorithm to the general case of multiclass differentiable classifiers. For general non-linear classifiers, the set P in Eq. (7) that describes the region of the space where the classifier outputs label \hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0}) is no longer a polyhedron.

Specifically, at each iteration of the algorithm, the perturbation vector that reaches the boundary of the polyhedron \tilde{P}_{i} is computed, and the current estimate updated.The method is given in Algorithm 2. It should be noted that the proposed algorithm operates in a greedy way and is not guaranteed to converge to the optimal perturbation in (1). However, we have observed in practice that our algorithm yields very small perturbations which are believed to be good approximations of the minimal perturbation.  We now extend the DeepFool method to the multiclass case. The most common used scheme for multiclass classifiers is one-vs-all. Hence, we also propose our method based on this classification scheme. In this scheme, the classifier has c outputs where c is the number of classes. Therefore, a classifier can be defined as f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{c} and the classification is done by the following mapping:\hat{k}(\bm{x})=\operatorname*{arg\,max}_{k}f_{k}(\bm{x}),(5)where f_{k}(\bm{x}) is the output of f(\bm{x}) that corresponds to the k^{\text{th}} class.Similarly to the binary case, we first present the proposed approach for the linear case and then we generalize it to other classifiers.","Yes, the authors use the common one-vs-all scheme \hat{k}(\bm{x})=\operatorname*{arg\,max}_{k}f_{k}(\bm{x}).","Sure!

398,How is the authors' work different from the “fast gradient sign” method?,"We compare the proposed DeepFool approach to state-of-the-art techniques to compute adversarial perturbations in [18] and [4]. The method in [18] solves a series of penalized optimization problems to find the minimal perturbation, whereas [4] estimates the minimal perturbation by taking the sign of the gradient\displaystyle\hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x})=\epsilon\,\text{sign}\left(\nabla_{\bm{x}}J(\bm{\theta},\bm{x},y)\right),with J the cost used to train the neural network, \bm{\theta} is the model parameters, and y is the label of \bm{x}. The method is called fast gradient sign method. In practice, in the absence of general rules to choose the parameter \epsilon, we chose the smallest \epsilon such that 90\% of the data are misclassified after perturbation.555Using this method, we observed empirically that one cannot reach 100\% misclassification rate on some datasets. In fact, even by increasing \epsilon to be very large, this method can fail in misclassifying all samples. It can be seen that DeepFool estimates smaller perturbations (hence closer to minimal perturbation defined in (1)) than the ones computed using the competitive approaches. For example, the average perturbation obtained using DeepFool is 5 times lower than the one estimated with [4]. On the ILSVRC2012 challenge dataset, the average perturbation is one order of magnitude smaller compared to the fast gradient method. It should be noted moreover that the proposed approach also yields slightly smaller perturbation vectors than the method in [18]. The proposed approach is hence more accurate in detecting directions that can potentially fool neural networks. As a result, DeepFool can be used as a valuable tool to accurately assess the robustness of classifiers.On the complexity aspect, the proposed approach is substantially faster than the standard method proposed in [18].In fact, while the approach [18] involves a costly minimization of a series of objective functions, we observed empirically that DeepFool converges in a few iterations (i.e., less than 3) to a perturbation vector that fools the classifier. Hence, the proposed approach reaches a more accurate perturbation vector compared to state-of-the-art methods, while being computationally efficient. This makes it readily suitable to be used as a baseline method to estimate the robustness of very deep neural networks on large-scale datasets. In that context, we provide the first quantitative evaluation of the robustness of state-of-the-art classifiers on the large-scale ImageNet dataset. It can be seen that despite their very good test accuracy, these methods are extremely unstable to adversarial perturbations: a perturbation that is 1000 smaller in magnitude than the original image is sufficient to fool state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We illustrate in Figure 1 perturbed images generated by the fast gradient sign and DeepFool. It can be observed that the proposed method generates adversarial perturbations which are hardly perceptible, while the fast gradient sign method outputs a perturbation image with higher norm. In this section, we fine-tune the networks of Table 1 on adversarial examples to build more robust classifiers for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. Specifically, for each network, we performed two experiments: (i) Fine-tuning the network on DeepFool’s adversarial examples, (ii) Fine-tuning the network on the fast gradient sign adversarial examples.We fine-tune the networks by performing 5 additional epochs, with a 50\% decreased learning rate only on the perturbed training set. For each experiment, the same training data was used through all 5 extra epochs. For the sake of completeness, we also performed 5 extra epochs on the original data. The evolution of \hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}} for the different fine-tuning strategies is shown in Figures 5(a) to 5(d), where the robustness \hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}} is estimated using DeepFool, since this is the most accurate method, as shown in Table 1. Observe that fine-tuning with DeepFool adversarial examples significantly increases the robustness of the networks to adversarial perturbations even after one extra epoch. For example, the robustness of the networks on MNIST is improved by 50% and NIN’s robustness is increased by about 40%. On the other hand, quite surprisingly, the method in [4] can lead to a decreased robustness to adversarial perturbations of the network. We hypothesize that this behavior is due to the fact that perturbations estimated using the fast gradient sign method are much larger than minimal adversarial perturbations. Fine-tuning the network with overly perturbed images decreases the robustness of the networks to adversarial perturbations.To verify this hypothesis, we compare in Figure 7 the adversarial robustness of a network that is fine-tuned with the adversarial examples obtained using DeepFool, where norms of perturbations have been deliberately multiplied by \alpha=1,2,3. Interestingly, we see that by magnifying the norms of the adversarial perturbations, the robustness of the fine-tuned network is decreased. This might explain why overly perturbed images decrease the robustness of MNIST networks: these perturbations can really change the class of the digits, hence fine-tuning based on these examples can lead to a drop of the robustness (for an illustration, see Figure 8). This lends credence to our hypothesis, and further shows the importance of designing accurate methods to compute minimal perturbations. Table 3 lists the accuracies of the fine-tuned networks. It can be seen that fine-tuning with DeepFool can improve the accuracy of the networks. Conversely, fine-tuning with the approach in [4] has led to a decrease of the test accuracy in all our experiments. This confirms the explanation that the fast gradient sign method outputs overly perturbed images that lead to images that are unlikely to occur in the test data. Hence, it decreases the performance of the method as it acts as a regularizer that does not represent the distribution of the original data. This effect is analogous to geometric data augmentation schemes, where large transformations of the original samples have a counter-productive effect on generalization.666While the authors of [4] reported an increased generalization performance on the MNIST task (from 0.94\% to 0.84\%) using adversarial regularization, it should be noted that the their experimental setup is significantly different as [4] trained the network based on a modified cost function, while we performed straightforward fine-tuning. To emphasize the importance of a correct estimation of the minimal perturbation, we now show that using approximate methods can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the adversarial robustness of networks. We fine-tune the NIN classifier on the fast gradient sign adversarial examples. We follow the procedure described earlier but this time, we decreased the learning rate by 90%. We have evaluated the adversarial robustness of this network at different extra epochs using DeepFool and the fast gradient sign method. As one can see in Figure 9, the red plot exaggerates the effect of training on the adversarial examples. Moreover, it is not sensitive enough to demonstrate the loss of robustness at the first extra epoch. These observations confirm that using an accurate tool to measure the robustness of classifiers is crucial to derive conclusions about the robustness of networks.  Our main contributions are the following:•We propose a simple yet accurate method for computing and comparing the robustness of different classifiers to adversarial perturbations.•We perform an extensive experimental comparison, and show that 1) our method computes adversarial perturbations more reliably and efficiently than existing methods 2) augmenting training data with adversarial examples significantly increases the robustness to adversarial perturbations.•We show that using imprecise approaches for the computation of adversarial perturbations could lead to different and sometimes misleading conclusions about the robustness. Hence, our method provides a better understanding of this intriguing phenomenon and of its influence factors.We now review some of the relevant work. The phenomenon of adversarial instability was first introduced and studied in [18]. The authors estimated adversarial examples by solving penalized optimization problems and presented an analysis showing that the high complexity of neural networks might be a reason explaining the presence of adversarial examples. Unfortunately, the optimization method employed in [18] is time-consuming and therefore does not scale to large datasets. In [14], the authors showed that convolutional networks are not invariant to some sort of transformations based on the experiments done on Pascal3D+ annotations. Recently, Tsai et al. [19] provided a software to misclassify a given image in a specified class, without necessarily finding the smallest perturbation. Nguyen et al. [13] generated synthetic unrecognizable images, which are classified with high confidence. The authors of [3] also studied a related problem of finding the minimal geometric transformation that fools image classifiers, and provided quantitative measure of the robustness of classifiers to geometric transformations. Closer to our work, the authors of [4] introduced the “fast gradient sign” method, which computes the adversarial perturbations for a given classifier very efficiently. Despite its efficiency, this method provides only a coarse approximation of the optimal perturbation vectors. In fact, it performs a unique gradient step, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions. Then in an attempt to build more robust classifiers to adversarial perturbations, [5] introduced a smoothness penalty in the training procedure that allows to boost the robustness of the classifier. Notably, the method in [18] was applied in order to generate adversarial perturbations. We should finally mention that the phenomenon of adversarial instability also led to theoretical work in [2] that studied the problem of adversarial perturbations on some families of classifiers, and provided upper bounds on the robustness of these classifiers. A deeper understanding of the phenomenon of adversarial instability for more complex classifiers is however needed; the method proposed in this work can be seen as a baseline to efficiently and accurately generate adversarial perturbations in order to better understand this phenomenon.","The fast gradient sign method is very quick but may lead to sub-optimal perturbations thus damaging the overall robustness estimation, and fine-tuning with such adversarial samples may sometimes result in a drop in the overall performance of the model. On the other hand, DeepFool creates adversarial perturbations that are closer to the absolute minimum compared to others thus giving us a more reliable tool in terms of robustness estimation and fine-tuning.","Sure, I can answer your questions based on the given context!

Using CLIP-based codes means using codes generated by the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to condition the image inversion process.

399,"What does an ""adversarial perturbation"" mean?","Deep neural networks are powerful learning models that achieve state-of-the-art pattern recognition performance in many research areas such as bioinformatics [1, 16], speech [12, 6], and computer vision [10, 8]. Though deep networks have exhibited very good performance in classification tasks, they have recently been shown to be particularly unstable to adversarial perturbations of the data [18]. In fact, very small and often imperceptible perturbations of the data samples are sufficient to fool state-of-the-art classifiers and result in incorrect classification. (e.g., Figure 1). Formally, for a given classifier, we define an adversarial perturbation as the minimal perturbation \bm{r} that is sufficient to change the estimated label \hat{k}(\bm{x}):\displaystyle\Delta(\bm{x};\hat{k}):=\min_{\bm{r}}\|\bm{r}\|_{2}\text{ subject to }\hat{k}(\bm{x}+\bm{r})\neq\hat{k}(\bm{x}),(1)where \bm{x} is an image and \hat{k}(\bm{x}) is the estimated label. We call \Delta(\bm{x};\hat{k}) the robustness of \hat{k} at point \bm{x}. The robustness of classifier \hat{k} is then defined as \rho_{\text{adv}}(\hat{k})=\mathbb{E}_{\bm{x}}\frac{\Delta(\bm{x};\hat{k})}{\|\bm{x}\|_{2}},(2)where \mathbb{E}_{\bm{x}} is the expectation over the distribution of data.The study of adversarial perturbations helps us understand what features are used by a classifier.The existence of such examples is seemingly in contradiction with the generalization ability of the learning algorithms. While deep networks achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks, they are not robust at all to small adversarial perturbations and tend to misclassify minimally perturbed data that looks visually similar to clean samples.Though adversarial attacks are specific to the classifier, it seems that the adversarial perturbations are generalizable across different models [18]. This can actually become a real concern from a security point of view. An accurate method for finding the adversarial perturbations is thus necessary to study and compare the robustness of different classifiers to adversarial perturbations. It might be the key to a better understanding of the limits of current architectures and to design methods to increase robustness. Despite the importance of the vulnerability of state-of-the-art classifiers to adversarial instability, no well-founded method has been proposed to compute adversarial perturbations and we fill this gap in this paper.",Adversarial perturbation is a small and unnoticeable change to the data that fool the given model (i.e give a different class after applying the perturbation).

400,What are the metrics used to compare the efficiency of different methods which compute the adversarial perturbations?,"In order to evaluate the robustness to adversarial perturbations of a classifier f, we compute the average robustness \hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}}(f), defined by\hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}}(f)=\frac{1}{|\mathscr{D}|}\sum_{\bm{x}\in\mathscr{D}}\frac{\|\hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x})\|_{2}}{\|\bm{x}\|_{2}},(15)where \hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x}) is the estimated minimal perturbation obtained using DeepFool, and \mathscr{D} denotes the test set444For ILSVRC2012, we used the validation data.. We report in Table 1 the accuracy and average robustness \hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}} of each classifier computed using different methods. We also show the running time required for each method to compute one adversarial sample. It should be noted that, when perturbations are measured using the \ell_{\infty} norm, the above conclusions remain unchanged: DeepFool yields adversarial perturbations that are smaller (hence closer to the optimum) compared to other methods for computing adversarial examples. Table 2 reports the \ell_{\infty} robustness to adversarial perturbations measured by \hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}}^{\infty}(f)=\frac{1}{|\mathscr{D}|}\sum_{\bm{x}\in\mathscr{D}}\frac{\|\hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x})\|_{\infty}}{\|\bm{x}\|_{\infty}}, where \hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x}) is computed respectively using DeepFool (with p=\infty, see Section 3.3), and the Fast gradient sign method for MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. To emphasize the importance of a correct estimation of the minimal perturbation, we now show that using approximate methods can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the adversarial robustness of networks. We fine-tune the NIN classifier on the fast gradient sign adversarial examples. We follow the procedure described earlier but this time, we decreased the learning rate by 90%. We have evaluated the adversarial robustness of this network at different extra epochs using DeepFool and the fast gradient sign method. As one can see in Figure 9, the red plot exaggerates the effect of training on the adversarial examples. Moreover, it is not sensitive enough to demonstrate the loss of robustness at the first extra epoch. These observations confirm that using an accurate tool to measure the robustness of classifiers is crucial to derive conclusions about the robustness of networks.

401,"What does an ""affine classifier"" mean?","Let f(\bm{x}) be an affine classifier, i.e., f(\bm{x})=\mathbf{W}^{\top}\bm{x}+\bm{b} for a given \mathbf{W} and \bm{b}. Since the mapping \hat{k} is the outcome of a one-vs-all classification scheme, the minimal perturbation to fool the classifier can be rewritten as follows\begin{split}&\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\bm{r}}\|\bm{r}\|_{2}\\&\text{s.t. }\exists k:\bm{w}_{k}^{\top}(\bm{x}_{0}+\bm{r})+b_{k}\geq\bm{w}_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}^{\top}(\bm{x}_{0}+\bm{r})+b_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})},\end{split}(6)where \bm{w}_{k} is the k^{\text{th}} column of \mathbf{W}. Geometrically, the above problem corresponds to the computation of the distance between \bm{x}_{0} and the complement of the convex polyhedron P,\displaystyle P=\bigcap_{k=1}^{c}\{\bm{x}:f_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}(\bm{x})\geq f_{k}(\bm{x})\},(7)where \bm{x}_{0} is located inside P.We denote this distance by \text{{dist}}(\bm{x}_{0},P^{c}).The polyhedron P defines the region of the space where f outputs the label \hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0}). This setting is depicted in Figure 4. The solution to the problem in Eq. (6) can be computed in closed form as follows. Define \hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0}) to be the closest hyperplane of the boundary of P (e.g. \hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0})=3 in Figure 4). Formally, \hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0}) can be computed as follows\hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0})=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{k\neq{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}}\frac{\left|f_{k}(\bm{x}_{0})-f_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}(\bm{x}_{0})\right|}{\|\bm{w}_{k}-\bm{w}_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}\|_{2}}.(8)The minimum perturbation \bm{r}_{*}(\bm{x}_{0}) is the vector that projects \bm{x}_{0} on the hyperplane indexed by \hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0}), i.e.,\bm{r}_{*}(\bm{x}_{0})=\frac{\left|f_{\hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0})}(\bm{x}_{0})-f_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}(\bm{x}_{0})\right|}{\|\bm{w}_{\hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0})}-\bm{w}_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}\|_{2}^{2}}(\bm{w}_{\hat{l}(\bm{x}_{0})}-\bm{w}_{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}).(9)In other words, we find the closest projection of \bm{x}_{0} on faces of P. As a multiclass classifier can be viewed as aggregation of binary classifiers, we first propose the algorithm for binary classifiers.That is, we assume here \hat{k}(\bm{x})=\text{sign}(f(\bm{x})), where f is an arbitrary scalar-valued image classification function f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}. We also denote by \mathscr{F}\triangleq\{\bm{x}:f(\bm{x})=0\} the level set at zero of f.We begin by analyzing the case where f is an affine classifier f(\bm{x})=\bm{w}^{T}\bm{x}+b, and then derive the general algorithm, which can be applied to any differentiable binary classifier f.","The affine classifier is the classifier in the form of an affine function.

403,"The paper's algorithm yields very small perturbations which are believed to be good approximations of the minimal perturbation. Quantitatively, how far is the paper's approximation from the minimal perturbation?","It can be seen that DeepFool estimates smaller perturbations (hence closer to minimal perturbation defined in (1)) than the ones computed using the competitive approaches. For example, the average perturbation obtained using DeepFool is 5 times lower than the one estimated with [4]. On the ILSVRC2012 challenge dataset, the average perturbation is one order of magnitude smaller compared to the fast gradient method. It should be noted moreover that the proposed approach also yields slightly smaller perturbation vectors than the method in [18]. The proposed approach is hence more accurate in detecting directions that can potentially fool neural networks. As a result, DeepFool can be used as a valuable tool to accurately assess the robustness of classifiers.On the complexity aspect, the proposed approach is substantially faster than the standard method proposed in [18].In fact, while the approach [18] involves a costly minimization of a series of objective functions, we observed empirically that DeepFool converges in a few iterations (i.e., less than 3) to a perturbation vector that fools the classifier. Hence, the proposed approach reaches a more accurate perturbation vector compared to state-of-the-art methods, while being computationally efficient. This makes it readily suitable to be used as a baseline method to estimate the robustness of very deep neural networks on large-scale datasets. In that context, we provide the first quantitative evaluation of the robustness of state-of-the-art classifiers on the large-scale ImageNet dataset. It can be seen that despite their very good test accuracy, these methods are extremely unstable to adversarial perturbations: a perturbation that is 1000 smaller in magnitude than the original image is sufficient to fool state-of-the-art deep neural networks. It should be noted that, when perturbations are measured using the \ell_{\infty} norm, the above conclusions remain unchanged: DeepFool yields adversarial perturbations that are smaller (hence closer to the optimum) compared to other methods for computing adversarial examples. Table 2 reports the \ell_{\infty} robustness to adversarial perturbations measured by \hat{\rho}_{\text{adv}}^{\infty}(f)=\frac{1}{|\mathscr{D}|}\sum_{\bm{x}\in\mathscr{D}}\frac{\|\hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x})\|_{\infty}}{\|\bm{x}\|_{\infty}}, where \hat{\bm{r}}(\bm{x}) is computed respectively using DeepFool (with p=\infty, see Section 3.3), and the Fast gradient sign method for MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. Our main contributions are the following:•We propose a simple yet accurate method for computing and comparing the robustness of different classifiers to adversarial perturbations.•We perform an extensive experimental comparison, and show that 1) our method computes adversarial perturbations more reliably and efficiently than existing methods 2) augmenting training data with adversarial examples significantly increases the robustness to adversarial perturbations.•We show that using imprecise approaches for the computation of adversarial perturbations could lead to different and sometimes misleading conclusions about the robustness. Hence, our method provides a better understanding of this intriguing phenomenon and of its influence factors.We now review some of the relevant work. The phenomenon of adversarial instability was first introduced and studied in [18]. The authors estimated adversarial examples by solving penalized optimization problems and presented an analysis showing that the high complexity of neural networks might be a reason explaining the presence of adversarial examples. Unfortunately, the optimization method employed in [18] is time-consuming and therefore does not scale to large datasets. In [14], the authors showed that convolutional networks are not invariant to some sort of transformations based on the experiments done on Pascal3D+ annotations. Recently, Tsai et al. [19] provided a software to misclassify a given image in a specified class, without necessarily finding the smallest perturbation. Nguyen et al. [13] generated synthetic unrecognizable images, which are classified with high confidence. The authors of [3] also studied a related problem of finding the minimal geometric transformation that fools image classifiers, and provided quantitative measure of the robustness of classifiers to geometric transformations. Closer to our work, the authors of [4] introduced the “fast gradient sign” method, which computes the adversarial perturbations for a given classifier very efficiently. Despite its efficiency, this method provides only a coarse approximation of the optimal perturbation vectors. In fact, it performs a unique gradient step, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions. Then in an attempt to build more robust classifiers to adversarial perturbations, [5] introduced a smoothness penalty in the training procedure that allows to boost the robustness of the classifier. Notably, the method in [18] was applied in order to generate adversarial perturbations. We should finally mention that the phenomenon of adversarial instability also led to theoretical work in [2] that studied the problem of adversarial perturbations on some families of classifiers, and provided upper bounds on the robustness of these classifiers. A deeper understanding of the phenomenon of adversarial instability for more complex classifiers is however needed; the method proposed in this work can be seen as a baseline to efficiently and accurately generate adversarial perturbations in order to better understand this phenomenon. In practice, the above algorithm can often converge to a point on the zero level set \mathscr{F}. In order to reach the other side of the classification boundary, the final perturbation vector \hat{\bm{r}} is multiplied by a constant 1+\eta, with \eta\ll 1. In our experiments, we have used \eta=0.02.  It should be noted that the optimization strategy of DeepFool is strongly tied to existing optimization techniques. In the binary case, it can be seen as Newton’s iterative algorithm for finding roots of a nonlinear system of equations in the underdetermined case [15]. This algorithm is known as the normal flow method. The convergence analysis of this optimization technique can be found for example in [21]. Our algorithm in the binary case can alternatively be seen as a gradient descent algorithm with an adaptive step size that is automatically chosen at each iteration. The linearization in Algorithm 2 is also similar to a sequential convex programming where the constraints are linearized at each step.","The authors only claim that the DeepFool can be used as a baseline for adversarial perturbation calculation and that it heavily depends on existing optimization methods. In the paper, its effectiveness is proven relative to other state-of-the-art methods. Although the analysis of how far the estimated perturbation from the actual minimal perturbation can be found in referenced papers, the more sophisticated analysis is not mentioned in the paper.

404,Why did the authors choose a greedy approach for general classifier?,"We then approximate, at iteration i, the distance between xi and the complement of P , dist(xi, P c), by dist(xi,  ̃P c i ). Specifically, at each iteration of the algorithm, the perturbation vector that reaches the boundary of the polyhedron  ̃Pi is computed, and the current estimate updated. The method is given in Algorithm 2. It should be noted that the proposed algorithm operates in a greedy way and is not guaranteed to converge to the optimal perturbation in (1). However, we have observed in practice that our algorithm yields very small perturbations which are believed to be good approximations of the minimal perturbation.

405,Which deep neural network architectures were used for experimental comparison of DeepFool algorithm with existing methods?,"We now test our DeepFool algorithm on deep convolutional neural networks architectures applied to MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet image classification datasets. We consider the following deep neural network architectures:•MNIST: A two-layer fully connected network, and a two-layer LeNet convoluational neural network architecture [9]. Both networks are trained with SGD with momentum using the MatConvNet [20] package.•CIFAR-10: We trained a three-layer LeNet architecture, as well as a Network In Network (NIN) architecture [11].•ILSVRC 2012: We used CaffeNet [7] and GoogLeNet [17] pre-trained models. In this work, we proposed an algorithm, DeepFool, to compute adversarial examples that fool state-of-the-art classifiers. It is based on an iterative linearization of the classifier to generate minimal perturbations that are sufficient to change classification labels. We provided extensive experimental evidence on three datasets and eight classifiers, showing the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods to compute adversarial perturbations, as well as the efficiency of the proposed approach. Due to its accurate estimation of the adversarial perturbations, the proposed DeepFool algorithm provides an efficient and accurate way to evaluate the robustness of classifiers and to enhance their performance by proper fine-tuning.The proposed approach can therefore be used as a reliable tool to accurately estimate the minimal perturbation vectors, and build more robust classifiers.","Although the conclusion of the paper claims that 8 different classifiers were used, we can only see 6 classifiers with different datasets: 2-layer fully-connected network (MNIST), 2-layer LeNet (MNIST), 3-layer LeNet (CIFAR-10), NIN (CIFAR-10), CaffeNet (ILSVRC 2012), and GoogLeNet (ILSVRC 2012).","A synset is a set of words or phrases with similar meanings, as defined in WordNet",0.0816326486630573,0.0,0.0816326486630573,0.7104889092469343,16.272385037803264,13.802075050338436,0.0265017667844522,0.0039840637450199,0.2081821113824844,0.3975106216115984,0.2081820666790008,0.2151698321104049,0.0090531951578328,,0.6970282134521106,0.7219202478416631
406,Why did the authors measure the perturbations using the L`2 norm?,"In this paper, we have measured the perturbations using the \ell_{2} norm. Our framework is however not limited to this choice, and the proposed algorithm can simply be adapted to find minimal adversarial perturbations for any \ell_{p} norm (p\in[1,\infty)). To do so, the update steps in line 10 and 11 in Algorithm 2 must be respectively substituted by the following updates\displaystyle\hat{l}\displaystyle\leftarrow\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{k\neq{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}}\frac{\left|f^{\prime}_{k}\right|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{k}\|_{q}},(11)\displaystyle\bm{r}_{i}\displaystyle\leftarrow\frac{|f^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}\|_{q}^{q}}|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}|^{q-1}\odot\text{sign}(\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}),(12)where \odot is the pointwise product and q=\frac{p}{p-1}.333To see this, one can apply Holder’s inequality to obtain a lower bound on the \ell_{p} norm of the perturbation. In particular, when p=\infty (i.e., the supremum norm \ell_{\infty}), these update steps become\displaystyle\hat{l}\displaystyle\leftarrow\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{k\neq{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}}\frac{\left|f^{\prime}_{k}\right|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{k}\|_{1}},(13)\displaystyle\bm{r}_{i}\displaystyle\leftarrow\frac{|f^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}\|_{1}}\text{sign}(\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}).(14) An accurate method for finding the adversarial perturbations is thus necessary to study and compare the robustness of different classifiers to adversarial perturbations.

To do so, the update steps in line 10 and 11 in Algorithm 2 must be respectively substituted by the following updates\displaystyle\hat{l}\displaystyle\leftarrow\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{k\neq{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}}\frac{\left|f^{\prime}_{k}\right|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{k}\|_{q}},(11)\displaystyle\bm{r}_{i}\displaystyle\leftarrow\frac{|f^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}\|_{q}^{q}}|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}|^{q-1}\odot\text{sign}(\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}),(12)where \odot is the pointwise product and q=\frac{p}{p-1}.333To see this, one can apply Holder’s inequality to obtain a lower bound on the \ell_{p} norm of the perturbation. In particular, when p=\infty (i.e., the supremum norm \ell_{\infty}), these update steps become\displaystyle\hat{l}\displaystyle\leftarrow\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{k\neq{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}}\frac{\left|f^{\prime}_{k}\right|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{k}\|_{1}},(13)\displaystyle\bm{r}_{i}\displaystyle\leftarrow\frac{|f^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}\|_{1}}\text{sign}(\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}).(14)","To adapt the algorithm to use any l-p norm, only 2 lines in the algorithm (10 and 11) should be substituted with \displaystyle\hat{l}\displaystyle\leftarrow\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{k\neq{\hat{k}(\bm{x}_{0})}}\frac{\left|f^{\prime}_{k}\right|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{k}\|_{q}},(11)\displaystyle\bm{r}_{i}\displaystyle\leftarrow\frac{|f^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}|}{\|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}\|_{q}^{q}}|\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}|^{q-1}\odot\text{sign}(\bm{w}^{\prime}_{\hat{l}}), where q = p/(p-1).","Sure!

409,What are the possible reason androgenetic alopecia or MPB is less severe in women as compared to men?,"Alopecia, folliculitis, and psoriasis are some common causes of hair loss. There is a difference between regular hair fall and alopecia; the latter develops coin-sized bald patches all over the scalp area. Alopecia or patchy hair loss can be of different types. Androgenetic alopecia or male-pattern baldness (MPB) is the most common form of alopecia where the hairline starts to recede, following a pattern where the frontal and temple area are most affected. 70% of men and 40% of women get this type of hair loss and thinning issue [3]. According to Liu et al., MPB is an X-linked polygenic disease, and males are more genetically prone to develop baldness at a mature age [5]. Topical minoxidil solution thickens the hair by 50% [3]. On the other hand, Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease affecting individuals irrespective of age and sex. Primarily affecting the scalp area, AA can also spread in the beard, eyelashes, and eyebrows. In this case, the body’s immune cells cannot recognize hair follicles as ‘self.’ Instead, they consider these follicles as ‘foreign,’ which ultimately causes the hair follicles to be","MPB is an X-linked polygenic

412,According to the author most hair and scalp disease is diagnosed in advanced stages. What could be the possible reason behind this ? How can we sensitize people for early diagnosis of hair disease?,"Some scalp infections may be treatable if diagnosed early. Some but not all diseases may go on their own. Only an expert physician can detect the illness by visual observation. In some cases, early disease detection is beneficial for dermatologists to initiate the treatment. An early scalp inspection includes a dermatoscopic examination of the scalp for inflammation, itching, localized lesion, dandruff, follicular flakes, louse eggs (nits), and a scalp biopsy. Besides visual observation, the patient can undergo blood and hormone tests to detect the exact disease. Unfortunately, most hair and scalp diseases are diagnosed in advanced stages, which complicate the treatment options. All these factors lengthen the diagnosis and treatment process. Therefore, researchers are putting more effort into developing different mechanisms for the early detection of hair and scalp diseases. Disease detection using machine learning approaches is gaining popularity in health informatics. Many skin and scalp-related diseases can be detected using images of infected regions within a few seconds. In one study by Choudhary et al. [18], a framework is developed to differentiate alopecia areata from healthy hair. They obtained 200 healthy hair images from the figaro1K dataset and 68 alopecia areata hair images from DermNet. After a series of enhancement and segmentation, three key features were Although early-stage detection of hair and scalp-related diseases is the key to the treatment process, hair loss and scalp diseases can often go undetected due to a lack of awareness and a lengthy diagnosis test.

After using 70% of the data to train the model, we analyzed remaining 30% of images for testing our model. After subsequent training, the model gave an overall 96.2% training accuracy on the training data and 91.1% validation accuracy for the test data, with a high precision and recall scores for each disease type. We have also provided our dataset with this study.

416,How does the author conclude that non-local means filter is the best filter for denoising the images ? Are there any other filters that can be used for the same task?,"Noise is the degradation of image signals caused by external sources [23]. Noise introduces random variations of brightness or color information in the captured images. Most of the time, images on the internet have some noise associated with them. As we have collected most of the data samples from different dermatology websites, the noise in our dataset is not homogeneously distributed, which made it more complex. Therefore, we applied additional filters for denoising the collected images. We started with the gaussian filter for a better image classification process. However, after using the gaussian filter, the images become completely blurred, which leads to the loss of important information and damage to the edges. We then applied the median filter, which worked better than the gaussian filter with kernel_size = 3. Though we achieved better accuracy using the bilateral filter, we got the best results while applying the non-local means filter with patch_size = 3 and patch_distance = 5.

417,How CLAHE is better than HE for image equalization?,"extracted from the images: texture, shape, and color. The researchers divided the dataset into 70%-30% train-test-split and applied a support vector machine (SNM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) for the classification task. Overall, they achieved 91.4% and 88.9% accuracy using SVM and KNN, respectively, with a 10-fold cross-validation approach. However, using other machine learning algorithms might increase in the accuracy rate, which should have been discussed. Besides, the application of Histogram Equalization (HE) for image enhancement complicated the process of getting accurate texture features from distorted images, as HE itself adds noise to the output image, distorting the signals. Moreover, this study only shed light on alopecia areata disease, ignoring the inter-class differences between other similar type diseases, which increased the likelihood of inaccurate prediction of other diseases as alopecia areata, thereby making this framework less reliable. Often the captured image doesn’t reflect the natural view and needs contrast enhancement to meet the level of realistic view [24]. Especially images with high color depth and after denoising effects need normalization for a better realistic view [25]. First, we applied histogram equalization (HE). However, the HE increases the contrast of the background when used in images with low color depth, and information is lost as the histogram is not confined to the local region. To overcome the problem, we applied CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) by dividing an image into equal size non-overlapping areas and computing a histogram for each region. After clipping the histogram, we distributed the clipped value over the histogram equalization, which gives us control of the over-amplification of the contrast and generates the resultant image shown in Fig. 4.","Input image gets high contrast when pass through HE and hence loose information by adding noise.

418,What is 'autokeras' ? How it works?,"In this study, CNN is utilized for classification because it takes image’s raw pixel data, trains a model, and extracts the features automatically for better detection. We used autokeras to find the best model for this problem.

For training the model, we used batch_size = 16 with 50 epochs for each batch. The preprocessed data is divided into 70-30 train-test-split for training and validation purpose. Our model consists of 256 inputs, 3 x 3 square kernel, 3 output units and a softmax output. We used ReLU as our activation function to prevent the exponential growth of required computation and to explore the non-linear relationship between input and output variables. After each convolutional layer, input goes through the pooling layer having 2 x 2 kernel size to reduce the dimensions of the features map.

423,Why in the case of Alopecia areata the body's immune cell can't recognise hair follicle as 'self?,"Alopecia, folliculitis, and psoriasis are some common causes of hair loss. There is a difference between regular hair fall and alopecia; the latter develops coin-sized bald patches all over the scalp area. Alopecia or patchy hair loss can be of different types. Androgenetic alopecia or male-pattern baldness (MPB) is the most common form of alopecia where the hairline starts to recede, following a pattern where the frontal and temple area are most affected. 70% of men and 40% of women get this type of hair loss and thinning issue [3]. According to Liu et al., MPB is an X-linked polygenic disease, and males are more genetically prone to develop baldness at a mature age [5]. Topical minoxidil solution thickens the hair by 50% [3]. On the other hand, Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease affecting individuals irrespective of age and sex. Primarily affecting the scalp area, AA can also spread in the beard, eyelashes, and eyebrows. In this case, the body’s immune cells cannot recognize hair follicles as ‘self.’ Instead, they consider these follicles as ‘foreign,’ which ultimately causes the hair follicles to be targeted and destroyed by the immune cells. It is an example of a hereditary disease. The study from Benigno et al. reported that, in the US alone, 700,000 individuals suffer from AA [6]. This disease, if diagnosed early, might resolve spontaneously. In severe cases, topical corticosteroid or immune therapy is used.","Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease where the body’s immune cells cannot recognize hair follicles as ‘self.’ Instead, they consider these follicles as ‘foreign'. It is an example of a hereditary disease. But the paper didn't fully discussed why the cell can't recognise hair follicle as 'self'. Therefore the question cannot be answered fully.","The variations in camera poses for the different robots were determined using a combination of wear and tear, object interactions, and slightly different camera poses relative to the robot base",0.0869565171182527,0.0,0.057971009871876,0.8460324006355521,23.37134981422265,19.182551012035365,0.0507982583454281,0.005736137667304,-0.0194925740361213,0.3807703412887526,0.0383378751575946,0.1988110691308975,0.0049485697056688,0.0,0.7019415359775216,0.6824584691620007

425,What is difference between CNN and D-CNN?,"CNN has built a model of the human brain using the mixture of these networks. CNN layers are organized so that simpler patterns (lines, curves, etc.) are detected initially and more complicated patterns (faces, objects, etc.) are detected afterwards. However, CNN has drawn a lot of interest in data science since it has demonstrated its ability to locate, segment, and identify objects in images. In this study, the term ""original CNN architecture"" refers to a CNN network and algorithm that are available on Keras or Github. In this study, the CNN algorithm is used exactly as its creators and programmers intended it to be, with no modifications to its processing units, parameterization and hyper-parameter optimization methodologies, design patterns, or layer connections. A well-known CNN network was frequently created and improved by several researchers and programmers over the course of numerous difficulties. Deep learning is a crucial artificial intelligence tool for solving many complicated computer vision problems. Image categorization uses deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) problems. Such models work best with lots of data. Because professional clinicians must classify each image, obtaining such a large volume of labeled data for biomedical image classification tasks is expensive and time-consuming. Transfer learning circumvents this issue. This method applies network weights from a model trained on a large dataset to a small dataset problem. Biomedical image categorization often uses CNN models trained on ImageNet, which has over 14 million images. Data scientists have been drawn to the concept of utilizing Deep Convolutional Neural Network (D-CNN) in identifying, classifying, and segmenting brain tumors as a result of the visible benefits of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (D-CNN) in Medical Image Analysis. When it comes to segmenting the timorous region included inside a brain, D-CNN is a set of techniques that has the potential to produce better outcomes when compared to techniques that do not involve deep learning. The multilayered, hierarchical, and block structure of D-CNN allows for the extraction of low-, mid-, and high-level information from pictures of brain tumors. D-CNN shows an outstanding performance in solving the segmentation and classification issues that are based on time and effort consuming tasks like fractionalization of brain tumor cells in Medical Image scans. This is in contrast to the large amount of time and effort that is required for the segmentation process by doctors and radiologists due to the high quantity of data produced by scan centers.","The paper directly didn't mentioned the difference between CNN and D-CNN. But it is referable from P1 and P2 that, D-CNN multilayered, hierarchical and block-structure compare to CNN.","Yes.

426,Which ensemle learning avg. probablity or weighted avg. probablity is used by the author in modelling?,"voting are some of the ensemble techniques that have been utilized in research in the literature most frequently. Each constituent base learner is given equal priority by the average probability-based ensemble. But for a specific issue, one basic classifier might be better equipped to gather data than another. Therefore, weighting all of the base classifiers is a better technique. However, the importance of the weights given to each classifier is the most important component in ensuring the ensemble's improved performance. The majority of methods base this number on the outcomes of experiments. In this study, we developed a novel weight allocation method in which the best weights for three base CNN models—SeresNet152, ResNet152v2, and DenseNet- 201, Vgg-19, and Resnext101—were determined using four evaluation metrics: precision, recall, f1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC). For providing weights to the base learners in research in the literature, only classification accuracy was often taken into account [8], which may not be a sufficient metric, especially when the datasets are class imbalanced. Other indicators might offer more useful data for deciding how important the basic learner is.",In P1 the author mentioned they developed a novel weight allocation method.

The following are the hyperparameters that were used: The dropout rate was 0.3, the learning rate was 0.0001, the batch size was 17, and there were 36 epochs. The model weights were updated using an adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer. Before the resizing, all of the photographs were shrunk to the default image size for each architecture.

431,Why does author use K-mode instead of K-means?,"The personality prediction is supported in this work by a questionnaire-based investigation. Openness to criticism, flexibility, team spirit, aspirations, and work ethics are among the traits that personality interview questions reveal. This aids to figure out how well a candidate may collaborate and work with team members. The responses to these queries give insight into the qualifications for the position The K- Modes clustering method is used in this survey-based investigation. The technique, which is simple to use and effective with vast amounts of data, is used to group categorical data. Based on the number of comparable categories between data points, clusters are defined. The k- modes clustering algorithm is an advancement over the k- means clustering method. K-means is the most widely used centre-based partitional clustering technique. Huang extends the k-means clustering method to the k-modes clustering algorithm to organize the categorical data: KModes clustering is one of the unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms that is used to cluster categorical variables. It is easy to implement and efficiently handles a large amount of data. A Kmodes technique uses a randomly selected starting cluster centre (modes) as a seed, which Categorical data cannot be clustered using the K-means clustering method due to the different metrics it uses. The K- mode cluster algorithms are based on the K-mean pattern but eliminate the restriction on numerical data while maintaining their efficacy. By removing the restriction imposed by Kmeans after modification, this K-mode technique extends the K-mean pattern to cluster categorical data: The distance cannot be calculated for categorical data points, though [46]. KModes algorithm is what we choose. It makes use of the differences between the data points (total mismatches). Our data points are more comparable overall, the smaller the differences. Rather than using means, it employs modes [36]. K-Modes clustering is more accurate than using K-means clustering as the K-mode algorithm uses categorical data to form clusters.","K-Modes clustering is more accurate than using K-means clustering as the K-mode algorithm uses categorical data to form clusters.

437,What are the various component of individual work performance?,"To assess how well current employees are working, individual work performance (IWP), a useful and regularly used outcome measure, is often utilized. Job performance may be correlated with personality. The phrase ""behaviours or acts that are related to the aims of the organization"" [7] is a definition of IWP. IWP thus emphasizes employee behaviours or activities rather than the outcomes of those behaviours. Additionally, behaviours should be in the individual's control, omitting those that are limited by the environment [8]. The personalities of the employees at any given time can be ascertained from their answers to a series of questions that can be given to them. The first dimension, task performance, traditionally has received the most attention and can be defined as ""the proficiency with which individuals perform the core substantive or technical tasks central to his or her job"" [7]. The second dimension of IWP is contextual performance, defined as “behaviours that support the organizational, social and psychological environment in which the technical core must function” [9]. The third dimension of IWP is counterproductive to work behaviour, defined as “behaviour that harms the well-being of the organization” [8].","Task performance, contextual performance and counter productive to work behaviour are the three components of individual work performance.","There is no one-size-fits-all definition for text-video paired datasets, as the length and content of both the text descriptions and the videos can vary greatly depending on the specific application and use case.

* Text length: Text descriptions can range from a few words to several sentences or even paragraphs, depending on the complexity of the scene and the desired level of detail.
* Text-video alignment: To ensure that the text and video are properly aligned, some datasets may use a temporal alignment method, such as frame-level alignment or sentence-level alignment.

440,"Can image content and style be ""fully"" or ""completely"" separated?","Again, we can visualise the information captured by these style feature spaces built on different layers of the network by constructing an image that matches the style representation of a given input image (Fig 1, style reconstructions). 10,11 Indeed reconstructions from the style features produce texturised versions of the input image that capture its general appearance in terms of colour and localised structures. Moreover, the size and complexity of local image structures from the input image increases along the hierarchy, a result that can be explained by the increasing receptive ﬁeld sizes and feature complexity. We refer to this multi-scale representation as style representation . The key ﬁnding of this paper is that the representations of content and style in the Convo- lutional Neural Network are separable. That is, we can manipulate both representations inde- pendently to produce new, perceptually meaningful images. To demonstrate this ﬁnding, we generate images that mix the content and style representation from two different source images. In particular, we match the content representation of a photograph depicting the “Neckarfront” in T ¨ ubingen, Germany and the style representations of several well-known artworks taken from different periods of art (Fig 2). The images are synthesised by ﬁnding an image that simultaneously matches the content representation of the photograph and the style representation of the respective piece of art (see Methods for details). While the global arrangement of the original photograph is preserved, the colours and local structures that compose the global scenery are provided by the artwork. Effectively, this renders the photograph in the style of the artwork, such that the appearance of the synthesised image resembles the work of art, even though it shows the same content as the photograph. As outlined above, the style representation is a multi-scale representation that includes mul- tiple layers of the neural network. In the images we have shown in Fig 2, the style representation including only a smaller number of lower layers, leading to different visual experiences (Fig 3, along the rows). When matching the style representations up to higher layers in the network, local images structures are matched on an increasingly large scale, leading to a smoother and more continuous visual experience. Thus, the visually most appealing images are usually cre- ated by matching the style representation up to the highest layers in the network (Fig 3, last row). Of course, image content and style cannot be completely disentangled. When synthesising an image that combines the content of one image with the style of another, there usually does not exist an image that perfectly matches both constraints at the same time. However, the loss function we minimise during image synthesis contains two terms for content and style respectively, that are well separated (see Methods). We can therefore smoothly regulate the emphasis on either reconstructing the content or the style (Fig 3, along the columns). A strong emphasis on style will result in images that match the appearance of the artwork, effectively giving a texturised version of it, but hardly show any of the photograph’s content (Fig 3, ﬁrst column). When placing strong emphasis on content, one can clearly identify the photograph, but the style of the painting is not as well-matched (Fig 3, last column). For a speciﬁc pair of source images one can adjust the trade-off between content and style to create visually appealing images. Here we present an artiﬁcial neural system that achieves a separation of image content from style, thus allowing to recast the content of one image in the style of any other image. We demonstrate this by creating new, artistic images that combine the style of several well-known paintings with the content of an arbitrarily chosen photograph. In particular, we derive the neural representations for the content and style of an image from the feature responses of high- performing Deep Neural Networks trained on object recognition. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst demonstration of image features separating content from style in whole natural images. Previous work on separating content from style was evaluated on sensory inputs of much lesser complexity, such as characters in different handwriting or images of faces or small ﬁgures in different poses. 12,13 In our demonstration, we render a given photograph in the style of a range of well-known artworks. This problem is usually approached in a branch of computer vision called non- photorealistic rendering (for recent review see 14 ). Conceptually most closely related are meth- ods using texture transfer to achieve artistic style transfer. 15–19 However, these previous ap- proaches mainly rely on non-parametric techniques to directly manipulate the pixel representa- tion of an image. In contrast, by using Deep Neural Networks trained on object recognition, we carry out manipulations in feature spaces that explicitly represent the high level content of an image. Features from Deep Neural Networks trained on object recognition have been previously used for style recognition in order to classify artworks according to the period in which they were created. 20 There, classiﬁers are trained on top of the raw network activations, which we call content representations. We conjecture that a transformation into a stationary feature space such as our style representation might achieve even better performance in style classiﬁcation. In general, our method of synthesising images that mix content and style from different sources, provides a new, fascinating tool to study the perception and neural representation of art, style and content-independent image appearance in general. We can design novel stimuli that introduce two independent, perceptually meaningful sources of variation: the appearance and the content of an image. We envision that this will be useful for a wide range of experimen- tal studies concerning visual perception ranging from psychophysics over functional imaging to even electrophysiological neural recordings. In fact, our work offers an algorithmic under- standing of how neural representations can independently capture the content of an image and the style in which it is presented. Importantly, the mathematical form of our style representa- 8 tions generates a clear, testable hypothesis about the representation of image appearance down to the single neuron level. The style representations simply compute the correlations between different types of neurons in the network. Extracting correlations between neurons is a bio- logically plausible computation that is, for example, implemented by so-called complex cells in the primary visual system (V1). 21 Our results suggest that performing a complex-cell like computation at different processing stages along the ventral stream would be a possible way to obtain a content-independent representation of the appearance of a visual input. All in all it is truly fascinating that a neural system, which is trained to perform one of the core computational tasks of biological vision, automatically learns image representations that allow the separation of image content from style. The explanation could be that when learning object recognition, the network has to become invariant to all image variation that preserves object identity. Representations that factorise the variation in the content of an image and the variation in its appearance would be extremely practical for this task. Thus, our ability to abstract content from style and therefore our ability to create and enjoy art might be primarily a preeminent signature of the powerful inference capabilities of our visual system.","The paper suggests that it is impossible to completely separate the content and the style of the image. But it is possible to extract their representations to then combine them with a loss function that allows the generation of visually appealing images that somewhat satisfy (not fully) the content and stylistic constraints. It is important to mention that the artistic style representation is just a correlation of filter responses between layers in CNN. The paper suggests that this is a plausible way to obtain the content-independent visual appearance of the image. When the object recognition model is learning, it has to be able to extract features that are invariant to different variations of images. Thus, it allows the separation of content and style representations. Previous methods use non-parametric techniques that directly manipulate the pixels of the image without such separation of representations.","No. While both channel shuffle and random sparse convolution involve rearranging the channel dimensions of a convolutional layer, they serve different purposes and have different effects on the network's performance.

441,Which loss function is used by authors during image synthesis? ,"creases with the position of the layer in the network. Hence a given input image (cid:126)x is encoded in each layer of the CNN by the ﬁlter responses to that image. A layer with N l distinct ﬁlters has N l feature maps each of size M l , where M l is the height times the width of the feature map. So the responses in a layer l can be stored in a matrix F l ∈ R N l × M l where F lij is the activation of the i th ﬁlter at position j in layer l . To visualise the image information that is encoded at different layers of the hierarchy (Fig 1, content reconstructions) we perform gradient descent on a white noise image to ﬁnd another image that matches the feature responses of the original image. So let (cid:126)p and (cid:126)x be the original image and the image that is generated and P l and F l their respective feature representation in layer l . We then deﬁne the squared-error loss between the two feature representations including only a smaller number of lower layers, leading to different visual experiences (Fig 3, along the rows). When matching the style representations up to higher layers in the network, local images structures are matched on an increasingly large scale, leading to a smoother and more continuous visual experience.

When matching the style representations up to higher layers in the network, local images structures are matched on an increasingly large scale, leading to a smoother and more continuous visual experience. Thus, the visually most appealing images are usually cre- ated by matching the style representation up to the highest layers in the network (Fig 3, last row). Of course, image content and style cannot be completely disentangled. When synthesising an image that combines the content of one image with the style of another, there usually does not exist an image that perfectly matches both constraints at the same time. However, the loss function we minimise during image synthesis contains two terms for content and style respectively, that are well separated (see Methods). We can therefore smoothly regulate the emphasis on either reconstructing the content or the style (Fig 3, along the columns). A strong emphasis on style will result in images that match the appearance of the artwork, effectively giving a texturised version of it, but hardly show any of the photograph’s content (Fig 3, ﬁrst column). When placing strong emphasis on content, one can clearly identify the photograph, but the style of the painting is not as well-matched (Fig 3, last column).

449,Would the reconstruction from higher layers be as good as reconstruction from the lower layers? Why or why not?,"The class of Deep Neural Networks that are most powerful in image processing tasks are called Convolutional Neural Networks. Convolutional Neural Networks consist of layers of small computational units that process visual information hierarchically in a feed-forward man- ner (Fig 1). Each layer of units can be understood as a collection of image ﬁlters, each of which extracts a certain feature from the input image. Thus, the output of a given layer consists of so-called feature maps: differently ﬁltered versions of the input image. When Convolutional Neural Networks are trained on object recognition, they develop a representation of the image that makes object information increasingly explicit along the pro- cessing hierarchy. 8 Therefore, along the processing hierarchy of the network, the input image is transformed into representations that increasingly care about the actual content of the im- age compared to its detailed pixel values. We can directly visualise the information each layer contains about the input image by reconstructing the image only from the feature maps in that layer 9 (Fig 1, content reconstructions, see Methods for details on how to reconstruct the im- age). Higher layers in the network capture the high-level content in terms of objects and their arrangement in the input image but do not constrain the exact pixel values of the reconstruc- tion. (Fig 1, content reconstructions d,e). In contrast, reconstructions from the lower layers simply reproduce the exact pixel values of the original image (Fig 1, content reconstructions a,b,c). We therefore refer to the feature responses in higher layers of the network as the content representation . To obtain a representation of the style of an input image, we use a feature space originally designed to capture texture information. 8 This feature space is built on top of the ﬁlter responses in each layer of the network. It consists of the correlations between the different ﬁlter responses the images shown in Fig 2 we matched the content representation on layer ‘conv4 2’ and the style representations on layers ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’, ‘conv4 1’ and ‘conv5 1’ ( w l = 1 / 5 in those layers, w l = 0 in all other layers) . The ratio α/β was either 1 × 10 − 3 (Fig 2 B,C,D) or 1 × 10 − 4 (Fig 2 E,F). Fig 3 shows results for different relative weightings of the content and style reconstruction loss (along the columns) and for matching the style representations only on layer ‘conv1 1’ (A), ‘conv1 1’ and ‘conv2 1’ (B), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’ and ‘conv3 1’ (C), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’ and ‘conv4 1’ (D), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’, ‘conv4 1’ and ‘conv5 1’ (E). The factor w l was always equal to one divided by the number of active layers with a non-zero loss-weight w l . including only a smaller number of lower layers, leading to different visual experiences (Fig 3, along the rows). When matching the style representations up to higher layers in the network, local images structures are matched on an increasingly large scale, leading to a smoother and more continuous visual experience. Thus, the visually most appealing images are usually cre- ated by matching the style representation up to the highest layers in the network (Fig 3, last row).

Also, it is possible to change the emphasis between the content representation and style representation using the loss function. In general, the results of combining lower-layer content representations with styles are not presented, thus it is difficult to answer the question just from the paper's contents.","Sure!

450,How did the authors ensure to keep the factor wl equal to one divided by the number of active layers with a non-zero loss-weight wl?,"On top of the CNN responses in each layer of the network we built a style representation that computes the correlations between the different filter responses, where the expectation is taken over the spatial extend of the input image. These feature correlations are given by the Gram matrix Gl ∈ RNl×Nl , where Gl ij is the inner product between the vectorised feature map and j in layer l: Gl ij = ∑ k F l ikF l jk. (3) To generate a texture that matches the style of a given image (Fig 1, style reconstructions), we use gradient descent from a white noise image to find another image that matches the style representation of the original image. This is done by minimising the mean-squared distance between the entries of the Gram matrix from the original image and the Gram matrix of the image to be generated. So let ~a and ~x be the original image and the image that is generated and Al and Gl their respective style representations in layer l. The contribution of that layer to the total loss is then El = 1 4N 2 l M 2 l ∑ i,j (Gl ij − Al ij )2 (4) and the total loss is Lstyle(~a, ~x) = L∑ l=0 wlEl (5) where wl are weighting factors of the contribution of each layer to the total loss (see below for specific values of wl in our results). The derivative of El with respect to the activations in layer l can be computed analytically: ∂El ∂F l ij = { 1 N 2 l M 2 l ((F l)T (Gl − Al)) ji if F l ij > 0 0 if F l ij < 0 . (6) The gradients of El with respect to the activations in lower layers of the network can be readily computed using standard error back-propagation. The five style reconstructions in Fig 1 were generated by matching the style representations on layer ‘conv1 1’ (a), ‘conv1 1’ and ‘conv2 1’ (b), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’ and ‘conv3 1’ (c), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’ and ‘conv4 1’ (d), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’, ‘conv4 1’ and ‘conv5 1’ (e). To generate the images that mix the content of a photograph with the style of a painting (Fig 2) we jointly minimise the distance of a white noise image from the content representation of the photograph in one layer of the network and the style representation of the painting in a number of layers of the CNN. So let ~p be the photograph and ~a be the artwork. The loss function we minimise is Ltotal(~p, ~a, ~x) = αLcontent(~p, ~x) + βLstyle(~a, ~x) (7) where α and β are the weighting factors for content and style reconstruction respectively. For the images shown in Fig 2 we matched the content representation on layer ‘conv4 2’ and the style representations on layers ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’, ‘conv4 1’ and ‘conv5 1’ (wl = 1/5 in those layers, wl = 0 in all other layers) . The ratio α/β was either 1×10−3 (Fig 2 B,C,D) or 1 × 10−4 (Fig 2 E,F). Fig 3 shows results for different relative weightings of the content and style reconstruction loss (along the columns) and for matching the style representations only on layer ‘conv1 1’ (A), ‘conv1 1’ and ‘conv2 1’ (B), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’ and ‘conv3 1’ (C), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’ and ‘conv4 1’ (D), ‘conv1 1’, ‘conv2 1’, ‘conv3 1’, ‘conv4 1’ and ‘conv5 1’ (E).

Leveraging a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM) [2], each attention head samples a bipartite graph connecting queries to keys. Then, the adjacency of the sampled graph is used as an attention mask so that only attention scores corresponding to sampled edges are computed.The overall computational cost is linear in the number of edges, which can range from linear to quadratic in sequence length depending on the data and task under concern. Each attention head is equipped with its own underlying SBM, enabling the model to diversify the attention sparsity across heads and layers. By incorporating a straight-through estimator [4] in the discrete graph-sampling step, SBM-Transformer enjoys end-to-end differentiability and can find the proper attention sparsity based solely upon minimizing the predictive loss. The model can also easily be further regularized by penalizing the number of sampled edges, which results in a lighter model using less computational resources during inference. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first Transformer architecture that can data-adaptively choose between linear to full attention with respective computational costs. To summarize, our main contributions are as follows:",SBM-Transformer is the first Transformer architecture that can data-adaptively choose between linear to full attention with respective computational costs.,"NO.

452,What is a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model?,"The Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is a generative model that encodes the latent structure of graphs by grouping nodes into clusters. By modeling the cluster-membership of each node as well as inter-cluster relationships, SBMs can represent a wide variety of graph structures, which is a feature especially useful for generating new graphs or predicting missing edges in noisy data [1]. The standard SBM assigns each node to a single cluster, and the probability of an edge between two nodes strictly depends on the corresponding clusters. Several structural extensions include overlapping SBM [24] and mixed-membership SBM [2], which allow each node to be assigned to multiple clusters. The underlying SBM used by our framework mostly resembles these two variants, while the edge probability is modeled by a nonlinear function of two node embeddings rather than a bilinear one. There exist many other extensions including degree-corrected SBM [20] for multi-graphs and hierarchical SBM [31] for multiplex-graphs. Further details can be found in a recent survey [16].",The mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is a generative model that encodes the latent structure of graphs by assigning each node into multiple clusters.,"No, we can extend it to more frames.

Our SBM-Transformer achieves the best overall performance, ranking first in two tasks, and second in one other. SBM-Transformer also outperforms full attention in all five tasks while computing 30% or less attention scores on average, which supports our claim that masked attention with partial attention score computations can be preferred over full attention depending on the task. With respect to the attention mask structure, we find that flexibility of SBM is indeed beneficial, as Reformer struggles in ListOps, most likely due to the inability of block-diagonal masks to model hierarchical contexts.

455,"What is ""local attention""?","One way to remove the quadratic bottleneck from the attention score matrix is to apply a binary mask \bm{M}\in\{0,1\}^{n\times n} and compute the scaled dot-products \bm{Q}_{i}\bm{K}_{j}^{T}/\sqrt{d_{h}} only if \bm{M}_{ij}=1. In presence of an attention mask, the operation is modified to\displaystyle\texttt{Attn}_{\text{mask}}(\bm{X},\bm{M})=\sigma_{\bm{M}}\left(\bm{M}\odot\dfrac{\bm{Q}\bm{K}^{T}}{\sqrt{d_{h}}}\right)\bm{V}(3)\displaystyle\sigma_{\bm{M}}(\bm{A})_{ij}\coloneqq\begin{cases}\dfrac{\exp(\bm{A}_{ij})}{\sum_{k\in\{k^{\prime}|\bm{M}_{ik^{\prime}}=1\}}\exp(\bm{A}_{ik})}&\text{if}\;\;\bm{M}_{ij}=1\\\hfil 0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}(4)where \odot indicates entry-wise multiplication. Note that the masked-softmax \sigma_{\bm{M}}(\cdot) operator only computes unmasked terms, ensuring that each (i,j)-th attention score survives as nonzero if and only if \bm{M}_{ij}=1. This is thus equivalent to filling in the (i,j)-th attention score with -\infty if \bm{M}_{ij}=0, then applying the standard softmax operator. Most sparsity-based efficient Transformers fall under this formulation, while using different methods to either manually fix or learn the mask \bm{M}. For instance, local attention [9, 3, 51] with a sliding window sets \bm{M}_{ij}=1 if |i-j|<c for some context window size c while Reformer [22] sets \bm{M}_{ij}=1 if \bm{Q}_{i} and \bm{K}_{j} are hashed into the same bucket.",Local attention is a Transformer model that uses a sliding window of some fixed context window size.,"Sure!

456,"How is the ""average attention sparsity"" measured in the experiments?","To test if the model can effectively learn under a constraint on the computational cost, we also test the model under a sparsity-based regularizer that discourages excessive use of query-key edges. We penalize each sampled edge by adding to the predictive loss a weighted regularization term \lambda\mathcal{L}_{s}, where \mathcal{L}_{s} denotes the average mask density across all attention heads. Table 9 shows the performance of SBM-Transformer across varying regularization weights. Under strong regularization, the model surprisingly retains competitive performance while significantly reducing the average mask density.This indicates that similar local optima are shared across regimes with varying attention density in the loss landscape, and the regularization term is able to drive the model towards finding optimal attention scores with smaller density. We also compare the densities of masks sampled at each layer of SBM-Transformer during test time to examine whether our model is capable of diversifying sparsity across layers for better performance. Recall that this allows models to gather information in different levels, as seen in pretrained BERT where lower layers focus on the overall content via dense attention while upper layers gather syntactic information with tree-like patterns [11]. For each of the five tasks, we pick two highest-performing models (one for unregularized and another for regularized) for measurement. Figure 5 shows the average layer-wise mask densities of unregularized and regularized SBM-Transformers across different tasks. We find that under no regularization, the two layers can differ by more than 10% in tasks such as ListOps and Image. This may be due to the hierarchical and compositional structure of the two tasks. We also find that the variation is relatively low in Text with densities around 25%, indicating that the task requires broad attention overall. Lastly, the standard deviation is extremely large in upper layers for Pathfinder, showing that it samples a wide variety of masks depending on the input.",The average attention sparsity is measured by the densities of masks sampled in SBM-Transformer averaged across all attention heads.,"Maximizing log-likelihood leads to optimizing cross-entropy between the target probability distribution and the model prediction because the log-likelihood is a measure of how well the model's predictions match the target distribution. The cross-entropy loss function is a common measure of the difference between two probability distributions, and maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the cross-entropy loss.

459,The forward step of SBM-Transformer requires additional parameters and computation compared to the original Transformer architecture due to SBM sampling. Is this additional cost outweighed by exploiting sparsity?,"Furthermore, we compare computational costs during inference by measuring FLOP count and peak memory usage. For SBM-Transformer, we test the model trained under \lambda=10^{-1}. Due to lack of support for sparse tensor operations in existing FLOP-counters, we measure FLOP counts by manually enumerating through each tensor operation. Table 3 shows that SBM-Transformer is comparably efficient across all tasks except for Text, where SBM-Transformer showed the largest average mask density. Note that while the cost of other baselines are fixed after initialization, the cost of SBM-Transformer is data-adaptive and can vary input-by-input. Further analysis and qualitative examples demonstrating the input-dependent attention mask densities can be found in Appendix C. Nonetheless, there are limitations due to sparse tensor operations being less optimized on GPU kernels. In the LRA experiments, we found that SBM-Transformer can result in longer runtimes compared to dense counterparts while its memory usage is much lower. While previous sparsity-based attention mechanisms with block-sparse attention are much more amenable for GPU computation [51, 9, 3], our work requires an architecture with better workload balancing and acceleration under unstructured sparsity, for which there is ongoing work [46, 54].","SBM-Transformer is efficient compared to existing baselines in terms of FLOP count and peak memory use, but can result in longer runtimes due to sparse tensor operations being less optimized on GPU kernels.","The authors accommodate video datasets by using a 3D U-Net diffusion model architecture, which is factorized over space and time, and by training the model jointly on video and image generative modeling objectives",0.1016949102671648,0.0,0.1016949102671648,1.493369524819332,21.695171646334,17.700272150340464,0.0714285714285714,0.0099009900990099,0.1164507865905761,0.4329348935773877,0.1164507269859314,0.4488537311553955,0.0026653226670079,0.0,0.7520679074438656,0.7545863412724467

These zero eigenvalues arise naturally and play a role in disregarding group information; those are ineffective towards prediction. However, zero elements in the eigen values causes a major problem in the decomposition process since the matrix might carry a singular determinant.Eigen decomposition is based on an iterative approximation algorithm which includes unbounded terms if any two eigen values are small or close.

463,How does NGMPool work exactly? How is it different from GMPool?,"To overcome this challenge, we propose GMPool, a general pooling framework that does not require an universal number of clusters as a user hyperparameter. Figure 1 depicts the overall framework of GMPool. The core intuition is that the product of a pooling matrix with itself forms a grouping matrix, where each (i,j)-th entry indicates the pairwise clustering similarity: whether the nodes i and j are pooled to the same clusters. For each graph, GMPool parameterizes the clustering similarities in its grouping matrix via a classification layer. Finally, we perform SVD on the grouping matrix to obtain the pooling matrix such that the overall rank represents the suitable number of clusters. We also test a single-pooling variant NGMPool that does not perform any decomposition, but rather uses the grouping matrix as is.

466,What makes GMPool and NGMPool novel compared to existing graph pooling methods?,"In this section, we propose a novel differentiable pooling layer, GMPool, which obtains the pooling matrix by first building a grouping matrix that contains clustering similarities of pairwise nodes and then decomposing the matrix into its square-root form. We start the section with preliminary information, then outline the details of GMPool in later sections. To overcome this challenge, we propose GMPool, a general pooling framework that does not require an universal number of clusters as a user hyperparameter. Figure 1 depicts the overall framework of GMPool. The core intuition is that the product of a pooling matrix with itself forms a grouping matrix, where each (i,j)-th entry indicates the pairwise clustering similarity: whether the nodes i and j are pooled to the same clusters. For each graph, GMPool parameterizes the clustering similarities in its grouping matrix via a classification layer. Finally, we perform SVD on the grouping matrix to obtain the pooling matrix such that the overall rank represents the suitable number of clusters. We also test a single-pooling variant NGMPool that does not perform any decomposition, but rather uses the grouping matrix as is. In real-world molecular property prediction tasks, we show that our approach outperforms previous baselines, while successfully learning suitable clusters. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:•We design a grouping matrix-based pooling operator that does not require users to specify the number of clusters a priori.•We propose GMPool and NGMPool. GMPool performs SVD on the grouping matrix to obtain the pooling matrix, whereas NGMPool utilizes the grouping matrix as is.•We demonstrate the power of our methods both quantitatively and qualitatively on a wide range of real molecular property prediction tasks.

467,Why did the authors choose to test the proposed graph pooling method specifically on molecular property prediction tasks?,"In most inductive settings, there is no single number of clusters that is suitable across all graphs in the dataset.Particularly in molecular graphs, the number of functional groups often determines useful characteristics and chemical behaviors, while varying significantly across different molecules.Nonetheless, existing pooling methods require the number of clusters as a hyperparameter, then operates under the assumption that all graphs share the same number of clusters ranjan2020asap . This is often undesirable as it not only requires additional hyperparameter tuning, but also imposes a strong inductive bias that deteriorates downstream performance.

468,How do the authors deal with the numerical instability that may occur due to incorporating SVD into the proposed method?,"After acquiring the pooling operator, the pooling process becomes obvious. Nodes are in fundamental representation while edge features and adjacency matrix are in adjoint representation. Which leads to the following transformation rules.\displaystyle X_{i}^{(l+1)}=S^{(l)}X_{i}^{(l)}(13)\displaystyle E_{ij}^{(l+1)}=S^{(l)}E_{ij}^{(l)}S^{(l)T}(14)\displaystyle A_{ij}^{(l+1)}=S^{(l)}A_{ij}^{(l)}S^{(l)T}(15)If grouping is properly done, 0 (or close to 0) components will appear in the decomposed eigen value matrix. These zero eigenvalues arise naturally and play a role in disregarding group information; those are ineffective towards prediction. However, zero elements in the eigen values causes a major problem in the decomposition process since the matrix might carry a singular determinant.Eigen decomposition is based on an iterative approximation algorithm which includes unbounded terms if any two eigen values are small or close. One can see clearly about this matter in DBLP:journals/corr/IonescuVS15 .\Big{(}\frac{\partial{l}}{\partial{A}}\Big{)}=U\big{(}K^{T}\odot(U^{T}\frac{\partial{l}}{\partial{U}})+(\frac{\partial{l}}{\partial{\Lambda}})_{\textrm{diag}})(U^{T})(16)Here, \odot denotes element-wise product. Off-diagonal components of K=1/(\lambda_{i}-\lambda_{j}) causes the problem, since the value blows up to the infinity if any two eigen values are close or very small. However, there are some solutions for this matter by approximating gradient in different ways DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1906-09023 ; 9400752 ; DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2105-02498 . Those methods are developed further to achieve higher speed in the calculation DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2201-08663 . They claim that the method is noticeably faster, over 8 times, than the standard SVD which has the time complexity \mathcal{O}(n^{3}). Thus, we utilized this method in our work to stabilize and accelerate the learning process. However, since the algorithm achieves the higher speed by approximating gradients, the error compared to standard SVD grows bigger as the size of the matrix grows. Therefore, this method might not be valid with large sized graph data. While our model is useful and effective, there is still room for improvement. First of all, despite leveraging a method to decompose the grouping matrix with stable gradient computations, there exist corner cases with a small eigengap at which the model fails to converge. This event seldom happens (about 0.00018\% in our experiments), but can be non-negligible when one needs to learn with a large number of data points. Hence, one future direction would be to impose proper constraints on the loss to avoid such gradient blowup in the grouping matrix.",GMPool decomposes the grouping matrix using a method that approximates gradients in SVD to stabilize gradient computations.,The metrics used to compare the efficiency of different methods for computing adversarial perturbations are the running time required for each method to compute one adversarial sample,0.1499999951125001,0.0,0.1499999951125001,1.7143713968707794,20.655114961516485,16.979493212069052,0.1322751322751323,0.0106846062524732,0.2410648912191391,0.475772300291629,0.2410647273063659,0.520756185054779,0.0129458858811517,,0.7786017580049224,0.7452313485535641

However, this is likely to incur loss in predictive performance, and as the focus of this work lies in allowing variation in the number of clusters in small molecular graphs where scalability is not an issue, we defer improving the scalability to future work.","One future direction to enhance scalability of GMPool is to incorporate faster decomposition modules such as randomized approximation methods.

470,The paper mentions GMPool can be used with any GNN architecture besides DMPNN.

Note that while we chose DMPNN due to its superior performance over GNN architectures, our pooling layer is module-agnostic and can be combined with any GNN as long as node representations are returned as output.Given a graph, DMPNN first initializes the hidden state of each edge (i,j) based on its feature E_{ij} and the source-node’s feature X_{i}. At each timestep t, each directional edge gathers hidden states from incident edges into a message m_{ij}^{t+1} and updates its own hidden state to h_{ij}^{t+1} as follows\displaystyle m_{ij}^{t+1}=\sum_{k\in\mathcal{N}(i)\setminus j}h_{ki}^{t}(1)\displaystyle h_{ij}^{t+1}=\texttt{ReLU}(h_{ij}^{0}+W_{e}m_{ij}^{t+1})(2)Here, \mathcal{N}(i) denotes the set of neighboring nodes of node i and W_{e} a learnable weight.

Assuming DMPNN runs for T timesteps, we use (X_{out},E_{out})=\texttt{GNN}(A,X,E) to denote the output representation matrices containing hidden states of all nodes and edges, respectively (i.e., X_{out,i}=h_{i}^{T} and E_{out,ij}=h_{ij}^{T}).","While the authors chose DMPNN due to its superior performance over GNN architectures, the proposed pooling layer is module-agnostic and can be combined with any GNN.

472,Only a small number of examples (32) are randomly selected to be unlearned. Have the authors tried unlearning much larger portions of the training data and observing the effect on the resulting model?,"We show the effect of varying s (the # of data instances to be forgotten at once) in Figure 2a across model scales. We denote this approach as batch unlearning. As shown by the s=128 results, it is harder to forget more samples at once, resulting in substantial degradation of average LM performance regardless of how large the LM is. Since s\leq 32 does not show much degradation, we explore if sequentially unlearning can be a solution. In Figure 2b, we show the result of dividing the 128 samples into 4 chunks of 32 and performing sequential unlearning; we unlearn each chunk at a time until the chunk reaches the forgetting threshold. Surprisingly, as shown by the performance gap at s=128 between the dotted lines (the s=128 performance of Figure 2a) and straight lines, the end result is vastly different even though exactly the same instances were forgotten. Sequential unlearning shows almost no degradation of average LM performance. In Appendix G, we show that chunks once forgotten stay forgotten and that later chunks are forgotten much faster compared to the initial chunk. This result hints at the generalization of unlearning, which we do not further explore in the scope of this work.

480,How is the proposed work different from the previous works using Transformer-based VAE frameworks in terms of representation learning? ,"We concretely use the variational Transformer inspired by Lin et al. [22]. They used a Transformer-based model extended by a conditional VAE framework to gener- ate a response from a conditional context . We leverage this seq2seq architecture to achieve a variational neural machine translation (VNMT) from a given melody to the chords [23]–[25]. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to apply the VNMT approach to music generation. In particular, our approach is different from previous music generation studies using the variational Transformer, which mostly served as an autoencoder [26], [27]. Furthermore, we attempt to regularize the variational Transformer for controlling the chord outputs through a dis- entangled representation. Generating arbitrary sets of chords may not satisfy users who would like to create music based on their own tastes. In terms of building interactive music gen- eration systems as well as learning a good representation for sequential data, controllable generation with the VAE frame- work has mainly been approached by recent studies. These studies have aimed to learn disentangled representations for high-level musical features, such as pitch, rhythm, harmony, context, or arousal, through supervised learning [28]–[31]. Inspired by these studies, we use domain-speciﬁc induc- tive bias to achieve a disentangled representation for the well-summarized context of the target melody and chords. Furthermore, Choi et al.

482,What is the benefit of using note-based representation over grid-based representations?,"where e T , e N , S , and N denote the time-level embed- ding vectors, note-level embedding vectors, STHarm, and the number of melody notes, respectively, Embedding and Self-AttBlocks denote the embedding layer and L multi- head self-attention blocks that are identical to the vanilla Transformer, respectively [12], w ∗ denotes a sinusoidal posi- tional embedding scaled by a trainable weight [40], and TimeToNote is a novel method that we propose to convert the timewise embedding to the notewise embedding to capture the note patterns in a melody. Nevertheless, these LSTM-based studies had limitations in generating concrete chord structures. First, the models were unable to encode an original melodic structure despite their sequential architectures [4]. The notes in a melody were aggregated within a chord duration into a pitch-class histogram before being fed to the model. Second, the models did not explicitly consider capturing the patterns of chord pro- gressions. Chord labels correspond to the constant time grids (e.g., a bar or half-bar). Sequential modeling of grid-based chord labels is likely to result in ambiguous patterns or hier- archies of the generated outputs [8].","Note-based representation is better than grid-based representation in learning chord patterns. The reason is that learning with the grid-based representation can result in generating chord progression with ambiguous patterns or hierarchies.

483,The authors claim that LSTM-based approaches have failed to capture realistic pattern of chords. Is it true?,"Nevertheless, these LSTM-based studies had limitations in generating concrete chord structures. First, the models were unable to encode an original melodic structure despite their sequential architectures [4]. The notes in a melody were aggregated within a chord duration into a pitch-class histogram before being fed to the model. Second, the models did not explicitly consider capturing the patterns of chord pro- gressions. Chord labels correspond to the constant time grids (e.g., a bar or half-bar). Sequential modeling of grid-based chord labels is likely to result in ambiguous patterns or hier- archies of the generated outputs [8]. Figs. 4 and 5 show some of the actual samples from the listening test for all ﬁve models as well as the human- composed music. These samples reveal the strengths of the proposed models. First, Fig. 4 mainly shows that the proposed models tend to reproduce the binary metrical structure of the chords compared to the baseline models. The binary metric structure is close to real-world music, most of which has been composed of four beats and strongly inﬂuenced by metrical boundaries [52]. In contrast, the chords generated from the baseline models show some syncopated rhythms, which can weaken the metrical boundaries. Fig. 5 illustrates another advantage of the proposed models, which is that the majority of the chord roots tend to shift in intervals either of perfect fourth or ﬁfth according to the circle-of- ﬁfths rule. This aspect reﬂects conventional Western music theory, which serves as domain knowledge for modeling real-world music [51], [54]. Moreover, the proposed models are shown to generate some natural chromatic progressions according to the given melody. On the other hand, the baseline models show some short transitions on the circle-of-ﬁfths at arbitrary spots, in contrast to the melody with regular phrasings.","LSTM-based approaches have failed to capture realistic patterns of chords due to two reasons. The first reason is that they cannot encode an original melodic structure by aggregating melody notes for each chord into a pitch-class histogram before being fed to the model. The second reason is that they capture ambiguous patterns or hierarchies in chord progressions since they recurrently model grid-based chord labels. Empirically, it has been investigated that the LSTM-based models tend to generate some syncopated chord rhythms that can weaken the metrical boundaries, unlike real-world music.","The images were not selected randomly, but were picked by the authors",0.074999997628125,0.0,0.074999997628125,0.5347975950976668,12.418417845961384,11.025986864582793,0.0342075256556442,0.0013934045517882,0.0435102209448814,0.4603822156485275,0.2019098997116089,0.3031112849712372,0.0120920461437414,0.5,0.735148716842876,0.7303523457001322
484,"Is TimeToNote method truly a novel idea to capture a musical hierarchy? It seems to be just a simple trick that also have been used in one of the previous music generation studies (MuseMorphose, 2021).","In the Time2Note procedure, we add the scaled positional embedding w T to e (S) T . Then, we transfer it to the notewise embedding e (S) N with average pooling by an alignment matrix M ∈ { 0 , 1 } T × N as (2), where M indicates the alignment path between a piano roll and a series of notes. This process enables each frame of the notewise embedding to preserve the information of the original note duration : However, conventional Transformer-based studies encoded music as a series of musical events [15]. Using event-based representations differs from how humans perceive a rendered or score-written melody for harmonization [16]. Instead, a grid-based melody representation can be more intuitive for modeling melodic patterns synchronized with chord labels [4], [17], [18]. In our work, we convert a melody into a more intuitive note-based representation, where each frame represents one note. To this end, we use a novel time-to-note compression method to map a binary piano roll representation into a note-based embedding.","TimeToNote method is different from similar approaches to capture musical hierarchy. First, it aims to aggregate grid-based information into musically meaningful units, while previous approaches map low-level musical units to high-level musical units, such as a bar. Moreover, the aggregated information preserves the length information of the original representation, which is also different from the previous studies that simply average-pooled the representation.","Hard attention models select one patch of the image to attend to at a time, while soft attention models place weights ""softly"" over all patches in the source image",0.1428571383510205,0.0229885014665089,0.114285709779592,1.7363000884761202,23.664514535042784,21.04018839903033,0.0679758308157099,0.0050619654389945,0.0919416844844818,0.4926057512084285,0.1643931716680526,0.241791695356369,0.0037712276627232,0.0,0.7415808995329071,0.758951374378076
485,"What does ""global key signature"" mean?","The proposed architecture of VTHarm is inspired by [22]. VTHarm has an additional probabilistic encoder for a latent variable z , where z represents the global attribute of the aggregated melody and chords. We denote this encoder as the context encoder . We add a global key signature label as a conditional input token to the model. The key signature is essential for an arbitrary melody to obtain a certain harmonic context [41]. The key signature token can aid the model in specifying the latent space and sampling the outputs from the human-composed samples from CMD and HLSD include 72 different chord types with various amounts of musical tensions. 2) STHarm may generate common chords more fre- quently from the average chord distribution than the human- composed music, as shown in the lower diversity scores. Concretely, the most frequent chords in real-world music are diatonic chords such as the C, G, and F major chords in the C major key [9]. Since these chords have relatively less musical tension with respect to a melody, they are close to the melody under a music-theoretical space. Thus, these chords may obtain better coherence scores than other chords with more musical tension. Moreover, Human shows lower diversity scores than the variational models. We assume that this is because these mod- els can produce some infrequent chords far from the mean distribution of real-world music. The nature of stochastic generation models draws samples from the normal distribu- tion [49]. Some of the generated chords may violate the given key signature but increase the information outside the certain harmonic context. Hence, they may contribute to higher chord diversity than human-composed music. We conduct an ablation study to verify the beneﬁt of adding the conditional token c to VTHarm and rVTHarm. We assume that c provides key signature information that can efﬁciently constrain the latent space to a concrete harmonic context, improving the chord structuredness and reconstruction per- formance of the model. We compute the chord similarity metrics between the ground truth and generated chords from the VT models according to the presence of c . The results are demonstrated in Table 7. This table shows that the VT models without c mostly obtain worse scores for all similarity metrics than the models with c . This indicates that adding key signature information to the VT models in most cases not only enhances the one-by-one accuracy but also improves the structure of the generated chords to be more human-like.","""Global key signature"" means the harmonic context of music that is constrained to a certain range. For example, the C major key is constrained to have functionally important chords such as C, G, and F major chords.","Sure! Here's my answer:

486,"How ""chord coverage"" can represent chord complexity, which cannot be simply defined without considering the human perception of music?","We expand the conventional criteria [10], [11] for deeper analysis of human judgment.

491,What is the difference between TPSD anc DICD?,"distance (DICD) measure the distance between two chord progressions: • Tonal pitch step distance (TPSD). TPSD computes the geometrical dissimilarity between the generated chords and the ground-truth chords in terms of the tonal pitch space (TPS) chord distance rule [53]. The TPS between chord x and chord y is computed as (16): where j is the least number of steps in one direction from the chordal root of x to that of y according to the circle-of-ﬁfths rule. In the circle-of-ﬁfths rule, all pitch classes are arranged in intervals of either perfect ﬁfth or fourth [54]. The variable k is the number of unique pitch class indices in the four levels (root, ﬁfths, triadic, diatonic) within the basic space of y compared to x [53]. That is, if the pitch class index is shared by y and x , it is not counted. We compute the TPS values between all pairs of adjacent chords within each progression, DICD computes the city block distance between the directed interval class (DIC) representation vectors for the chord transitions [55]. DIC is the histogram vector of the directional pitch interval classes, ranging from −5 to 6, computed between all pairs of chord notes from the two adjacent chords.

492,"Generating average chords and low diversity score are not analogous. Is it true that STHarm generates ""common"" chords that are frequent in real-world music?","Table 5 shows that the results mainly support the quantita- tive evaluation results. In contrast, STHarm shows the highest H score regardless of melody awareness. This suggests that STHarm outputs plausible chords to listen to than the baseline models. For U and C, VTHarm shows the highest scores, and the variational models show lower harmonicity and prefer- ence scores than STHarm. We assume that the variational models tend to generate more chords far from the mean distribution of the learned music data than STHarm. Such unique chords can reveal more inharmonicity than the fre- quent chords, and it may have provided the participants with unpleasant feelings. In addition, most participants listened to popular music, where common chords with less musical tension are used. Therefore, it may have led the participants providing poorer scores on preference as well as harmonicity. Nevertheless, VTHarm shows a better P score than ONADE with lower U and C scores. This means that VTHarm is more persuasive than the baseline model with lower chord complexity.","STHarm may have generated ""common"" chords that are frequent in real-world music.

Generating arbitrary sets of chords may not satisfy users who would like to create music based on their own tastes. In terms of building interactive music gen- eration systems as well as learning a good representation for sequential data, controllable generation with the VAE frame- work has mainly been approached by recent studies. These studies have aimed to learn disentangled representations for high-level musical features, such as pitch, rhythm, harmony, context, or arousal, through supervised learning [28]–[31]. Inspired by these studies, we use domain-speciﬁc induc- tive bias to achieve a disentangled representation for the well-summarized context of the target melody and chords. Furthermore, we compute Pearson’s correlation coefﬁ- cients between α and the CC scores of the corresponding chord outputs.

498,Is it valid to conclude that the baseline models are weaker than the proposed models since they generate some syncopated rhythms of chords?,"Figs. 4 and 5 show some of the actual samples from the listening test for all ﬁve models as well as the human- composed music. These samples reveal the strengths of the proposed models. First, Fig. 4 mainly shows that the proposed models tend to reproduce the binary metrical structure of the chords compared to the baseline models. The binary metric structure is close to real-world music, most of which has been composed of four beats and strongly inﬂuenced by metrical boundaries [52]. In contrast, the chords generated from the baseline models show some syncopated rhythms, which can weaken the metrical boundaries. Fig. 5 illustrates another advantage of the proposed models, which is that the majority of the chord roots tend to shift in intervals either of perfect fourth or ﬁfth according to the circle-of- ﬁfths rule. This aspect reﬂects conventional Western music theory, which serves as domain knowledge for modeling real-world music [51], [54]. Moreover, the proposed models are shown to generate some natural chromatic progressions according to the given melody.

The context encoder maps the chord input y 1 : O into the embedding e (V) O . Then, c is concatenated at the beginning of e (V) O over the sequence dimension before the multihead self-attention blocks. The self-attention output contains the harmonic context according to the key informa- tion. It is mean-aggregated over time so that it represents the global information of the chords [26]. The encoder output E ( c , x 1 : T ) is also mean aggregated over time to represent the global attribute of a melody. These two aggregated vectors are concatenated over the feature dimension and pass through the bottleneck, resulting in two parameters, µ , and σ . The latent code z is inferred from µ and σ through the reparam- eterization trick, and its prior is assumed to be the normal distribution [19]. The right-shifted chord input is ﬁrst encoded with the same lookup table from the context encoder. The latent variable z and the key signature token c are added to the beginning, which corresponds to the ‘‘start-of-sequence’’ part of the chord embedding.

The features for a musical score represent eight categorical attributes for how the notes are composed:Pitch is a MIDI index number that ranges from 21 to 108.RelDuration and RelIOI are 11-class attributes of a quantized duration and IOI between a note onset and a previous chord, respectively. They range from 1 to 11, and each class represents a multiple of a 16th note’s length with respect to a given tempo [30, 31].IsTopVoice is a binary attribute of whether the note is the uppermost voice. It is heuristically computed regarding pitches and durations of surrounding notes.PositionInChord and NumInChord are 11-class attributes of a positional index of a note within its chord and the total number of notes in that chord, respectively, that range from 1 to 11. An index 1 for PositionInChord denotes the most bottom position.Staff is a binary attribute of the staff of a note, either of the G clef or F clef.IsDownbeat is a binary attribute of whether a note is at a downbeat or not.",IsTopVoice is different from PositionInChord in that an index 1 of IsTopVoice represents the uppermost voice while that of PositionInChord represents the lowermost voice.

504,"Why didn't the authors intend a ""chord"" to represent a more meaningful unit in music, such as a beat?","We employ a self-supervised learning framework to force the latent representations to learn our target attributes [25, 26, 24].In addition, we facilitate independent control of the three expressive attributes–dynamics, articulation, and tempo–by utilizing an existing method that aligns the latent code with a target attribute [27, 28]. Finally, we design a novel mechanism that intuitively models a polyphonic structure of piano performance. In particular, we insert intermediate steps for chordwise encoding and decoding of the piano performance to our encoder-decoder architecture, where a chord denotes a group of simultaneous notes. Our approach has several contributions as follows:1) Our system aims to control musical expression while maintaining any characteristics induced by a given musical structure;2) We use self-supervised learning where new supervisory signals are involved in regularizing the latent representations effectively;3) Our system aims to control multiple expressive attributes independently of each other;4) Lastly, we leverage an intermediate step that projects a notewise representation into the chordwise in the middle of our system to intuitively model the polyphonic structure of piano performance. Inspired by previous studies [4, 8, 9, 32], we build a twostep encoder and decoder: An encoder models both notewise and chordwise dependencies of the inputs, and a decoder reconstructs the notewise dependency from the chordwise representation and the notewise condition. We denote a chord as a group of notes that are hit simultaneously, regardless of the staff, so that they sound together at an instant time [33]. Thus, learning the chordwise dependency is analogous to direct modeling of the temporal progression of the piano performance. Let M 2 RC N be a matrix that aligns serialized notes to their polyphonic structure, where C and N are the number of chords and the number of notes, respectively. Within the encoder, the","The authors intend a ""chord"" to represent simultaneous notes to intuitively models a polyphonic structure of piano performance that is defined by its temporal progression.

505,Is there no temporal dependency between the latent variable for explicit planning?,"Inference. A probabilistic encoder parameterized by \phi approximates the posterior distibutions of the latent representations z^{(\text{pln})} and z^{(\text{str})} from the performance input x and conditional score input y:\displaystyle q_{\phi}(z^{(\text{pln})},z^{(\text{str})}|x,y)=\displaystyle q_{\phi}(z^{(\text{pln})}|x^{(\text{chd})})(3)\displaystyle\prod_{c=1}^{C}q_{\phi}(z^{(\text{str})}_{c}|x^{(\text{chd})}_{\leq c},y^{(\text{chd})}_{\leq c})where x^{(\text{chd})}=\text{N2C}(e_{x}) is the chordwise embedding, and e_{x} is the notewise embedding for x. The posterior distributions of z^{(\text{pln})}_{c} and z^{(\text{str})}_{c} are approximated by distribution parameters encoded by f^{(\text{pln})}(x^{(\text{chd})}) and f^{(\text{str})}(x^{(\text{chd})},y^{(\text{chd})}), where f^{(\text{pln})} and f^{(\text{str})} are bidirectional and unidirectional recurrent neural networks, respectively.We note that z^{(\text{pln})} is independent of the score features y. This allows a flexible transfer of the explicit planning among other musical pieces. On the other hand, z^{(\text{str})} is constrained by y since the structural attributes are dependent on the note structure. Our system can render new piano performances from the scratch given a musical score. It can directly generate expressive parameters from the randomly sampled \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})}\sim p_{\theta}(z^{(\text{pln})}) and \tilde{z}^{(\text{str})}\sim p_{\theta}(z^{(\text{str})}). We note that \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})} does not have temporal dependency: each \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})}_{c} is sampled independently of \tilde{z}^{(\text{pln})}_{c-1}. Hence, we need to insert specific values \{\alpha^{(c)}\}_{c=1}^{C}, which we call as ""smooth sketches"", into the target dimensions of z^{(\text{pln})} if any temporal dependency of explicit planning is necessary. Figure 2 shows that the controlled parameters are greatly correlated with \alpha, while their local characteristics follow those of the ground truth. In addition, the black and orange lines together demonstrate granular variety in the parameters induced by different \tilde{z}^{(\text{str})} for the same musical structure.

506,Why did the authors use a polynomial function to extract explicit planning of the performance data?,"Prediction Tasks. We extract new supervisory signals for additional prediction tasks from the input data [24]. We define a signal of explicit planning I^{(\text{pln})} as a set of smoothed contours of the expressive parameters. It is extracted as a polynomial function predicted from the chordwise performance parameters k. We also derive a signal of structural attribute as I^{(\text{str})}=\text{sign}(k-I^{(\text{pln})}) which represents normalized directions of the performance parameters.We train two discriminators D^{(\text{pln})} and D^{(\text{str})} that directly receive z^{(\text{pln})} and z^{(\text{str})}, respectively. D^{(\text{pln})} is composed of A sub-discriminators where each discriminator D^{(\text{pln})}_{a} predicts a signal I^{(\text{pln})}_{a} for each expressive attribute a from z^{(\text{pln})}_{a}\in\mathbb{R}^{C\times(d^{(\text{pln})}/A)}, where z^{(\text{pln})}_{a} is a constituent part of z^{(\text{pln})}, and A is the number of expressive attributes. This setting is for a clear disentanglement among the expressive attributes. On the other hand, D^{(\text{str})} predicts the signal I^{(\text{str})} at once for all expressive attributes that belong to the same musical structure. All discriminators are jointly trained with the generative model, and the costs \mathcal{L}_{\text{pln}} and \mathcal{L}_{\text{str}} are minimized as \mathcal{L}_{\text{pln}}=\frac{1}{A}\sum_{a}\text{MSE}(D^{(\text{pln})}_{a}(z^{(\text{pln})}_{a}),I^{(\text{pln})}_{a}) and \mathcal{L}_{\text{str}}=\text{MSE}(D^{(\text{str})}(z^{(\text{str})}),I^{(\text{str})}), respectively. Therefore, we attempt a new approach that renders piano performances with flexible musical expressions.

Figure 2 shows that the controlled parameters are greatly correlated with \alpha, while their local characteristics follow those of the ground truth. In addition, the black and orange lines together demonstrate granular variety in the parameters induced by different \tilde{z}^{(\text{str})} for the same musical structure. Moreover, Figure 3 shows that our system can estimate explicit planning from arbitrary human performances, indicating that our system can derive relevant information on explicit planning from the unseen data.","The difference between the black and orange lines can be interpreted as a granular variety in the performing strategies with respect to the given musical structure by different performers.

513,What is the difference between conducting polynomial regression and predicting explicit planning with the learned representation?,"Prediction Tasks. We extract new supervisory signals for additional prediction tasks from the input data [24]. We define a signal of explicit planning I^{(\text{pln})} as a set of smoothed contours of the expressive parameters. It is extracted as a polynomial function predicted from the chordwise performance parameters k. We also derive a signal of structural attribute as I^{(\text{str})}=\text{sign}(k-I^{(\text{pln})}) which represents normalized directions of the performance parameters.We train two discriminators D^{(\text{pln})} and D^{(\text{str})} that directly receive z^{(\text{pln})} and z^{(\text{str})}, respectively. D^{(\text{pln})} is composed of A sub-discriminators where each discriminator D^{(\text{pln})}_{a} predicts a signal I^{(\text{pln})}_{a} for each expressive attribute a from z^{(\text{pln})}_{a}\in\mathbb{R}^{C\times(d^{(\text{pln})}/A)}, where z^{(\text{pln})}_{a} is a constituent part of z^{(\text{pln})}, and A is the number of expressive attributes. This setting is for a clear disentanglement among the expressive attributes. On the other hand, D^{(\text{str})} predicts the signal I^{(\text{str})} at once for all expressive attributes that belong to the same musical structure. All discriminators are jointly trained with the generative model, and the costs \mathcal{L}_{\text{pln}} and \mathcal{L}_{\text{str}} are minimized as \mathcal{L}_{\text{pln}}=\frac{1}{A}\sum_{a}\text{MSE}(D^{(\text{pln})}_{a}(z^{(\text{pln})}_{a}),I^{(\text{pln})}_{a}) and \mathcal{L}_{\text{str}}=\text{MSE}(D^{(\text{str})}(z^{(\text{str})}),I^{(\text{str})}), respectively.","Conducting polynomial regression is different from predicting explicit planning from the learned representation since polynomial regression would be based on a finite set of data in a certain length.

516,Why does negative transfer occur when learning with auxiliary tasks? ,"Pre-training with an auxiliary task is a common technique for deep neural networks.Indeed, it is the de facto standard step in natural language processing and computer vision to learn a powerful backbone networks such as BERT devlin2018bert  and ResNet he2016deep  leveraging large datasets such as BooksCorpus zhu2015aligning , English Wikipedia, and ImageNet deng2009imagenet .The models trained on the auxiliary task are often beneficial for the primary (target) task of interest.Despite the success of pre-training, few approaches have been generalized to graph-structured data due to their fundamental challenges.First, graph structure (e.g., the number of nodes/edges, and diameter) and its meaning can significantly differ between domains. So the model trained on an auxiliary task can harm generalization on the primary task, i.e., negative transfer pan2009survey .Also, many graph neural networks are transductive approaches. This often makes transfer learning between datasets inherently infeasible.So, pre-training on the target dataset has been proposed using auxiliary tasks: graph kernel  navarin2018pre , graph reconstruction zhang2020graph , and attribute masking  hu2020strategies . These assume that the auxiliary tasks for pre-training are carefully selected with substantial domain knowledge and expertise in graph characteristics to assist the primary task.Since most graph neural networks operate on homogeneous graphs, which have a single type of nodes and edges, the previous pre-training/auxiliary tasksare not specifically designed for heterogeneous graphs, which have multiple types of nodes and edges.Heterogeneous graphs commonly occur in real-world applications, for instance, a music dataset has multiple types of nodes (e.g., user, song, artist) and multiple types of relations (e.g., user-artist, song-film, song-instrument). Our framework SELAR is learning to learn a primary task with multiple auxiliary tasks to assist the primary task.This can be formally written asmin𝐰,Θ⁡𝔼⁢[ℒp⁢r⁢(𝐰∗⁢(Θ))](x,y)∼Dp⁢r⁢ s.t. ⁢𝐰∗⁢(Θ)=arg⁡min𝐰⁡𝔼⁢[ℒp⁢r+a⁢u⁢(𝐰;Θ)](x,y)∼Dp⁢r+a⁢u,\displaystyle\min_{\mathbf{w},\Theta}\;\;\underset{(x,y)\sim D^{pr}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;}{\text{\large$\mathbb{E}$}\;\;\left[\;\;\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta))\;\;\right]}\;\;\text{ s.t. }\;\;\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)=\operatorname*{\arg\!\min}_{\mathbf{w}}\underset{(x,y)\sim D^{pr+au}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;}{\;\;\mathbb{E}\;\;\left[\;\;\mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w};\Theta)\;\;\right]},roman_min start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_w , roman_Θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_UNDERACCENT ( italic_x , italic_y ) ∼ italic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_UNDERACCENT start_ARG blackboard_E [ caligraphic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( bold_w start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_Θ ) ) ] end_ARG s.t. bold_w start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_Θ ) = start_OPERATOR roman_arg roman_min end_OPERATOR start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_w end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_UNDERACCENT ( italic_x , italic_y ) ∼ italic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r + italic_a italic_u end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_UNDERACCENT start_ARG blackboard_E [ caligraphic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r + italic_a italic_u end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( bold_w ; roman_Θ ) ] end_ARG ,(2)where \mathcal{L}^{pr}(\cdot) is the primary task loss function to evaluate the trained model f(x;\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)) on meta-data (a validation for meta-learning han2018coteaching ) D^{pr} and \mathcal{L}^{pr+au} is the loss function to train a model on training data D^{pr+au} with the primary and auxiliary tasks.

We overload \ell^{t} with its function value, i.e., \ell^{t}=\ell^{t}(y_{i}^{(t,train)},f^{t}(x_{i}^{(t,train)};\mathbf{w})). \xi^{(t,train)}_{i} is the embedding vector of i_{th} sample for task t. It is the concatenation of one-hot representation of task types, the label of the sample (positive/negative), and its loss value, i.e., \xi^{(t,train)}_{i}=\left[\ell^{t};e_{t};y_{i}^{(t,train)}\right]\in\textbf{R}^{T+2}.To derive our learning algorithm,we first shorten the objective function in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) as \mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)) and \mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w};\Theta).This is equivalent to Eq. (2) without expectation.Then, our formulation is given as\min_{\mathbf{w},\Theta}\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta))\;\;\text{ s.t. }\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)=\operatorname*{\arg\!\min}_{\mathbf{w}}\mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w};\Theta),(5)To circumvent the difficulty of the bi-level optimization, as previous works MAML ; han2018coteaching  in meta-learning we approximate it with the updated parameters \hat{\mathbf{w}} using the gradient descent update as\displaystyle\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)\approx\hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k}(\Theta^{k})=\mathbf{w}^{k}-\alpha\nabla_{\mathbf{w}}\mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w}^{k};\Theta^{k}),(6)where \alpha is the learning rate for \mathbf{w}.We do not numerically evaluate \hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k}(\Theta) instead we plug the computational graph of \hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k} in \mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta)) to optimize \Theta.Let \nabla_{\Theta}\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\mathbf{w}^{\ast}(\Theta^{k})) be the gradient evaluated at \Theta^{k}.Then updating parameters \Theta is given as\displaystyle\Theta^{k+1}=\Theta^{k}-\beta\nabla_{\Theta}\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k}(\Theta^{k})),(7)where \beta is the learning rate for \Theta. This update allows softly selecting useful auxiliary tasks (meta-paths) and balance them with the primary task to improve the performance of the primary task. Without balancing tasks with the weighting function \mathcal{V}(\cdot;\Theta), auxiliary tasks can dominate training and degrade the performance of the primary task.","Negative transfer happens when the learning of an auxiliary task negatively impacts the performance of the primary task. In the case of graph-based tasks, it can happen because the graph structure, such as the number of nodes, edges, and diameter, can be vastly different between domains.

517,How did the authors design the meta-path prediction task? ,"Meta-path prediction is similar to link prediction but meta-paths allow heterogeneous composite relations.The meta-path prediction can be achieved in the same manner as link prediction.If two nodes u and v are connected by a meta-path p with the heterogeneous edges (t_{1},t_{2},\ldots t_{\ell}), then y_{u,v}^{p}=1, otherwise y_{u,v}^{p}=0. The labels can be generated from a heterogeneous graph without any manual labeling.They can be obtained by A_{p}=A_{t_{l}}\ldots A_{t_{2}}A_{t_{1}}, where A_{t} is the adjacency matrix of edge type t. The binarized value at (u,v) in A_{p} indicates whether u and v are connected with the meta-path p.In this paper, we use meta-path prediction as a self-supervised auxiliary task. Meta-Path [46, 49] is a path on a heterogeneous graph G that a sequence of nodes connected with heterogeneous edges, i.e., v1 t1 −→ v2 t2 −→ . . . tl −→ vl+1, where tl ∈ T e denotes an l-th edge type of the meta-path. The meta-path can be viewed as a composite relation R = t1 ◦ t2 . . . ◦ tl between node v1 and vl+1, where R1 ◦ R2 denotes the composition of relation R1 and R2. The definition of meta-path generalizes multi-hop connections and is shown to be useful to analyze heterogeneous graphs. For instance, in Book-Crossing dataset, ‘user-item-written.series-item-user’ indicates that a meta-path that connects users who like the same book series.","The authors designed the meta-path prediction task as a variation of link prediction. In meta-path prediction, instead of just predicting links between two nodes, the task is to predict the presence of a specific sequence of heterogeneous composite relations, called a meta-path. The prediction is done in the same way as link prediction, by assigning a binary label (1 or 0) to indicate whether the two nodes are connected by the meta-path. The labels for the task can be generated automatically from the heterogeneous graph, by calculating the product of the adjacency matrices of the edge types in the meta-path.","The limitations of SRCNN in the SISR task are:

521,Have the authors experimented with extending to other auxiliary tasks other than meta-path prediction?,"We proposed meta-path prediction as self-supervised auxiliary tasks on heterogeneous graphs.Our experiments show that the representation learning on heterogeneous graphscan benefit from meta-path prediction which encourages to capture rich semantic information.The auxiliary tasks can be further improved by our proposed method SELAR, which automatically balances auxiliary tasks to assist the primary task via a form of meta-learning.The learnt weighting function identifies more beneficial meta-paths for the primary tasks.Within a task, the weighting function can adjust the cross entropy like the focal loss, which focuses on hard examples by decreasing weights for easy samples.Moreover, when it comes to challenging and remotely relevant auxiliary tasks,our HintNet helps the learner by correcting the learner’s answer dynamically and further improves the gain from auxiliary tasks.Our framework based on meta-learning provides learning strategies to balance primary task and auxiliary tasks, and easy/hard (and positive/negative) samples.Interesting future directions include applying our framework to other domains and various auxiliary tasks.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mlvlab/SELAR. The goal of our framework is to learn with multiple auxiliary tasks to improve the performance of the primary task.In this work, we demonstrate our framework with meta-path predictions as auxiliary tasks. But our framework could be extended to include other auxiliary tasks.The meta-paths capture diverse and meaningful relations between nodes on heterogeneous graphs HAN .However, learning with auxiliary tasks has multiple challenges: identifying useful auxiliary tasks, balancing the auxiliary tasks with the primary task, and converting challenging auxiliary tasks into solvable (and relevant) tasks.To address the challenges, we propose SELf-supervised Auxiliary LeaRning (SELAR).Our framework consists of two main components:1) learning weight functions to softly select auxiliary tasks and balance them with the primary task via meta-learning, and2) learning Hint Networks to convert challenging auxiliary tasks into more relevant and solvable tasks to the primary task learner.","In this paper, the authors did not conduct experiments on extending the framework to other auxiliary tasks besides meta-path prediction. However, the authors mention that it is a possible direction for future work.","Overestimation issue in RL refers to the tendency of the agent to overestimate the value of taking an action that leads to an out-of-distribution (OOD) state, rather than the true optimal action that leads to the in-distribution (ID) state",0.1052631529085875,0.0,0.1052631529085875,1.2906729305689522,24.26451464396464,20.02783710538965,0.1458885941644562,0.010717230008244,0.0872930586338043,0.3507988678918111,0.116883710026741,0.4831596314907074,0.0199961415187105,,0.7519217758291058,0.7427644401775959
522,What is a meta-path? Please explain with examples.,"Meta-Path HAN ; sun2011pathsim  is a path on a heterogeneous graph G that a sequence of nodes connected with heterogeneous edges, i.e., {v}_{1}\xrightarrow{t_{1}}{v}_{2}\xrightarrow{t_{2}}\ldots\xrightarrow{t_{l}}{v}_{l+1},where t_{l}\in\mathcal{T}^{e} denotes an l-th edge type of the meta-path.The meta-path can be viewed as a composite relation R=t_{1}\circ t_{2}\ldots\circ t_{l} between node {v}_{1} and {v}_{l+1}, where R_{1}\circ R_{2} denotes the composition of relation R_{1} and R_{2}.The definition of meta-path generalizes multi-hop connections and is shown to be useful to analyze heterogeneous graphs.For instance, in Book-Crossing dataset, ‘user-item-written.series-item-user’ indicates that a meta-path that connects users who like the same book series. Meta-path prediction is similar to link prediction but meta-paths allow heterogeneous composite relations.The meta-path prediction can be achieved in the same manner as link prediction.If two nodes u and v are connected by a meta-path p with the heterogeneous edges (t_{1},t_{2},\ldots t_{\ell}), then y_{u,v}^{p}=1, otherwise y_{u,v}^{p}=0. The labels can be generated from a heterogeneous graph without any manual labeling.They can be obtained by A_{p}=A_{t_{l}}\ldots A_{t_{2}}A_{t_{1}}, where A_{t} is the adjacency matrix of edge type t. The binarized value at (u,v) in A_{p} indicates whether u and v are connected with the meta-path p.In this paper, we use meta-path prediction as a self-supervised auxiliary task. Meta-path prediction is generally more challenging than link prediction and node classification since it requires the understanding of long-range relations across heterogeneous nodes.The meta-path prediction gets more difficult when mini-batch training is inevitable due to the size of datasets or models.Within a mini-batch, important nodes and edges for meta-paths are not available.Also, a small learner network, e.g., two-layer GNNs, with a limited receptive field, inherently cannot capture long-range relations.The challenges can hinder representation learning and damage the generalization of the primary task.We proposed a Hint Network (HintNet) which makes the challenge tasks more solvable by correcting the answer with more information at the learner’s need.Specifically, in our experiments, the HintNet corrects the answer of the learner with its own answer from the augmented graph with hub nodes, see Fig.  2.","A meta-path is a sequence of node types and edge types in a graph that describes a specific type of relationship between nodes. An example is in a recommendation system, a meta-path could be ""user-item-written.series-item-user"" which describes a relationship between users who like the same book series.","In ancient Ayurvedic scriptures, various treatments for hair loss included herbal remedies such as Amalaki (Indian gooseberry), Brahmi, and Neem, as well as therapies like massage and steam baths",0.0655737656006453,0.0,0.0655737656006453,0.8864914124518566,21.85678228117294,17.39539461792412,0.095346289609283,0.0064031795098255,0.0018900507129728,0.3094882192381506,0.0306883621960878,0.1315857321023941,0.0077768040061249,,0.7069276145706884,0.669233465877196
523,What is the role of meta-data in the proposed method?,"Our framework SELAR is learning to learn a primary task with multiple auxiliary tasks to assist the primary task. This can be formally written as min w,Θ E [ L pr(w∗ (Θ)) ] (x,y)∼Dpr s.t. w∗ (Θ) = argmin w E L pr+au(w; Θ) (x,y)∼Dpr+au , (2) where L pr(·) is the primary task loss function to evaluate the trained model f(x; w∗ (Θ)) on metadata (a validation for meta-learning [40]) Dpr and L pr+au is the loss function to train a model on training data Dpr+au with the primary and auxiliary tasks. To avoid cluttered notation, f, x, and y are omitted. Each task Tt has Nt samples and T0 and {Tt} T t=1 denote the primary and auxiliary tasks respectively. The proposed formulation in Eq. (2) learns how to assist the primary task by optimizing Θ via meta-learning. The nested optimization problem given Θ is a regular training with properly adjusted loss functions to balance the primary and auxiliary tasks. The formulation can be more specifically written as","In the proposed method, meta-data serves as a signal to guide the update of the model's parameters in a way that improves the primary task. It is used in the outer loop of the bi-level optimization process to evaluate the performance of the model on the primary task, represented by the primary task loss function Lpr(·). In other words, meta-data is used to provide guidance for the learning process in a way that improves the primary task.","The choice of all-zero frame to denote the end of sequence is not arbitrary.

In the context of speech recognition, using an all-zero frame to indicate the end of an utterance is a common convention, as it allows the model to distinguish between the end of the utterance and the beginning of a new one. This is particularly useful when dealing with overlapping speech or when there is a pause between utterances. By using an all-zero frame, the model can be trained to recognize the end of an utterance more accurately, and to avoid confusion with the beginning of a new one",0.1599999950500001,0.0413793054306783,0.1399999950500002,1.7826069757519103,22.974711752619893,21.330236719367377,0.2073991031390134,0.011206328279499,0.1752373278141021,0.4977664763108174,0.2246250112851461,0.5220533609390259,0.0487180293792848,0.0,0.7612182601136969,0.7540737646734863
524,Why is bi-level optimization for meta-learning difficult?,"The model parameters \mathbf{w}^{k} for tasks can be updated with optimized \Theta^{k+1} in (7) as\displaystyle\mathbf{w}^{k+1}=\mathbf{w}^{k}-\alpha\nabla_{\mathbf{w}}\mathcal{L}^{pr+au}(\mathbf{w}^{k};\Theta^{k+1}).(8)Remarks. The proposed formulation can suffer from the meta-overfitting antoniou2018train ; zintgraf2018fast  meaning that the parameters \Theta to learn weights for softly selecting meta-paths and balancing the tasks with the primary task can overfit to the small meta-dataset.In our experiment, we found that the overfitting can be alleviated by meta-validation sets antoniou2018train .To learn \Theta that is generalizable across meta-training sets, we optimize \Theta across k different meta-datasets like k-fold cross validation using the following equation:Θk+1=Θk−β𝔼[∇Θℒp⁢r(𝐰^k(Θk))],Dp⁢r⁢(m⁢e⁢t⁢a)∼CV\displaystyle\Theta^{k+1}\;=\;\underset{D^{pr(meta)}\sim CV\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;}{\Theta^{k}\;-\;\;\beta\;\;\mathbb{E}\left[\;\nabla_{\Theta}\mathcal{L}^{pr}(\hat{\mathbf{w}}^{k}(\Theta^{k}))\;\right],}roman_Θ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k + 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = start_UNDERACCENT italic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r ( italic_m italic_e italic_t italic_a ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∼ italic_C italic_V end_UNDERACCENT start_ARG roman_Θ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_β blackboard_E [ ∇ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( over^ start_ARG bold_w end_ARG start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_Θ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) ) ] , end_ARG(9)where D^{pr(meta)}\sim CV is a meta-dataset from cross validation. We used 3-fold cross validation and the gradients of \Theta w.r.t different meta-datasets are averaged to update \Theta^{k}, see Algorithm 1. The cross validation is crucial to alleviate meta-overfitting and more discussion is Section 4.3. To circumvent the difficulty of the bi-level optimization, as previous works [39, 40] in meta-learning we approximate it with the updated parameters wˆ using the gradient descent update as w∗ (Θ) ≈ wˆ k (Θk ) = wk − α∇wL pr+au(wk ; Θk ), (6) where α is the learning rate for w. We do not numerically evaluate wˆ k (Θ) instead we plug the computational graph of wˆ k in L pr(w∗ (Θ)) to optimize Θ. Let ∇ΘL pr(w∗ (Θk )) be the gradient evaluated at Θk . Then updating parameters Θ is given as Θ k+1 = Θk − β∇ΘL pr(wˆ k (Θk )), (7) where β is the learning rate for Θ. This update allows softly selecting useful auxiliary tasks (metapaths) and balance them with the primary task to improve the performance of the primary task.","The goal is to optimize these parameters in a way that improves the performance of the primary task by utilizing the auxiliary tasks. The optimization process becomes difficult because the primary task and auxiliary tasks may have conflicting objectives, making it challenging to find a set of parameters that work well for both.

The proof is in the supplement. Thus, CDA is simply a similarity transformation with small jittering that cannot simulate diverse shapes and deformable objects.Unlike synthetic datasets like ModelNet [14] and ShapeNet [26], a real-world dataset like ScanObjectNN [1] further necessitates the generation of sophisticated deformations such as a mixture of local transformations.These are exemplified in Figure 1: airplanes with varying lengths and directions of wings and body, guitars in varying sizes and aspect ratios, and people with different heights and postures (e.g., crossing legs).","A realistic sample in this context refers to a 3D object that has undergone a smooth deformation, meaning that the shape of the object changes gradually rather than abruptly.

528,Why is it necessary to maximize the coverage of anchor points?,"We present a simple yet effective point cloud augmentation with weighted local transformations (PointWOLF).Our method generates deformation for point clouds by a convex combination of multiple transformations with smoothly varying weights.PointWOLF first selects several anchor points and locates random local transformations (e.g., similarity transformations) at the anchor points.Based on the distance from a point in the input to the anchor points, our method differentially applies the local transformations.The smoothly varying weights based on the distance to the anchor points allow spatially continuous augmentation and generate realistic samples.Our framework can be viewed as a kernel regression with transformations. Sampling anchor points is the first step of our framework to locate multiple local transformations.To minimize the redundancy between local transformations, the anchor points \mathcal{P}^{\mathcal{A}}\subset\mathcal{P} are selected by the Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) algorithm.FPS randomly chooses the first point and then sequentially chooses the farthest points from previous points.This maximizes the coverage of anchor points and allows diverse transformations.","Maximizing the coverage of anchor points is necessary in order to ensure that the local transformations are being applied evenly across the entire input space. This allows for a more diverse set of augmented samples to be generated, which can help to improve the robustness and generalization of a model trained on the augmented data.","The author suggests that the data used for pretraining has been under-emphasized because the performance improvements achieved by using more data (as shown in Table 4) were not fully captured in previous studies.

529,What is the difficulty of augmentation on point clouds compared to augmentation on traditional 2d images?,"Modern deep learning techniques, which established their popularity on structured data, began showing success on point clouds.Unlike images with clear lattice structures, each point cloud is an unordered set of points with no inherent structures that globally represent various 3D objects.Recent deep learning efforts have focused on enabling neural networks to operate on point clouds.While several point cloud datasets appeared, a particular dataset of scanned real-world objects [1] required a much greater understanding of the point cloud structures to identify highly complex real-world objects.In response, the approaches have evolved from extracting point-wise information with no structural information [2] to explicitly encoding the local structure [3].These works on network development have been making steady progress despite the scarcity of point cloud data.","The difficulty of augmentation on point clouds compared to traditional 2D images is primarily due to the unordered and unstructured nature of point clouds. Unlike 2D images, which have a well-defined grid structure and pixels with fixed locations, point clouds are just a collection of points in 3D space. This makes it harder to apply standard image augmentation techniques, such as rotation and scaling, to point clouds. Additionally, point clouds often have missing or incomplete data, which can make it difficult to generate realistic augmentations.","SISR has numerous applications in computer vision, including security and surveillance imaging, medical imaging, and other applications where high-resolution images are required",0.0975609720493755,0.0,0.0487804842444975,0.6359851051764895,26.573779773750704,22.524110960650425,0.0568181818181818,0.002675747993189,0.2936078906059265,0.5212282159446198,0.4178954362869262,0.590789794921875,0.023908847995583,0.0,0.7574741406012682,0.7591992252939237
530,What does non-linguistic means?,"In this paper, we explore whether pretraining on text is inherently about learning language, or if pretraining also imbues LMs with skills for symbolic manipulation and non-linguistic reasoning (for example, performing quantitative computation such as finding the median of a set of numbers, recognizing regular expressions, or identifying whether a string is a palindrome, as shown in Figure 1). In other words, we investigate whether and how pretraining develops helpful inductive biases for non-linguistic reasoning. For this analysis, we create a set of 19 tasks from three categories of task paradigms: quantitative computation (§3.1), recognizing regular expressions (§3.2), and string reasoning (§3.3). Figure 1 shows an example for each category, and the full list of tasks is described in the table 1. We experiment with transformer and RNN based LMs (§4) for learning these tasks, and perform a comparative analysis with (non-pretrained) neural model variants from the perspective of learning metrics such as accuracy and sample efficiency. Tables 2 and 3 shows the average accuracy of six non-linguistic tasks (palindrome classification, isogram classification, tautonym classification, odd even classification, decimal operation and median) fine-tuned using different BERT and DeBERTA representations respectively. We note that the models pretrained on all three domains outperformed the non-pretrained model (NP). This suggests that the results of experiments in Section 5 generalize to new text corpora for pretraining, and do not rely on having access to text on specific topics during pretraining. This is a non-trivial result, since it suggests for example, that the higher performance of pretrained models on tasks such as palindrome and anagram classification is not due to the pretrained models having seen information about such concepts during pretraining.

541,What does NILM means? Is it different to GLUE?,"Pretrained Language Models (LMs) have shown singular succcess on a range of natural language understandings tasks, to the extent that they have become foundational for contemporary NLP systems. Several works have investigated why pretraining works so well Warstadt et al. (2019); Zhao et al. (2020). In particular, studies have shown that the pretrained LMs like BERT capture linguistic knowledge about syntax Lin et al. (2019); Wu et al. (2020), semantics Vulić et al. (2020b, a) and morphology Hofmann et al. (2020, 2021). In fact, Tenney et al. (2019) demonstrated that learned representations in pretrained LMs even internally reflect the classical NLP pipeline. Since most NLP benchmarks such as SuperGLUE Wang et al. (2019) naturally are focused on tasks such as textual entailment and reading comprehension that require linguistic knowledge and reasoning, it is unsurprising that LMs have achieved strong results on these tasks. On the other hand, little work so far has explored the abilities of pretrained LMs for learning non-linguistic tasks.  In this section, we describe the tasks used for our analysis, which we refer to as NILM (measuring Non-linguistic Inductive bias in Language Models).

545,Explain the motivation of this paper,"In this paper, we explore whether pretraining on text is inherently about learning language, or if pretraining also imbues LMs with skills for symbolic manipulation and non-linguistic reasoning (for example, performing quantitative computation such as finding the median of a set of numbers, recognizing regular expressions, or identifying whether a string is a palindrome, as shown in Figure 1). In other words, we investigate whether and how pretraining develops helpful inductive biases for non-linguistic reasoning. For this analysis, we create a set of 19 tasks from three categories of task paradigms: quantitative computation (§3.1), recognizing regular expressions (§3.2), and string reasoning (§3.3). Figure 1 shows an example for each category, and the full list of tasks is described in the table 1. We experiment with transformer and RNN based LMs (§4) for learning these tasks, and perform a comparative analysis with (non-pretrained) neural model variants from the perspective of learning metrics such as accuracy and sample efficiency.",The motivation of this paper is analyzing whether pretraining on text is inherently about learning language or if pretraining inject non-linguisitc reasoning to LMs.,The hyper-parameters used to design the neural architecture search network are the number of cell repeats N and the number of filters in the initial convolutional cell,0.1395348787236345,0.0,0.0930232508166579,1.82985349484955,20.015635333634787,16.42295815876248,0.0595238095238095,0.0102778835173201,0.0923923701047897,0.3038924607861386,0.0923924222588539,0.2788068056106567,0.0066426736279234,0.0,0.7302259277075768,0.7328720528072197

551,What are the examples of offline RL algorithms that are not straightforwardly applicable to the task-oriented dialogue domain?,"Training a task-oriented conversational agent from a dialogue corpus can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine reinforcement learning (RL) problem (Levine et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020), which offers the prospect to optimize the policy solely from the ﬁxed dataset without online environment interaction. Most of the existing ofﬂine RL methods are built on the off-policy Actor- Critic framework, which performs iterative optimization of the policy (i.e. actor) and the action- value function (i.e. critic) (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Janner et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020). Yet, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods generally results in poor dialogue strategies which generate responses in no way similar to human language (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). Ofﬂine Reinforcement Learning. There have been extensive studies on ofﬂine RL (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Levine et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Most of prior works are built on the off-policy actor-critic framework, and they focus on the overestimation issue by taking the OOD actions (Kumar et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020). However, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods suffer from the issue of diverging from human language in the task-oriented dialogues (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). On the other hand, there are a number of recent works on weighted behavior cloning, where a policy is trained by a variant of supervised learning loss (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). The weighted behavior cloning approaches ﬁlter out bad actions, then perform behavior cloning on high-quality data. However, in the task-oriented dialogues, simply dropping the unsuccessful dialogues from the corpus is undesirable, since they may contain some task-speciﬁc information that is useful to properly respond to user requests. Our GPT-Critic aims to revise unsuccessful dialogues into successful ones, which is in contrast to the weighted behavior cloning on the ﬁxed training dataset, where the action choice is restricted to the support in the dataset (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). More recently, Chen et al. (2021) introduce Decision Transformer, a Transformer-based architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. These ofﬂine RL methods based on behavior cloning are directly applied to the task-oriented dialogues without aforementioned issue, but their results are similar to that of behavior cloning in the task-oriented dialogues.",Most of the algorithms based on the policy gradient such as actor-critic are not straightforwardly applicable to the task-oriented dialogue domain,"Controlling the variance of the encoder distribution q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) allows for a more precise control over the level of overlap between the encoded datapoints, as increasing the variance increases the range of possible encodings and can lead to a better match between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right)",0.15384614920858,0.0322580601456821,0.1153846107470416,0.1221893533450048,13.122976740322583,11.90356158204447,0.1107011070110701,0.011156186612576,-0.0108833853155374,0.3281779479649331,-0.0108832539990544,0.3020333349704742,0.0159117798674528,,0.7220090000541107,0.73506197483243

It consists of 8438/1000/1000 dialogues for training/validation/testing. For end-to-end evaluation on the MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset, we use the following automatic evaluation metrics: 1) In- form : evaluates whether the system provides an appropriate entity, 2) Success : evaluates whether the system answers all the requested information, 3) BLEU : measures the ﬂuency of the generated response (Papineni et al., 2002). We also report the Combined Score as an overall quality measure In order to evaluate the performance of dialogue agents in an end-to-end fashion, we conduct simulator-based evaluation on ConvLab (Zhu et al., 2020). ConvLab is an open-source toolkit that enables to build task-oriented dialogue systems and perform an end-to-end evaluation. The simulator-based evaluation is more reliable than dataset-based automatic evaluation because it eval- uates the performance while interacting with the user simulator. To interact with dialogue systems, ConvLab provides an agenda-based user simulator (Schatzmann et al., 2007) that consists of a BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) for NLU, a rule-based policy, and a template-based NLG. We compare the per- formance of GPT-Critic with baseline algorithms interacting with the same user simulator and user goals.

First, we evaluate the performances of GPT-Critic on the MultiWOZ 2.0 (Budzianowski et al., 2018) as dataset-based automatic evaluation, compared with baseline methods including ofﬂine RL algorithms. Second, for more realistic evaluation, we conduct a simulator-based evaluation on the ConvLab framework (Zhu et al., 2020). Third, we also conduct the human eval- uation to evaluate the quality of generated responses. Finally, we give a qualitative analysis of our method using generated dialogue examples on the training dataset of MultiWOZ 2.0, which shows how GPT-Critic improves the performance through the behavior cloning of self-generated dialogues.

557,They claim that the proposed algorithm can maintain the GPT-2’s ability to generate human-like responses while improving the task performance. Is this true?,"Table 3 summarizes the overall performance of GPT-Critic and baseline algorithms in end-to-end response generation setting, where the generated dialogue state and generated dialogue act are used for the DB search and response generation. The results show that GPT-Critic achieved the best performance in terms of inform rate, success rate, and combined score. Moreover, the performance of GPT-Critic on the BLEU score matches those of other pre-trained LM-based methods, since GPT-Critic inherits GPT-2’s ability to generate human-like responses through the behavior cloning of responses generated by GPT-2. The results show that GPT-Critic improves the task performance of the agent without the issue of diverging from human language. In addition, as can be shown in Table 3, the naive data augmentation is not effective since it will not change the GPT’s sampling distribution in principle. We also conduct human evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess the quality of gen- erated responses of GPT-Critic and baseline algorithms, using the evaluation protocol as in (Yang et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Speciﬁcally, human workers on AMT were asked to read the context and generated response by interactive simulation via ConvLab, then score the following two evaluation metrics on a Likert scale (1-5): 1) Appropriateness : evaluates whether the generated responses are appropriate for the given context, 2) Fluency : evaluates whether the gen- erated responses are comprehensible and human-like. We compare the performance of GPT-Critic with same baselines on ConvLab evaluation. Figure 3 summarizes the overall results of human eval- uation, where 60 workers evaluate the quality of 30 randomly selected dialogues for each algorithm.

562,What is “overestimation issue” in RL?,"where ¯ φ is the parameters of the target network. As discussed in the prior work (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020), optimizing this loss can be challenging in the ofﬂine RL setting due to the overestimation issue in the bootstrapping process by taking out-of-distribution (OOD) actions to evaluate the value of the next state. Ofﬂine Reinforcement Learning. There have been extensive studies on ofﬂine RL (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Levine et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Most of prior works are built on the off-policy actor-critic framework, and they focus on the overestimation issue by taking the OOD actions (Kumar et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020). However, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods suffer from the issue of diverging from human language in the task-oriented dialogues (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). On the other hand, there are a number of recent works on weighted behavior cloning, where a policy is trained by a variant of supervised learning loss (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). The weighted behavior cloning approaches ﬁlter out bad actions, then perform behavior cloning on high-quality data. However, in the task-oriented dialogues, simply dropping the unsuccessful dialogues from the corpus is undesirable, since they may contain some task-speciﬁc information that is useful to properly respond to user requests. Our GPT-Critic aims to revise unsuccessful dialogues into successful ones, which is in contrast to the weighted behavior cloning on the ﬁxed training dataset, where the action choice is restricted to the support in the dataset (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020).

Building an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue agent is one of the promising applications of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet challenging due to large language action spaces and limited availability of human-annotated data. Recently, large-scale pre-trained language models (LM) have achieved remarkable successes in various NLP tasks with prohibitively large vocabulary (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2019). The current best performing end-to-end conversational agents for a task-oriented dialogue system utilize a pre-training on large- scale corpus and ﬁne-tuning on downstream tasks (Ham et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021). This combination of pre-training and ﬁne-tuning signiﬁcantly improves overall performance in the task-oriented dialogues. However, supervised ﬁne-tuning (i.e. imitation learning of the dialogue corpus) alone may not be sufﬁcient to learn an optimal dialogue strategy since the corpus often contains suboptimal dialogues collected from human participants of diverse expertise levels. Thus, in order to optimize the task performance of the conversational agent, goal- oriented training (i.e. reinforcement learning) is an essential and promising direction to pursue.

569,Why are most of the existing offline RL algorithms not straightforward to apply to the task-oriented dialogue?,"Training a task-oriented conversational agent from a dialogue corpus can be naturally formulated as ofﬂine reinforcement learning (RL) problem (Levine et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020), which offers the prospect to optimize the policy solely from the ﬁxed dataset without online environment interaction. Most of the existing ofﬂine RL methods are built on the off-policy Actor- Critic framework, which performs iterative optimization of the policy (i.e. actor) and the action- value function (i.e. critic) (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Janner et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020). Yet, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods generally results in poor dialogue strategies which generate responses in no way similar to human language (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). Reinforcement Learning for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems. Applying the standard RL meth- ods straightforwardly to optimize a task-oriented dialogue agent causes the issue of diverging from human language. To address this problem, interleaving reinforcement learning with supervised learning has been proposed but it is still not free from the issue of diverging from human language (Lewis et al., 2017). Recently, the latent representation models for language actions have been in- troduced to address the aforementioned problem (Zhao et al., 2019; Yarats & Lewis, 2018). They disentangle the semantics of the utterance and the natural language generation, and then perform goal-based training in the space of the latent variables instead of directly optimizing utterances. However, they cannot be directly applied to large-scale pre-trained language models that are not designed in a way that works inherently with discrete latent variables. Jaques et al. (2020) use KL- control to restrict the policy to stay close to its prior policy, but it still suffers from divergence from human language even with carefully chosen hyper-parameters. Furthermore, Jang et al. (2020) adopt Bayes-adaptive Monte-Carlo planning to negotiation dialogue then use it as a policy improvement operator. This approach can prevent the issue of diverging from human language through the policy improvement based on behavior cloning of self-generated dialogues. However, they assume a user model that is difﬁcult enough to be considered another problem. Ofﬂine Reinforcement Learning. There have been extensive studies on ofﬂine RL (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Levine et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Most of prior works are built on the off-policy actor-critic framework, and they focus on the overestimation issue by taking the OOD actions (Kumar et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Fujimoto et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020). However, a naive application of these ofﬂine RL methods suffer from the issue of diverging from human language in the task-oriented dialogues (Lewis et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020). On the other hand, there are a number of recent works on weighted behavior cloning, where a policy is trained by a variant of supervised learning loss (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). The weighted behavior cloning approaches ﬁlter out bad actions, then perform behavior cloning on high-quality data. However, in the task-oriented dialogues, simply dropping the unsuccessful dialogues from the corpus is undesirable, since they may contain some task-speciﬁc information that is useful to properly respond to user requests. Our GPT-Critic aims to revise unsuccessful dialogues into successful ones, which is in contrast to the weighted behavior cloning on the ﬁxed training dataset, where the action choice is restricted to the support in the dataset (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2020). More recently, Chen et al. (2021) introduce Decision Transformer, a Transformer-based architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. These ofﬂine RL methods based on behavior cloning are directly applied to the task-oriented dialogues without aforementioned issue, but their results are similar to that of behavior cloning in the task-oriented dialogues.","Since a naive application of existing offline RL algorithms suffer from the issue of diverging from human language, it is not straightforward to apply them to the task-oriented dialogue.","Sure!

First, we evaluate the performances of GPT-Critic on the MultiWOZ 2.0 (Budzianowski et al., 2018) as dataset-based automatic evaluation, compared with baseline methods including ofﬂine RL algorithms. Second, for more realistic evaluation, we conduct a simulator-based evaluation on the ConvLab framework (Zhu et al., 2020). Third, we also conduct the human eval- uation to evaluate the quality of generated responses. Finally, we give a qualitative analysis of our method using generated dialogue examples on the training dataset of MultiWOZ 2.0, which shows how GPT-Critic improves the performance through the behavior cloning of self-generated dialogues. The qualitative analysis with generated dialogue examples can be found in Appendix B. We also conduct human evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess the quality of gen- erated responses of GPT-Critic and baseline algorithms, using the evaluation protocol as in (Yang et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Speciﬁcally, human workers on AMT were asked to read the context and generated response by interactive simulation via ConvLab, then score the following two evaluation metrics on a Likert scale (1-5): 1) Appropriateness : evaluates whether the generated responses are appropriate for the given context, 2) Fluency : evaluates whether the gen- erated responses are comprehensible and human-like. We compare the performance of GPT-Critic with same baselines on ConvLab evaluation. Figure 3 summarizes the overall results of human eval- uation, where 60 workers evaluate the quality of 30 randomly selected dialogues for each algorithm.

Table 2 reports the intermediate results of planning and supervised learning in each iteration of the policy iteration. In each iteration, the policy and the Q-function are trained using planning trajectories and experience replay collected from 25 independent planning agents. As can be seen in Table 2, the performance of MC-LAVE-RL is improved more consistently than PUCT-RL, both in planning and learning. At the beginning of the policy iteration, PUCT-RL improves the performance, but it fails to overcome bottleneck and converges to a suboptimal policy: PUCT utilizes the prior policy learned by imitating the planning results of the previous iteration to estimate the exploration bonus, but this uncertainty-based method is not much effective to encourage the agent to explore the action space that is not sufﬁciently covered.

579,Is it possible to say the proposed method learns better representation? What is the meaning of the downstream tasks?,"There has been a growing interest in using a large-scale dataset to build powerful machine learning models Radford et al. (2021).Self-supervised learning (SSL), which aims to learn a useful representation without labels, is suitable for this trend; it is actively studied in the fields of natural language processing Devlin et al. (2019); Du et al. (2021) and computer vision Chen et al. (2020a); He et al. (2020).In the vision domain, recent SSL methods commonly use data augmentations and induce their visual representation to be augmentation-invariant.They have achieved state-of-the-art performance surpassing supervised representation in a variety of visual tasks, including semi-supervised learning Caron et al. (2020); Zbontar et al. (2021), transfer learning Ericsson et al. (2021), and object detection Chen et al. (2020c). We apply MIRA to clustering-based representation learning and verify the representation quality on several standard self-supervised learning benchmarks.We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance on linear/k-NN evaluation, semi-supervised learning, and transfer learning benchmark.We further experiment with convergence speed, scalability, and different components of our method. SSL methods are designed to learn the representation by solving pretext tasks, and recent state-of-the-art methods encourage their learned representations to be augmentation invariant.They are based on various pretext tasks: instance discrimination Chen et al. (2020a, b, c, 2021), metric learning Grill et al. (2020); Chen and He (2021), self-training Zheng et al. (2021); Caron et al. (2021), and clustering Asano et al. (2020); Caron et al. (2018, 2020); only a few account for encoding the semantic structure of data.While some works Wang et al. (2020); Dwibedi et al. (2021); Koohpayegani et al. (2021) consider the nearest neighbors in the latent space, our method belongs to the clustering-based SSL method that flexibly accounts for inter-data similarity.Meanwhile, many SSL methods are prone to collapsing into a trivial solution where every representation is mapped into a constant vector.Various schemes and mechanisms are suggested to address this, e.g., the asymmetric structure, redundancy reduction, etc.We will review more relevant works in detail below.","SSL methods learn useful representation by solving pretext tasks without labels. In P7, we can get a hint that this benchmarks are testbed for evaluating SSL methods.","The link prediction task requires decoder modules because it involves predicting new facts (triples) between entities, which requires generating new edges in the graph.

581,How does the proposed method address the issue of cluster collapse?,"The MI term in Eq. 4 takes a minimum value when collapsing happens.MIRA naturally avoids collapsed solution via penalizing assignment that exhibits low MI.Specifically, unless starting from the collapsed state, MIRA finds MI-maximizing points around the model prediction; it will not choose collapsed pseudo-labels.Hence, the iterative training to predict such labels will not collapse whenever the prediction of pseudo-labels is achievable.Our empirical results verify that MIRA does not require extra training techniques or artificial constraints to address collapsing.",Mutual information regularizer unfavors collapsed representation.,"Sure!

582,How does the cluster-based method learn meaningful representation from scratch?,"Meanwhile, a line of work uses clustering for un-/self-supervised representation learning.They explicitly assign pseudo-labels to embedded representation via clustering, and the model is thereby trained to predict such labels.These clustering-based methods can account for inter-data similarity; representations are encouraged to encode the semantic structure of data.Prior works Yang et al. (2016); Xie et al. (2016); Bautista et al. (2016); Hu et al. (2017) have shown encouraging results in small-scaled settings; Caron et al. (2018) show that it can also be applied to the large-scaled dataset or even to a non-curated dataset Caron et al. (2019).Recently, several works Asano et al. (2020); Caron et al. (2020); Li et al. (2021) have adopted the philosophy of augmentation invariance and achieved strong empirical results.They typically assign pseudo-labels using augmented views while predicting the labels by looking at other differently augmented views. Despite its conceptual simplicity, a naive application of clustering to representation learning is hard to achieve, especially when training with large-scale datasets.This is because clustering-based methods are prone to collapse, i.e., all samples are assigned to a single cluster; hence, recent methods heavily rely on extra training techniques or artificial constraints, such as pre-training Yan et al. (2020), sampling strategy Caron et al. (2018), equipartition constraints Asano et al. (2020); Caron et al. (2020), to avoid collapsing.However, it is unclear if these additions are appropriate or how such components will affect the representation quality. Many SSL approaches rely on extra training techniques and artificial assumptions to prevent collapsing.In clustering-based methods, DeepCluster Caron et al. (2018) adapts a sampling strategy to sample elements uniformly across pseudo-labels to deal with empty clusters; SeLa Asano et al. (2020) and SwAV Caron et al. (2020) impose equipartition constraints to balance the cluster distribution.Similarly, SelfClassifier Amrani et al. (2021) uses a uniform pseudo-label prior, and PCL Li et al. (2021) employs concentration scaling.DINO Caron et al. (2021) and ReSSL Zheng et al. (2021) address collapsing by specific combinations of implementation details, i.e., centering and scaling with an exponential moving average network; their mechanism for preventing collapse is unclear.In this work, we show our method can naturally avoid collapsing without any of these assumptions or training techniques.We achieve results better than baselines with a simple but novel information regularization algorithm.We take a more detailed comparison with SeLa and SwAV after explaining our method in Sec. 3.3.","Clustering methods encourage the representations to encode the semantic structures of the data.

589,How is MIRA different to TWIST fundamentally?,"In this paper, we propose Mutual Information Regularized Assignment (MIRA), a pseudo-labeling algorithm that enables clustering-based SSL without any artificial constraints or extra training techniques.MIRA is designed to follow the infomax principle Linsker (1988) and the intuition that good labels are something that can reduce most of the uncertainty about the data.Our method assigns a pseudo-label in a principled way by constructing an optimization problem.For a given training model that predicts pseudo-labels, the optimization problem finds a solution that maximizes the mutual information (MI) between the pseudo-labels and data while considering the model probability.We formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem and derive the necessary and sufficient condition of solution with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition.This solution can be achieved by fixed-point iteration that we prove the convergence.We remark that MIRA does not require any form of extra training techniques or artificial constraints, e.g., equipartition constraints.

In Table 3 we compare perplexity and end-task performance of BERT{}_{\textsc{base}} as we increase the batch size, controlling for the number of passes through the training data.We observe that training with large batches improves perplexity for the masked language modeling objective, as well as end-task accuracy.Large batches are also easier to parallelize via distributed data parallel training,888Large batch training can improve training efficiency even without large scale parallel hardware through gradient accumulation, whereby gradients from multiple mini-batches are accumulated locally before each optimization step.

612,Why does zero-shot evaluation has been suggested as a genuine measure for reasoning capability?,"The ability to understand natural language through commonsense reasoning is one of the core focuses in the field of natural language processing. To measure and study the different aspects of commonsense reasoning, several datasets are developed, such as SocialIQA (Sap et al., 2019b), CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018), and PhysicalIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), each requiring different type of commonsense knowledge (e.g., social, taxonomic, causal, declarative, etc) to select the correct answer. While large-scale neural systems (Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019b) have shown human-level accuracy on these benchmarks, recent studies (Mitra et al., 2019) also criticize that these models solve individual datasets, rather than learning how to perform general semantic reasoning. To this end, Ma et al. (2021) suggested zero-shot evaluation as a genuine measure for the reasoning capability of the machine.",It is hard to measure reasoning capability using individual datasets because the model cannot learn how to perform general semantic reasoning.,"Larger values of β can lead to an increase in the level of overlap between the latent dimensions, but can also cause the encodings to collapse to a mode and result in a mismatch between the approximate posterior and the prior",0.0833333285503475,0.0,0.0833333285503475,0.9158318896571336,20.87595339065122,16.64963138682603,0.0803212851405622,0.0106743035667794,0.0123614743351936,0.4716665686086843,0.0123616131022572,0.4941574037075043,0.0113294469553491,0.0,0.7461790436212506,0.7647149188893575
613,What is AdapterFusion?,"To address these limitations, we propose a novel, modularized framework that aims to learn multiple expert models for KGs, then conduct zero-shot fusion to allow collaboration among KGs. For this purpose, we leverage AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) where multiple tiny modules between Transformer blocks called adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019) can be combined after independent training, thus allowing a continual integration of the adapters without retraining the entire framework. Specifically, we treat the adapters as different KG-specific experts, and combine them using an attention-like fusion module. To improve the fusion of adapters, we suggest a KG-alignment adapter that guides to the apt expert adapters. Here, we use KGs in three different synthetic supervision training: (1) KG-specific QA datasets to train the KG-specific expert adapters, (2) a KG classification datasets to train the KG-alignment adapter, and (3) a balanced mixture of KG-specific QA datasets to train the fusion module. Our modularized method alleviates the interference between different KGs, which is the pitfall of MTL from our empirical observation, and thus combines multiple KGs into a synergetic zero-shot framework. To address this problem, AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) has been proposed to fuse task specific parameters called adapters for the given target task leveraging attention-like mechanism. AdapterFusion aggregates adapters, which is trained independently for each task, in a non-destructive manner mitigating aforementioned MTL problems such as forgetting and interference between tasks. Recently, it has been used for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer framework (Pfeiffer et al., 2020c; Wang et al., 2021b), which motivates our work to transfer multi-source knowledge with less interference for zero-shot commonsense reasoning.",AdapterFusion is one of the multi-task learning method based on attention-like mechanism.

614,How do the authors generate synthetic QA?,"In our setup, we repurpose synthetic QA generation (Ma et al., 2021) for the task of knowledge-driven zero-shot learning for commonsense reasoning, i.e., we transform a KG into multiple (Q_{i},A_{i}) pairs where Q_{i} is a natural language question and A_{i}=\{A_{i,1},...,A_{i,m}\} is the set of options with m answer candidates. Specifically, given a triple (e^{head},r,e^{tail}) in a KG, where e^{head}, e^{tail} and r denote head/tail entity and relation respectively, we transform e^{head} and r into a natural language question Q_{i} using templates. For the option set A_{i}, we use the combination of the correct answer e^{tail} and m-1 distractors which are tail entities from other triples sampled randomly (Ma et al., 2021). Details are described in Appendix B.","They generate syntheticQS by transforming a triplet of KG into question and answer pair.

615,What is the main weak point of conventional Multi-task learning for zero-shot learning with multiple types of commonsense knowledge? ,"To consider different types of reasoning, this paper extends ideas from the aforementioned zero-shot learning to the multi-source case such that it benefits from different types of commonsense knowledge on individual KGs. For example, ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019a) focuses on social commonsense while ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) contains conceptual knowledge. A practical approach is multi-task learning (MTL; Caruana, 1997; Liu et al., 2019a), which learns a shared encoder for different synthetic QA datasets from multiple KGs. Despite its effectiveness, MTL scheme suffers from interference among different KGs, which results in forgetting previously learned knowledge when trained on new KG which has different kinds of knowledge (Pilault et al., 2021; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a; Wu et al., 2020). MTL (Liu et al., 2019a; Zhang and Yang, 2017; Caruana, 1997) learns a shared representation while aggregating knowledge across multiple learning tasks, often leading to better generalization ability of a model. However, parametric aggregation of knowledge with MTL has following limitations: (1) retraining the full model when adding new tasks (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2021, 2020b) (2) catastrophic forgetting and interference between tasks leading to difficulties of solving each task equally well (Pilault et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020) and (3) inconsistent effect (Lourie et al., 2021). To deal with these challenges, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a parameterized generalization of ensembling techniques, which has been adapted for MTL with gating network trained to optimize each task (Ma et al., 2018).

Considering the importance of using a suitable and well-aligned KG (Ma et al., 2019, 2021) on a downstream task, the subtle difference between each KG should be learned by the model without any interference from each other. Accordingly, we adopt the adapter module (Houlsby et al., 2019) which repurposes a pre- trained language model (PLM) to incorporate each KG as tiny modules in between Transformer blocks. Specifically, as illustrated in Figure 2 (except for green area), the adapter training strategy involves injecting new layers (parameterized by Φ) into the original PLM (parameterized by θ). The weights of the original PLM are untouched, while the new adapter layers are initialized at random. Formally, we call each adapter trained with DkQA as an expert adapter for KG k, parameterized by ΦkQA.","KG modularization is crucial for maintaining the intrinsic knowledge of each individual KG.

618,How does the author show the mitigation of interference?,"Using the interference ratio, we can precisely compare the negative effects of multi-KG models on knowledge aggregation since the only reason to get the correct samples wrong is the interference caused by learning with additional KGs.

619,What is the difference between zero-shot fusion and original AdapterFusion?,"Once the expert adapters are learned, we combine the knowledge from each expert adapter using an attention-like mechanism. We present a novel fusion strategy as shown in Figure 2, which is referred to as the zero-shot fusion. In contrast to AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) where the focus islearning to transfer knowledge to a specific targettask, our zero-shot fusion aims to generalize this transfer to any arbitrary target task. Specifically, the zero-shot fusion parameters Ψ learn to combine fixed expert adapters which are parameterized by Φ_1 QA, ..., Φ K QA. In each Transformer layer l of PLM with the injected fusion layer, the zero-shot fusion parameters ΨQA consist of query, key, and value matrices, denoted by WQ_l, WK_l, and WV_l respectively. These parameters are used to learn the balancing between the representation of each expert adapters through attention-like mechanism. While fixing both the parameters θ and all expert adapters Φ_1 QA, ..., Φ_K QA, the only trainable weights ΨQA on the fusion layer learns to combine the knowledge from different K expert adapters by using the subset of {Dk QA} K k=1 by random sampling. Here, we balance the ratio between the K knowledge-driven datasets as N samples (details are in Appendix D).","In contrast to AdapterFusion where the focus is learning to transfer knowledge to a specific target task, our zero-shot fusion aims to generalize this transfer to any arbitrary target task.","YOLO makes far fewer background errors than Fast R-CNN.

The column of the darker cell indicates the adapter that has the bigger influence on the fused representation. We can observe that zero-shot fusion with KG-C adapter fuses the knowledge from different experts with a subtle difference rather than focusing on a single expert severely. This implies that KG-C adapter enables the delicate balancing between multiple knowledge sources based on the KG-alignment awareness, which leads to performance improvements in commonsense reasoning tasks.

629,What are the limitations of the parametric aggregation of knowledge with MTL?,"To consider different types of reasoning, this paper extends ideas from the aforementioned zero-shot learning to the multi-source case such that it benefits from different types of commonsense knowledge on individual KGs. For example, ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019a) focuses on social commonsense while ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) contains conceptual knowledge. A practical approach is multi-task learning (MTL; Caruana, 1997; Liu et al., 2019a), which learns a shared encoder for different synthetic QA datasets from multiple KGs. Despite its effectiveness, MTL scheme suffers from interference among different KGs, which results in forgetting previously learned knowledge when trained on new KG which has different kinds of knowledge (Pilault et al., 2021; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a; Wu et al., 2020). MTL (Liu et al., 2019a; Zhang and Yang, 2017; Caruana, 1997) learns a shared representation while aggregating knowledge across multiple learning tasks, often leading to better generalization ability of a model. However, parametric aggregation of knowledge with MTL has following limitations: (1) retraining the full model when adding new tasks (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2021, 2020b) (2) catastrophic forgetting and interference between tasks leading to difficulties of solving each task equally well (Pilault et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020) and (3) inconsistent effect (Lourie et al., 2021). To deal with these challenges, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a parameterized generalization of ensembling techniques, which has been adapted for MTL with gating network trained to optimize each task (Ma et al., 2018). However, simple linear gating networks are too shallow and thus may destruct task knowledge for commonsense reasoning. To address this problem, AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) has been proposed to fuse task specific parameters called adapters for the given target task leveraging attention-like mechanism. AdapterFusion aggregates adapters, which is trained independently for each task, in a non-destructive manner mitigating aforementioned MTL problems such as forgetting and interference between tasks. Recently, it has been used for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer framework (Pfeiffer et al., 2020c; Wang et al., 2021b), which motivates our work to transfer multi-source knowledge with less interference for zero-shot commonsense reasoning.",(1) retraining the full model when adding new tasks (2) catastrophic forgetting and interference between tasks leading to difficulties of solving each task equally well and (3) inconsistent effect,"Lower FVD value does not necessarily mean more coherent generation.

FVD (Frame-to-Video Distance) is a metric that measures the difference between the generated video and the target video. A lower FVD value indicates that the generated video is more similar to the target video. However, a low FVD value does not necessarily guarantee that the generated video is coherent.

Coherence is a subjective measure that depends on the quality of the generated video, the relevance of the generated video to the input text, and the overall aesthetic appeal of the video. A coherent video should have a clear narrative, consistent motion, and visually appealing elements. It should also be grounded in the input text and maintain a consistent tone and style throughout.

In the context of T2V (Text-to-Video) generation, coherence is particularly important because it directly affects the quality of the generated video. A coherent video is more likely to engage the viewer and convey the intended message effectively.

Therefore, while a low FVD value is a good starting point for evaluating the quality of a generated video, it is not the only factor that determines coherence. Human evaluation and subjective assessment are also crucial for evaluating the quality and coherence of a generated video",0.0793650759977325,0.0,0.0793650759977325,0.0077846096993553,7.978560968967281,6.518228413639353,0.1199261992619926,0.0100960354592464,0.0842011868953704,0.4703117065219077,0.1308876425027847,0.3265028297901153,0.0263618330743163,0.4,0.7322701523549772,0.6967017960345133
630,How does the author convert the triplet in KG into synthetic QA specifically?,"In our setup, we repurpose synthetic QA generation (Ma et al., 2021) for the task of knowledge-driven zero-shot learning for commonsense reasoning, i.e., we transform a KG into multiple (Q_{i},A_{i}) pairs where Q_{i} is a natural language question and A_{i}=\{A_{i,1},...,A_{i,m}\} is the set of options with m answer candidates. Specifically, given a triple (e^{head},r,e^{tail}) in a KG, where e^{head}, e^{tail} and r denote head/tail entity and relation respectively, we transform e^{head} and r into a natural language question Q_{i} using templates. For the option set A_{i}, we use the combination of the correct answer e^{tail} and m-1 distractors which are tail entities from other triples sampled randomly (Ma et al., 2021). Details are described in Appendix B.","given a triple (e^{head},r,e^{tail}) in a KG, where e^{head}, e^{tail} and r denote head/tail entity and relation respectively, we transform e^{head} and r into a natural language question Q_{i} using templates.",mAP (mean Average Precision),0.0,0.0,0.0,0.641999201938103,10.769023322182122,9.07198907120209,0.0186219739292365,0.0012886597938144,-0.0117815639823675,0.5440372700492542,-0.0117815192788839,0.2412065118551254,0.0007454725021351,0.0,0.7252574118579608,0.7276371549816727
631,What does MTL stand for?,"MTL (Liu et al., 2019a; Zhang and Yang, 2017; Caruana, 1997) learns a shared representation while aggregating knowledge across multiple learning tasks, often leading to better generalization ability of a model. However, parametric aggregation of knowledge with MTL has following limitations: (1) retraining the full model when adding new tasks (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2021, 2020b) (2) catastrophic forgetting and interference between tasks leading to difficulties of solving each task equally well (Pilault et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020) and (3) inconsistent effect (Lourie et al., 2021). To deal with these challenges, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a parameterized generalization of ensembling techniques, which has been adapted for MTL with gating network trained to optimize each task (Ma et al., 2018). However, simple linear gating networks are too shallow and thus may destruct task knowledge for commonsense reasoning. Paragraph10 : Multi-Task Learning (MTL): The model is pre-trained on multiple synthetic QA datasets, each of which is generated from a KG. We experiment with a PLM trained on all four aforementioned synthetic QA datasets.

In both framework, the slightly degraded performance of the combination of KGs without ATOMIC could be due to the strong alignment between ATOMIC and SIQA.

This demonstrates that our method enables knowledge aggregation for multiple KGs synergetically.","In both framework, the slightly degraded performance of the combination of KGs without ATOMIC could be due to the strong alignment between ATOMIC and SIQA.","N, the number of disjoint sets of proposals, is determined based on the annotation nature of the specific CIC dataset",0.1081081031994158,0.0465116229745813,0.1081081031994158,4.344109103419242,23.42045100393684,21.967319445066373,0.1320754716981132,0.0094339622641509,0.0836124494671821,0.3369995320970947,0.0836124718189239,0.3530694842338562,0.0064711714968884,0.0,0.7160478060926055,0.7478637068448732
634,What is the main motivation of this work?,"Inspired by this new metric, in this work, we focus on building unsupervised zero-shot multiple-choice QA systems. That is, we target an arbitrary commonsense reasoning task where conventional approaches (that rely heavily on task-specific supervision) are not applicable to such zero-shot learning scenarios. To learn QA models without expensive annotation efforts, recent works (Ma et al., 2021; Banerjee and Baral, 2020; Malaviya et al., 2020) propose to generate a synthetic QA dataset using a commonsense KG such as ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019a) and ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017). Such an approach mostly focuses only on one specific type of reasoning relations (e.g., if-then relation, or declarative relation), neglecting the fact that real-world QA systems require simultaneously considering different types of reasoning abilities (e.g., declarative and social, or causal and physical reasoning; Ilievski et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2021).","This work has been motivated from the fact that real-world QA systems require simultaneously considering different types of reasoning abilities.

638,How does the authors claim that the proposed method could improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff over existing SoTA CNN models?,"We apply the proposed NAS method with the supernet architecture described above. The depth of 5 stages is set to 3,4,7,4,11, respectively. The latency constraint is set to 2.5 ms that corresponds to the latency of EfficientNet-B1 on our target NPU, MIDAP. Table 6 compares our search results with the state-of-the-art models: EdgeTPU (Gupta and Akin, 2020), EfficientNet (Tan and Le, 2019a), Once-For-All (Cai et al., 2019). The latency of the other models is obtained by running the network on the MIDAP cycle-accurate simulator. We compare the accuracy without quantization, assuming that quantization effects will be similar to all models. As shown in Table 6, the baseline model, ours-M, found by the proposed NAS technique has higher accuracy than the other models on our target NPU; ours-M achieves more than 1.7% higher top-1 accuracy than EfficientNet-lite2 with similar latency. Moreover, it is 0.5% higher than EfficientNet-B1, even without using SE and h-swish activation function. Note that the number of parameters and the number of FLOPS in ours-M is larger than EfficientNet-B1. It implies that the complexity of the network is not a direct indicator of the end-to-end latency of the network. The end-to-end latency depends on the NPU architecture, and the proposed NAS technique could find a larger network with shorter latency by adding the latency factor to the loss function directly. The main benefit comes from different block assignment to stages. Finally, we selectively removed SE blocks from ours-XL+, resulting in ours-XL-rmSE+. We collected the activation values using randomly sampled 10K images from the training dataset and calculated the metric explained in Sec. 4.3.3.After removing SE blocks from ours-XL+ based on the metric, only about 60% of the blocks in the network have SE blocks. As a result, we could make the latency shorter, while the accuracy was slightly improved than ours-XL+. This model achieves 82.72% top-1 accuracy with only 11.66ms latency.It is much better than EfficientNet-EdgeTPU-L (Gupta and Akin, 2020) that achieves 80.62% FP32 top-1 accuracy with more than 20ms on EdgeTPU. Our architecture on MIDAP is about 2 times faster with 2.1% higher accuracy. In this work, we propose a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology extending the Single-Path NAS technique (Stamoulis et al., 2019). We modify the supernet architecture by varying the number of blocks in stages and adding mixed depthwise convolution (Tan and Le, 2019b) to the search space. By modifying the loss function to directly include the target latency estimated by a cycle-accurate simulator of the target NPU, we could find a better baseline architecture with a shorter latency than the latency constraint. Using a tight latency constraint, we can reduce the search space to find the baseline network fast. Afterward, we apply compound scaling to find a larger network than the baseline network, and add SE blocks and h-swish activation functions in the post-processing step.Through the proposed NAS methodology, we could obtain a network with 82.72% accuracy with 11.66ms latency on our target NPU, without special data augmentation in training. It dominates the existing network models on the target NPU. It confirms the importance of supernet architecture design for a given NPU and effectiveness of the three-step approach in the proposed NAS methodology: supernet design, SinglePath NAS with a tighter latency constraint, and compound scaling and post-processing. Experiments show that the proposed NAS technique could improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff over existing SoTA CNN models. Our best model achieves 82.72% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 11.66ms latency without any special data augmentation. Note that the latency is estimated by cycle-accurate simulation. For a fair comparison with the related work, the latency of each compared network is also estimated with the same simulator.",They compared their network with state-of-the-art models in Table 6.

639,What is the contribution of this paper?,"Even though the proposed methodology can be applied to any type of NPU, the current implementation is made for an adder-tree type NPU, called MIDAP (Kanget al., 2019).It has a fully-pipelined micro-architecture that consists of separate hardware modules and memory modules for convolution, activation function, and various reduction operations. Since it enables us to make a fully static schedule of operations without resource contention in the data path, we can estimate the end-to-end latency of a CNN quite accurately analytically. Unexpected delay may incur from off-chip DRAM delay that is not fully hidden by double buffering. Figure 6 depicts our building block structure. This block starts and ends with 1×1 convolution, with N searchable superkernels in the middle. Each searchable superkernel is designed similarly to Eq. (3), while we may use different threshold values in each superkernel. The kernel sizes and expansion ratios are selected among predetermined values. If the j-th searchable superkernel chooses an expansion ratio e_{j}, the j-th kernel has e_{j} times more channels than the first 1×1 convolution. Compared with the original MixConv suggested in (Tan and Le, 2019b), the proposed building block supports more diverse combinations of kernel sizes and expansion ratios. It enhances the efficiency of search results on our target NPU (Table 5). We propose to modify the loss function to activate the latency-aware loss term only when the estimated latency is larger than the latency constraint as follows:(9)CE+\lambda_{1}\cdot log(1+\lambda_{2}\cdot ReLU((\sum L)-T))Although this is not a panacea, this modification significantly eases the search process, which will be discussed in section 5.2 with various experiments. Figure 11 depicts an example distribution of activation values produced by two different SE blocks for three different images. The authors of the original paper (Hu et al., 2018) conjectured that if such distribution from a SE block does not differ widely between image classes, the SE block is not important. Thus, after training, they obtained averaged activation values of a SE block over multiple images in the same class.They compared the distributions of the averaged values over different image classes. They observed that removing the SE blocks that have similar distributions over different image classes incurs only a marginal loss in accuracy. In this work, we propose a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology extending the Single-Path NAS technique (Stamoulis et al., 2019). We modify the supernet architecture by varying the number of blocks in stages and adding mixed depthwise convolution (Tan and Le, 2019b) to the search space.

The end-to-end latency depends on the NPU architecture, and the proposed NAS technique could find a larger network with shorter latency by adding the latency factor to the loss function directly. The main benefit comes from different block assignment to stages. One of the most closely related work is the recently proposed NAS technique tailored for Google’s Edge-TPU [9]. While MBConv is widely used for GPU-aware NAS techniques, they prefer to use a single full convolution by fusing expansion layer and DWConv layer in some parts of the network, observing that the Edge-TPU runs the fused full convolution faster even though the required number of MAC (multiply-accumulate) operations is much larger. It confirms that the number of MAC operations is not a proper measure of latency, and platform-specific performance estimation is required.","Other criteria, such as complexity of the network or the number of MAC operations, is not a proper measure of latency.

641,"How ""superkernel"" is different from supernet?
","Figure 6 depicts our building block structure. This block starts and ends with 1×1 convolution, with N searchable superkernels in the middle. Each searchable superkernel is designed similarly to Eq. (3), while we may use different threshold values in each superkernel. The kernel sizes and expansion ratios are selected among predetermined values. If the j-th searchable superkernel chooses an expansion ratio e_{j}, the j-th kernel has e_{j} times more channels than the first 1×1 convolution. Compared with the original MixConv suggested in (Tan and Le, 2019b), the proposed building block supports more diverse combinations of kernel sizes and expansion ratios. It enhances the efficiency of search results on our target NPU (Table 5). A superkernel has two parameters to search: expansion ratio and kernel size. To limit the search space, we choose the expansion ratio among 0, 2, 4, and 6, and the kernel size between 3 and 5 when MBConv or full convolution is used as the building block. In the case of the MixConv-based building block, we use N=3 superkenels whose expansion ratio is 0 or 2; The sum of the expansion ratio of three superkernels has the same range as the expansion ratio of a single MBConv block. To allow three superkernels to have different kernel sizes, we let one of three superkernels be able to have 7 as the kernel size. A NAS technique explores a predefined search space and estimates the performance for each candidate architecture to find an optimal one with the highest accuracy under a given latency constraint. Thus there are three factors that affect the performance of NAS, as shown in Figure 1: search space, search strategy, and performance estimation. The search space of a NAS technique is usually restricted by a supernet that defines the topology of the largest network to explore. Since the performance of a network depends on the hardware platform, the NAS technique needs to be customized to a given hardware platform. While numerous NAS techniques have been proposed with various search strategies recently, their assumed hardware platforms are mostly GPUs. In this paper, we present a customized NAS technique for an NPU, which produces a CNN architecture with a better accuracy-latency tradeoff than existing models.",A superkernel is a component for searching expansion ratio and kernel sizes.

642,Why did the authors choose MIDAP as the target NPU to experiment on?,"Even though the proposed methodology can be applied to any type of NPU, the current implementation is made for an adder-tree type NPU, called MIDAP (Kanget al., 2019).It has a fully-pipelined micro-architecture that consists of separate hardware modules and memory modules for convolution, activation function, and various reduction operations. Since it enables us to make a fully static schedule of operations without resource contention in the data path, we can estimate the end-to-end latency of a CNN quite accurately analytically. Unexpected delay may incur from off-chip DRAM delay that is not fully hidden by double buffering. Another good feature of MIDAP is that it efficiently supports the following operations that would lower the MAC (multiply-accumulate) utilization in other NPUs that have many MAC units: pooling, DWConv, and squeeze-and-excitation (SE). For DWConv operation, it does not use an adder tree but an alternative hardware logic that consists of a set of individual accumulators connected to the multiply units. For pooling and SE operations, reduction logic is included in the pipeline.Note that MIDAP has not been implemented as a real hardware chip yet but as a virtual prototype with a cycle-accurate simulator. Thanks to the cycle-accurate simulator that considers the DRAM access contention and parametrized DRAM access delay, we could build an accurate analytical model for end-to-end latency estimation, based on the profiling result with the simulator.","The end-to-end latency can be estimated quite accurately, and MIDAP can efficiently support which which lower the MAC utilization in other NPUs.","Sure!

644,How does the authors select SE blocks to remove?,"Figure 11 depicts an example distribution of activation values produced by two different SE blocks for three different images. The authors of the original paper (Hu et al., 2018) conjectured that if such distribution from a SE block does not differ widely between image classes, the SE block is not important. Thus, after training, they obtained averaged activation values of a SE block over multiple images in the same class.They compared the distributions of the averaged values over different image classes. They observed that removing the SE blocks that have similar distributions over different image classes incurs only a marginal loss in accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose to remove SE blocks selectively to minimize the additional computation cost caused by SE blocks.We obtain activation values from a SE block for each input image and measure how the distribution of activation values varies over different input images.For each channel c, we calculate the standard deviation \sigma_{c} of activation values over different images. If \sigma_{c} is small in most channels, the activation values from the SE block does not differ much over images. Conceptually, it implies that the SE block does not help to discriminate further which channel is more influential. From the engineering perspective, it means that channel-wise multiplication of a SE block is similar to constant multiplication, which can be handled by the following convolutional layer. We define a metric as the average of standard deviation values \sigma_{c} over all channels that represent the diverseness of the activation distribution over different images. If the metric value is small, we remove the SE block. For example, in Figure 11, our metric of the SE block on the left side has a value of 0.021, while the right side has a value of 0.118, more than 5x larger than the left side; The left side is a better candidate for SE block removal. When we remove SE blocks according to this metric, the accuracy is found to be similar, while the latency got shorter (Table 6). Finally, we selectively removed SE blocks from ours-XL+, resulting in ours-XL-rmSE+. We collected the activation values using randomly sampled 10K images from the training dataset and calculated the metric explained in Sec. 4.3.3.After removing SE blocks from ours-XL+ based on the metric, only about 60% of the blocks in the network have SE blocks. As a result, we could make the latency shorter, while the accuracy was slightly improved than ours-XL+. This model achieves 82.72% top-1 accuracy with only 11.66ms latency.It is much better than EfficientNet-EdgeTPU-L (Gupta and Akin, 2020) that achieves 80.62% FP32 top-1 accuracy with more than 20ms on EdgeTPU. Our architecture on MIDAP is about 2 times faster with 2.1% higher accuracy.","Removing SE blocks having similar distributions over different image classes are known to incur only a marginal loss in accuracy.

645,"How does authors verify that searching in a small supernet then scaling is good tactic to search a big network?
","There are two methods to find an architecture with a loose latency constraint. One is to use compound scaling that scales a small network with shorter latency, and the other is to search a network directly. To compare these two methods,we first scaled ours-M using the same scaling coefficients that we used to scale ours-M+ to ours-L+ and trained it. When conducting a direct search, we scaled the depth and width of the supernet and the input image size first and applied the proposed NAS technique for the scaled supernet. We used batch size 512 instead of 1024 during the architecture search due to the memory limitation of TPU. The comparison result is shown in Table 7 in terms of top-1 accuracy(%) and the latency on the target NPU(ms).Two results were similar while direct search needed 10 hours on TPUv3; It means that compound scaling is an effective method to find a large network fast.","Searching in a small supernet then scaling was better than directly searching in a big supernet; The accuracy was similar, but the direct search needed much higher search cost.",Limited,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.2993716482207285,4.542318555617767,0.0,0.0003447087211306,0.0523883625864982,0.5516813397407532,0.0523885563015937,,0.0005010864110386,0.0,0.8213553164886624,0.7664587479253474

648,Is the extended search strategy beneficial? Does the gain simply come from modified search space?,"While most NAS techniques are not compared with a random search method, the authors (Li and Talwalkar, 2019) reported that a random search method is highly competitive. So we conducted an experiment to compare the proposed NAS technique with two random search methods, exploring the same search space defined by the supernet structure of ours-M.First, we designed a simple random search method that has the similar time complexity of the proposed technique. In this method, we randomly generate 15 models having a similar latency with ours-M, from the same search space. Then we train each of them for 1 epoch with cosine learning rate decay. After evaluating each of them, we choose the architecture with the topmost top-1 accuracy and fully train it. In the second method, called random selection, we randomly generate 20 models having a similar latency with ours-M and train them fully and take the architecture with the highest top-1 accuracy. Since the random selection method performs search and training simultaneously, it is slower than the proposed technique by the number of randomly generated models. Comparison results are reported in Table 6. It is confirmed that both random selection and random search are quite competitive, but noticeably inferior to ours-M in terms of accuracy.In detail, the worst case of random selection showed 0.8% lower accuracy than ours-M. The best performance obtained from 20 randomly generated models is 79.19%, still lower than the accuracy of ours-M.Note that random search and random selection show similar performance that is no smaller than the other networks. It means that the search space defined by the supernet architecture has a more significant effect on the accuracy than the search method.",The randomly searched network on the same supernet could not outperform the proposed result with Single-Path NAS. Thus the search strategy was beneficial.,"The trade-off between fidelity and diversity varies smoothly with the Gradient Scale, with higher scales trading off recall (diversity) for higher precision and IS (fidelity)",0.1395348787236345,0.0,0.1395348787236345,1.62293446078038,18.954555843556086,15.584571046857128,0.0588235294117647,0.0103092783505154,0.1556266695261001,0.3199494520491599,0.2001264542341232,0.2435909658670425,0.007659796171179,0.0,0.7999974901083556,0.7558426258491264
649,"How the proposed loss function is different from that of original Single-Path NAS?
","The existing hardware-aware differentiable NAS methods mostly define some hyperparameters to balance between accuracy and latency, including SinglePath NAS, whose loss function is defined as Eq. (6). Since there is no information on the target latency in the loss function, in case there is a strict latency constraint, they have to pay additional search costs for the hyperparameters to let the final architecture have no larger latency than the constraint. In addition, this process needs to be repeated whenever the target latency is changed. In this work, we propose a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology extending the Single-Path NAS technique (Stamoulis et al., 2019). We modify the supernet architecture by varying the number of blocks in stages and adding mixed depthwise convolution (Tan and Le, 2019b) to the search space. By modifying the loss function to directly include the target latency estimated by a cycle-accurate simulator of the target NPU, we could find a better baseline architecture with a shorter latency than the latency constraint. Using a tight latency constraint, we can reduce the search space to find the baseline network fast. Afterward, we apply compound scaling to find a larger network than the baseline network, and add SE blocks and h-swish activation functions in the post-processing step.Through the proposed NAS methodology, we could obtain a network with 82.72% accuracy with 11.66ms latency on our target NPU, without special data augmentation in training. It dominates the existing network models on the target NPU. It confirms the importance of supernet architecture design for a given NPU and effectiveness of the three-step approach in the proposed NAS methodology: supernet design, SinglePath NAS with a tighter latency constraint, and compound scaling and post-processing. Although this is not a panacea, this modification significantly eases the search process, which will be discussed in section 5.2 with various experiments.","Previous method needs additional search cost for hyperparameter, since they have no information for target latency.

650,"Why authors choose to extend Single-Path NAS as the search strategy, instead of famous NAS methods such as MNASNet?","Among diverse techniques to decrease the search cost, Single-Path NAS (Stamoulis et al., 2019) was recently proposed to find a good architecture faster than the existing differentiable NAS techniques. This technique is extended to broaden the search space by including the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block in the search space (Stamoulis et al., 2020). Our work is grounded on the original Single-Path NAS technique. Differentiable NAS methods usually define architecture parameters to choose which convolution layer to use in the block, training each convolution layer independently. Single-Path NAS (Stamoulis et al., 2019) reduce the search cost by decreasing the number of trainable parameters by sharing the kernel weights between convolution layers.The key idea is designing an over-parameterized depthwise convolution kernel named superkernel, and letting each depthwise convolution kernel of candidate MBConvs directly inherit the weights of this superkernel. We finish this subsection by highlighting the merit of Single-Path NAS on building a MixConv-based differentiable NAS. Conventional multi-path NAS methods would have difficulties when adding inverted bottleneck convolution with MixConv to their search space. Since the number of possible choices of such blocks grows proportionally to the partition number, multi-path NAS methods would introduce a significant increase in memory requirements and the search time. On the contrary, MixConv can be efficiently supported in Single-Path NAS, as explained below. Since an NPU is much faster than a GPU, it enables us to explore the wider search space for NAS under a given latency constraint. Since there are many factors to define the search space, such as the number of layers, channels, kernel sizes, and so on, the search space grows exponentially as the allowed computation complexity grows. Hence, reducing the search space, as well as the search time, is very challenging for NPU-aware NAS techniques. While the aforementioned work for Google’s Edge TPU trains each architecture candidate from scratch to estimate the performance, it is not computationally efficient. In contrast, we adopt a fast differentiable hardware-aware One-Shot NAS, called Single-Path NAS (Stamoulis et al., 2019), in order to reduce the search time. In this work, we propose a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology extending the Single-Path NAS technique (Stamoulis et al., 2019). We modify the supernet architecture by varying the number of blocks in stages and adding mixed depthwise convolution (Tan and Le, 2019b) to the search space.

651,How does equation 2 let the supernet search kernel size?,"Let \mathbf{w}_{k,e} denote the depthwise convolution kernel of candidate MBConv with kernel size k and expansion ratio e (MBConv{}_{k,e}). First, they introduce a large \mathbf{w}_{5,6}, which is the DWConv kernel of MBConv{}_{5,6}. Then, the inner core of \mathbf{w}_{5,6} can be considered as \mathbf{w}_{3,6}, a DWConv kernel of MBConv{}_{3,6}.A superkernel containing these two kernel size options can be expressed as Figure 4:(1)\mathbf{w}_{*,6}=\mathbf{w}_{3,6}+\mathbbm{1}(\rm{use\leavevmode\nobreak\ kernel\leavevmode\nobreak\ size\leavevmode\nobreak\ 5})\cdot\mathbf{w}_{5\backslash 3,6}where \mathbf{w}_{5\backslash 3,e} means the outer part, \mathbf{w}_{5,e}-\mathbf{w}_{3,e}.Next, they formulate conditions to determine the kernel size. They define a certain threshold value t and compare the norm of the kernel weights with the threshold. If the norm of a subset weight is larger than the threshold, it remains in the supernet. To this end, Eq. (1) is changed as follows:(2)\mathbf{w}_{*,6}(t_{k=5})=\mathbf{w}_{3,6}+\mathbbm{1}(\lVert\mathbf{w}_{5\backslash 3,6}\rVert^{2}>t_{k=5})\cdot\mathbf{w}_{5\backslash 3,6} The threshold value is also trainable to be automatically chosen during training. To enable back-propagation, they relax 1(x > t) to σ(x − t) when computing gradients. In addition, they optimize kernel weights and threshold values simultaneously. For a given tight search time, this method is shown to be more effective than the other methods [29].","They define a trainable threshold value t, and compare the norm of the kernel weights with the threshold, to determine the kernel size.","Running information on resource-constrained environments is important because many mobile and embedded devices, despite the increasing prevalence of GPUs, still have limited computing resources, making it challenging to deploy state-of-the-art neural networks",0.1568627404229144,0.0,0.1568627404229144,1.5993628545166856,14.434693161175533,13.11730696724126,0.1115241635687732,0.0112994350282485,0.1446142643690109,0.371045575918019,0.1446142047643661,0.2639298439025879,0.0185930624404353,0.6666666666666666,0.7289423419090362,0.7589189466972103

In the proposed supernet, a block is defined as MBConv that typically starts with 1×1 conv (expansion layer) and ends with 1×1 conv. Adopting the MixConv approach, the depthwise convolution layer consists of parallel superkernels whose kernel size will be determined during the NAS process. The width of block denotes the number of channels in the final output feature map of the block, and the width of stage is the width of the final block in the stage. We will call the total number of blocks starting from the very first block in the network up to the last block in a specific stage S, as the cumulative depth up to stage S.",The total number of blocks starting from the very first bloci in the network up to the last block in a specific stage.,"Instance segmentation is a computer vision task that involves correctly detecting and precisely segmenting each individual object instance in an image, combining elements of object detection and semantic segmentation",0.130434777693762,0.0,0.0434782559546319,1.6125620554954614,12.21535097137456,10.488092231885188,0.0609756097560975,0.0102509720749381,0.1357251554727554,0.3730545305418518,0.1357250362634658,0.3568788468837738,0.0045607363563877,0.5,0.762511828074301,0.712666807768857
653,How does the authors verify adding h-swish and SE is beneficial?,"Extensive studies have been conducted to find a better activation function than ReLU, and the swish activation function (Ramachandranet al., 2017) was found. Several neural networks (Tan and Le, 2019b; Mei et al., 2019; Tan and Le, 2019a) use swish activation function instead of ReLU to improve accuracy. Howard et al. (Howard et al., 2019) proposed a quantization-friendly version of the swish activation function called h-swish that has a similar impact on accuracy. So, we replace ReLU with h-swish (Howard et al., 2019) activation function. We improve the baseline network by adding the h-swish activation function and squeeze-and-excitation(SE) block to get the ours-M+ model. Figure 12 shows the topology of ours-M+ architecture in which the height of each block is proportional to the expansion ratio of the block. Compared with the baseline network, ours-M, we achieve around 1% accuracy boost with ours-M+, paying the cost of 16% latency increase. This model outperforms the other models, 0.5% higher accuracy and 14% faster than EfficientNet-B2. Since EfficientNet-B2 is too large to run with the default configuration on MIDAP, we increase the memory size for filter weights.  To examine how SE and h-swish impact accuracy individually, we compare four combinations as displayed in Table 8. The baseline is ours-M that does not use SE and h-swish activation function. Replacing ReLU with h-swish gives a marginal improvement on accuracy while adding SE blocks improves the accuracy noticeably. Adding both SE and h-swish activation function improves the accuracy by around 1%. For accurate latency estimation, an analytical latency estimator is devised, based on a cycle-level NPU simulator that runs an entire CNN considering the memory access overhead accurately.Since the NPU assumed in this paper can execute depth-wise separable convolution (DWConv), squeeze-and-excitation (SE), and h-swish activation function efficiently, the proposed supernet prefers DWConv to regular convolution. Observing that the accuracy is improved by around 1% if SE and h-swish activation function are used, we add a post-processing phase after a CNN network is found by NAS to add SE layers and to replace ReLU to h-swish activation function.","Previous works showed that using swish activation function instead of ReLU showed better accuracy, and h-swish shows similar impact on accuracy. The authors verify that replacing ReLU with h-swish and adding SE improves the accuracy by around 1%.","The author can claim that only using absolute positional encoding with the Transformer can exhibit a too relaxed structural inductive bias because distance or Laplacian-based positional representations do not provide a measure of structural similarity between nodes, especially in the inductive case where two nodes are from different graphs",0.1599999951075557,0.0,0.1599999951075557,1.1741330736581586,22.40156362886314,18.620729468637155,0.116822429906542,0.0105399010539901,0.1540653705596923,0.4325450896113008,0.1969094276428222,0.2322538793087005,0.0034023219387383,,0.758100166289192,0.7691656879960538
654,What happens if author removes the linear supernet design and opt to use the covnentional supernet design?,"As shown in Table 4, a supernet with linear depth outperforms a supernet with constant depth in terms of accuracy with similar latency. It confirms that this simple change of block assignment in supernet gives notable accuracy boost with the same latency constraint, without any additional optimization techniques. The number of blocks is one of the key parameters in this structure. Some recent studies [23, 24] report that the way of assigning the number of blocks in each stage has a noticeable impact on the accuracy, even with the same number of blocks in total. However, in conventional One-Shot NAS methods, each stage in the supernet has the same number of blocks [8, 17, 18, 22].","Using the conventional, constant depth method would drop the accuracy.","fANOVA is performed by marginalizing over dimensions efficiently in regression trees, allowing for predicting the marginal error for one hyperparameter while averaging over all the others, without requiring a full hyperparameter grid search",0.0526315753324102,0.0,0.0526315753324102,0.6555917096834903,9.744339366791472,8.543656955945057,0.1048951048951049,0.0105330354293009,0.1677807867527008,0.536392591688611,0.1677807718515396,0.5494682788848877,0.0028399783911107,0.0,0.739490811037475,0.7530689435665812

667,"What exactly is ""smoothing"" and how does it help count-based LMs account for unseen sequences?","Language Modeling (LM) has been a central task in NLP. The goal of LM is to learn a probability distribution over sequences of symbols pertaining to a language. Much work has been done on both parametric (e.g., log-linear models) and non-parametric approaches (e.g., count-based LMs). Count-based approaches (based on statistics of N-grams) typically add smoothing which account for unseen (yet possible) sequences, and have been quite successful. To this extent, Kneser-Ney smoothed 5-gram models (Kneser & Ney, 1995) are a fairly strong baseline which, for large amounts of training data, have challenged other parametric approaches based on Neural Networks (Bengio et al., 2006).",The paper does not discuss what smoothing is or how it helps some LMs account for unseen sequences.,"The authors mean that the RoI layer was added in a way that deviates from the natural progression of the network's architecture, specifically by inserting it between two sets of convolutional layers",0.0869565169754256,0.0,0.0869565169754256,1.152278059434571,13.596692452029426,11.027309399263034,0.048780487804878,0.0102171136653895,0.1622833907604217,0.4557625760837478,0.1622833907604217,0.4011726081371307,0.0128237999294316,,0.7318999918550472,0.7609541581434134
668,"What is a ""recurrent state space""?","A crucial aspect which we discuss in detail in later sections is the size of our models. Despite the large number of parameters, we try to minimize computation as much as possible by adopting a strategy proposed in (Sak et al., 2014) of projecting a relatively big recurrent state space down so that the matrices involved remain relatively small, yet the model has large memory capacity. Unsurprisingly, size matters: when training on a very large and complex data set, fitting the training data with an LSTM is fairly challenging. Thus, the size of the LSTM layer is a very important factor that influences the results, as seen in Table 1. The best models are the largest we were able to fit into a GPU memory. Our largest model was a 2-layer LSTM with 8192+1024 dimensional recurrent state in each of the layers. Increasing the embedding and projection size also helps but causes a large increase in the number of parameters, which is less desirable. Lastly, training an RNN instead of an LSTM yields poorer results (about 5 perplexity worse) for a comparable model size.",Paper does not discuss what a recurrent state space is.,To optimize the domain classification of both real and fake images separately,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.965087168175613,9.72381537613171,0.0,0.0099009900990099,-0.0298966951668262,0.4236893840134144,-0.0298968870192766,0.4796534776687622,0.0010597074073879,0.0,0.708218335623382,0.7070998542899762

The resulting features are fed to a 2-layer highway network (Srivastava et al., 2015b), which allows the embedding to learn semantic representations.

670,What is a 128-dim correction?,"z_{w}=h^{T}CNN(chars_{w})+h^{T}Mcorr_{w}where M is a matrix projecting a low-dimensional embedding vector corr_{w} back up to the dimensionality of the projected LSTM hidden state of h. This amounts to adding a bottleneck linear layer, and brings the CNN Softmax much closer to our best result, as can be seen in Table 1, where adding a 128-dim correction halves the gap between regular and the CNN Softmax. As described in Section 3.2, adding a “correction” word embedding term alleviates the gap between regular and CNN Softmax. Indeed, we can trade-off model size versus perplexity. For instance, by adding 100M weights (through a 128 dimensional bottleneck embedding) we achieve 35.8 perplexity (see Table 1).",It is a means of improvement over words that have different meaning but are spelled similarly.,"By aligning the bottom decoder layer to the top encoder layer, parallelism in the decoder network can be removed, and the model would not benefit from using more than one GPU for decoding",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.236926662893934,10.67769499717045,0.0,0.0099009900990099,0.0360550656914711,0.3787702238969219,0.0360550060868263,0.2020334750413894,0.0056533010279249,,0.7589177490346039,0.7072262211384523
671,What is dropout and how does it alleviate overfitting?,"Following (Zaremba et al., 2014) we use dropout (Srivastava, 2013) before and after every LSTM layer. The biases of LSTM forget gate were initialized to 1.0 (Jozefowicz et al., 2015). The size of the models will be described in more detail in the following sections, and the choices of hyper-parameters will be released as open source upon publication. As shown in Table 1, using dropout improves the results. To our surprise, even relatively small models (e.g., single layer LSTM with 2048 units projected to 512 dimensional outputs) can over-fit the training set if trained long enough, eventually yielding holdout set degradation. Using dropout on non-recurrent connections largely mitigates these issues. While over-fitting still occurs, there is no more need for early stopping. For models that had 4096 or less units in the LSTM layer, we used 10% dropout probability. For larger models, 25% was significantly better. Even with such regularization, perplexities on the training set can be as much as 6 points below test.",Dropout is a neural network component parametrized with a probability.

Note that the only difference between NCE and IS is that, in NCE, we define a binary classification task between true or noise words with a logistic loss, whereas in IS we define a multiclass classification problem with a Softmax and cross entropy loss. We hope that our derivation helps clarify the similarities and differences between the two. In particular, we observe that IS, as it optimizes a multiclass classification task (in contrast to solving a binary task), may be a better choice. Indeed, the updates to the logits with IS are tied whereas in NCE they are independent. Table 3 shows the test perplexities of NCE vs IS loss after a few epochs of 2048 unit LSTM with 512 projection.

673,Why doesn't character-level embeddings degrade performance compared to word-level embeddings? ,"The character-level features allow for a smoother and compact parametrization of the word embeddings. Recent efforts on small scale language modeling have used CNN character embeddings for the input embeddings (Kim et al., 2015). Although not as straightforward, we propose an extension to this idea to also reduce the number of parameters of the Softmax layer. Recall from Section 2.3 that the Softmax computes a logit as z_{w}=h^{T}e_{w} where h is a context vector and e_{w} the word embedding. Instead of building a matrix of |V|\times|h| (whose rows correspond to e_{w}), we produce e_{w} with a CNN over the characters of w as e_{w}=CNN(chars_{w}) – we call this a CNN Softmax. We used the same network architecture to dynamically generate the Softmax word embeddings without sharing the parameters with the input word-embedding sub-network. For inference, the vectors e_{w} can be precomputed, so there is no computational complexity increase w.r.t. the regular Softmax.",The paper discusses one advantage of character-level embeddings over word-level embeddings. There is no comprehensive discussion on why the resulting performance does not degrade.,"The value of 0.5 is set as the watermark probability threshold for filtering out NSFW images and toxic words in the text.

674,How does maximizing log-likelihood lead to optimizing cross-entropy between target probability distribution and the model prediction?,"Assigning probability distributions over large vocabularies is computationally challenging. For modeling language, maximizing log-likelihood of a given word sequence leads to optimizing cross-entropy between the target probability distribution (e.g., the target word we should be predicting), and our model predictions p. Generally, predictions come from a linear layer followed by a Softmax non-linearity: p(w)=\frac{\exp(z_{w})}{\sum_{w^{\prime}\in V}\exp(z_{w^{\prime}})} where z_{w} is the logit corresponding to a word w.

The model cannot choose the embedding function to be zero to overcome the small distance issue during triplet selection, as the embedding function is learned during training and is not a parameter that can be set to zero.

681,Can improvement of NER technology improves RE technology?,"In this work, we discuss two obstacles that have hindered the performance of existing RE models.First, the RE task provides a structured input of both the raw texts and side information of the entities, such as entity names, spans, and types (typically provided by NER models), which are shown important to the performance of RE models Peng et al. (2020).However, existing methods fall short of representing the entity information comprehensively in the text, leading to limited characterization of the entities.Second, human-labeled RE datasets (e.g., TACRED), may contain a large portion of noisy or ill-defined labels, causing the model performance to be misestimated.Alt et al. (2020) relabeled the development and test set of TACRED and found that 6.62\% of labels are incorrect.Stoica et al. (2021) refined many ill-defined relation types and further re-annotated the TACRED dataset using an improved annotation strategy to ensure high-quality labels.To this end, we propose an improved RE baseline, where we introduce the typed entity marker to sentence-level RE, which leads to promising improvement of performance over existing RE models.","Entity names, spans and types are important to the performance of RE models Peng et al.

683,Author said that they achieved to make SOTA RE models. Give an evidences for this statement.,"We first provide an analysis on different entity representation techniques. In this analysis, we use the base and large versions of BERT Devlin et al. (2019) and the large version of RoBERTa Liu et al. (2019) as the encoder.Table 1 shows the performance of the PLMs incorporated with different entity representation techniques.For each technique, we also provide an example of the processed text.We have several observations from the results.First, the typed entity marker and its variants outperform untyped entity representation techniques by a notable margin.Especially, the RoBERTa model achieves an F_{1} score of 74.6\% using the typed entity marker (punct), which is significantly higher than the SOTA result of 72.7\% by LUKE Yamada et al. (2020).This shows that representing all categories of entity information is helpful to the RE task.It also shows that keeping entity names in the input improves the performance of RE models.Second, symbols used in entity markers have an obvious impact on the performance of RE models.Although the original and punct versions of entity representation techniques represent the same categories of entity information, they do lead to a difference in model performance.Particularly, introducing new special tokens hinders the model performance drastically on RoBERTa.On RoBERTa{}_{\text{LARGE}}, the entity marker underperforms the entity marker (punct) by 0.7\%, the typed entity marker underperforms the typed entity marker (punct) by 3.6\%, while the entity mask gets a much worse result of 60.9\%. In this paper, we present a simple yet strong RE baseline that offers new SOTA performance, along with a comprehensive study to understand its prediction generalizability and robustness.Specifically, we revisit two technical problems in sentence-level RE, namely entity representation and noisy or ill-defined labels.We propose an improved entity representation technique, which significantly outperforms existing sentence-level RE models.Especially, our improved RE baseline achieves an F_{1} score of 91.1\% on the Re-TACRED dataset, showing that PLMs already achieve satisfactory performance on this task.We hope the proposed techniques and analyses can benefit future research on RE. We evaluate our model on TACRED Zhang et al. (2017), TACREV Alt et al. (2020), and Re-TACRED Stoica et al. (2021).Using RoBERTa Liu et al. (2019) as the backbone, our improved baseline model achieves an F_{1} of 74.6\% and 83.2\% on TACRED and TACREV, respectively, significantly outperforming various SOTA RE models.Particularly, our baseline model achieves an F_{1} of 91.1\% on Re-TACRED, demonstrating that PLMs can achieve much better results on RE than shown in previous work.222This work first appeared as a technical report on arXiv in Feb 2021 Zhou and Chen (2021).Since then, the proposed techniques have been incorporated into several follow-up works Chen et al.

684,Entity marker and entity mask are same terms. Is this true?,"•Entity mask Zhang et al. (2017). This technique introduces new special tokens [SUBJ-TYPE] or [OBJ-TYPE] to mask the subject or object entities in the original text, where TYPE is substituted with the respective entity type.This technique was originally proposed in the PA-LSTM model Zhang et al. (2017), and was later adopted by PLMs such as SpanBERT Joshi et al. (2020).Zhang et al. (2017) claim that this technique prevents the RE model from over-fitting specific entity names, leading to more generalizable inference.•Entity marker Zhang et al. (2019); Baldini Soares et al. (2019). This technique introduces special tokens pairs [E1], [/E1] and [E2], [/E2] to enclose the subject and object entities, therefore modifying the input text to the format of “[E1] subj [/E1] … [E2] obj [/E2]”333subj and obj are respectively the original token spans of subject and object entities..•Entity marker (punct) Wang et al. (2020); Zhou et al. (2021). This technique is a variant of the previous technique that encloses entity spans using punctuation.It modifies the input text to “@ subj @ … # obj #”. The main difference from the previous technique is that this one does not introduce new special tokens into the model’s reserved vocabulary.•Typed entity marker Zhong and Chen (2021). This technique further incorporates the NER types into entity markers.It introduces new special tokens \langleS:TYPE\rangle, \langle/S:TYPE\rangle, \langleO:TYPE\rangle, \langle/O:TYPE\rangle, where TYPE is the corresponding NER type given by a named entity tagger. The input text is accordingly modified to “\langleS:TYPE\rangle subj \langle/S:TYPE\rangle … \langleO:TYPE\rangle obj \langle/O:TYPE\rangle”.•Typed entity marker (punct). We propose a variant of the typed entity marker technique that marks the entity span and entity types without introducing new special tokens.This is to enclose the subject and object entities with “@” and “#”, respectively.We also represent the subject and object entity types using their label text, which is prepended to the entity spans and is enclosed by “*” for subjects or “\wedge” for objects.The modified text is “@ * subj-type * subj @ … # \wedge obj-type \wedge obj # ”, where subj-type and obj-type is the label text of NER types.","It's not true.

685,BLINK is Scalable. Is this true?,"Scale is a key challenge for entity linking; there are millions of possible entities to consider for each mention. To efficiently filter or rank the candidates, existing methods use different sources of external information, including manually curated mention tables Ganea and Hofmann (2017), incoming Wikipedia link popularity Yamada et al. (2016), and gold Wikipedia entity categories Gillick et al. (2019). In this paper, we show that BERT-based models set new state-of-the-art performance levels for large scale entity linking when used in a zero shot setup, where there is no external knowledge and a short text description provides the only information we have for each entity. We also present an extensive evaluation of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent to large pre-trained models, and show is possible to achieve very efficient linking with modest loss of accuracy. More specifically, we introduce a two stage approach for zero-shot linking (see Figure 1 for an overview), based on fine-tuned BERT architectures Devlin et al. (2019). In the first stage, we do retrieval in a dense space defined by a bi-encoder that independently embeds the mention context and the entity descriptions Humeau et al. (2019); Gillick et al. (2019).Each retrieved candidate is then examined more carefully with a cross-encoder that concatenates the mention and entity text, following Logeswaran et al. (2019). This overall approach is conceptually simple but highly effective, as we show through detailed experiments. We proposed a conceptually simple, scalable, and highly effective two stage approach for entity linking. We show that our BERT-based model outperforms IR methods for entity retrieval, and achieved new state-of-the-art results on recently introduced zero-shot entity linking dataset, WikilinksNED Unseen-Mentions dataset, and the more established TACKBP-2010 benchmark, without any task-specific heuristics or external entity knowledge. We present evaluations of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent to large pre-trained models, and show that it is possible to achieve efficient linking with modest loss of accuracy.Finally, we show that knowledge distillation can further improve bi-encoder model performance.Future work includes:•Enriching entity representations by adding entity type and entity graph information;•Modeling coherence by jointly resolving mentions in a document;•Extending our work to other languages and other domains;•Joint models for mention detection and entity linking.","The paper shows the scalability of the proposed simple two-stage method with the experiments conducted on the zero-shot entity-linking dataset where external entity knowledge is not available, which enables the model to be used on various entity linking tasks that contain millions of possible entities to consider.

686,"BLINK have two different versions, bi-encoding version and cross-encoding version. Is this true?","As expected, the cross-encoder performs better than the bi-encoder on ranking. However, both models exceed state-of-the-art performance levels, demonstrating that the overall approach is highly effective. We observe that our model also performs well when we change the underlying Knowledgebase to full Wikipedia, and even without fine-tuning on the dataset. In Table 5 we show that our bi-encoder model is highly effective at retrieving relevant entities, where the underlying Knowledgebase is full Wikipedia. In the first example, we see that the bi-encoder mistakenly links “Ronaldo” to the Brazilian football player, while the cross-encoder is able to use context word “Juventus” to disambiguate. In the second example, the cross-encoder is able to identify from context that the sentence is describing art instead of fiction, where the bi-encoder failed. In the third example, the bi-encoder is able to find the correct entity “Ancient Greek,”; where the cross-encoder mistakenly links it to the entity “Ancient Greek philosophy,” likely because that the word “philosophers” is in context. We observe that cross-encoder is often better at utilizing context information than bi-encoder, but can sometimes make mistakes because of misleading context cues. Figure 1 shows our overall approach. The bi-encoder uses two independent BERT transformers to encode model context/mention and entity into dense vectors, and each entity candidate is scored as the dot product of these vectors. The candidates retrieved by the bi-encoder are then passed to the cross-encoder for ranking. The cross-encoder encodes context/mention and entity in one transformer, and applies an additional linear layer to compute the final score for each pair. After training our model on Wikipedia, we fine-tune the model on the TACKBP-2010 training dataset. We use the top 100 candidates retrieved by the bi-encoder as training examples for the cross-encoder, and chose hyper-parameters based on cross validation. We report accuracy results in Table 4. For ablation studies, we also report the following versions of our model:","BLINK model is a two-stage method using two encoders: bi-encoder and cross-encoder.

Finally, we do an extensive evaluation of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent in our bi- and cross-encoder models.We show that the two stage methods scales well in a full Wikipedia setting, by linking against all the 5.9M Wikipedia entities for TACKBP-2010, while still outperforming existing model with much smaller candidate sets.We also show that bi-encoder linking is very fast with approximate nearest neighbor search (e.g. linking over 5.9 million candidates in 2 milliseconds), and that much of the accuracy gain from the more expensive cross-encoder can be transferred to the bi-encoder via knowledge distillation.We release our code and models, as well as a system to link entity mentions to all of Wikipedia (similar to TagME Ferragina and Scaiella (2011)).111Our code and models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/BLINK","Since the cross-encoder has large memory consumption and compute footprint, it is time-consuming and not suitable for tasks that require fast inference.

All the entities are from the TAC Reference Knowledgebase which contains 818,741 entities with titles, descriptions and other meta info. After training our model on Wikipedia, we fine-tune the model on the TACKBP-2010 training dataset. We use the top 100 candidates retrieved by the bi-encoder as training examples for the cross-encoder, and chose hyper-parameters based on cross validation. We report accuracy results in Table 4.

There are however many other cues that could potentially be added in future work. For example, Khalife and Vazirgiannis (2018) report 94.57\% precision on the TACKBP-2010 dataset. However, their method is based on the strong assumption that a gold fine-grained entity type is given for each mention (and they do not attempt to do entity type prediction). Indeed, if fine-grained entity type information is given by an oracle at test time, then Raiman and Raiman (2018) reports 98.6\% accuracy on TACKBP-2010, indicating that improving fine-grained entity type prediction would likely improve entity linking.

698,What is maximum spanning tree problem?,"To solve EL in the general case, evenwhen the first mention does not have the correct entity, we propose bidirectional connections between mentions, thus leading to a maximum spanning tree problem in our Global approach.Here we define a score for a (sub)tree t, noted as \Phi_{\mathrm{tr}}(t):\Phi_{\mathrm{tr}}(t)=\sum_{(i,j)\in t}\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}(u_{i},u_{j}),(7)where u_{i} and u_{j} are two connected nodes (i.e., root, candidate entities or spans) in t.For a ground truth cluster c\in C (with C being the set of all such clusters), with its set444For a single cluster annotation, indeed it is possible that multiple correct trees can be drawn. of correct subtree representations \mathcal{T}_{c}, we model the cluster’s likelihood with its subtree scores. We minimize the negative log-likelihood \mathcal{L} of all clusters:\displaystyle\mathcal{L}\displaystyle=-\log\frac{\prod_{c\in C}\sum_{t\in\mathcal{T}_{c}}\exp\big{(}\Phi_{\mathrm{tr}}(t)\big{)}}{\sum_{t\in\mathcal{T}_{\textit{all}}}\exp\big{(}\Phi_{\mathrm{tr}}(t)\big{)}}.(8)Naively enumerating all possible spanning trees (\mathcal{T}_{\textit{all}} or \mathcal{T}_{c}) implied by this equation is infeasible, since their number is exponentially large.We use the adapted Kirchhoff’s Matrix Tree Theorem(MTT; Koo et al. (2007); Tutte (1984))to solve this:the sum of the weights of the spanning trees in a directed graph rooted in r is equal to the determinant of the Laplacian matrix of the graph with the row and column corresponding to r removed (i.e., the minor of the Laplacian with respect to r). This way, eq. (8) can be rewritten as\displaystyle\mathcal{L}\displaystyle=-\log\frac{\prod_{c\in C}{\det\Big{(}\mathbf{\hat{L}}_{c}\big{(}\mathbf{\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}}\big{)}\Big{)}}}{\det\Big{(}\mathbf{L}_{r}\big{(}\mathbf{\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}}\big{)}\Big{)}},(9)where \mathbf{\Phi_{\mathrm{cl}}} is the weighted adjacency matrix of the graph, and \mathbf{L}_{r} is the minor of the Laplacian with respect to the root node r.

699,What is the difference between the local model and the global model?,"Our first approach (Local in Fig. 1(a)) is motivated by current state-of-the-artcoreference resolution models(Joshi et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020)that predict a single antecedent for each span to resolve.We extend this architecture by also considering entity links as potential antecendents:in the example of Fig. 1, the mention “Alliance” can be either connected to its antecedent mention “NATO” or to any of its candidate links (Alliance or Alliance,_Ohio).While straightforward,this approach cannot solvecases where the first coreferenced mention does not include the correct entity in its candidate list(e.g., if the order of “NATO” and “Alliance” mentions in Fig. 1 would be reversed).We therefor propose a second approach, Global, which by construction overcomes this inherent limitation by using bidirectional connections between mentions.Because that implies cycles could be formed, we resort to solving a maximum spanning tree problem.Mentions that refer to the same entity form a cluster, represented as a subtree rooted by the single entity they link to.To encode the overall document’s clusters in a single spanning tree, we introduce a virtual root node(see Fig. 1(b)).222Coreference clusters without a linked entity, i.e., a NIL cluster, have a link of a mention directly to the root. We propose twomethods for joint coreference and EL.The first, Local, is motivated by end-to-end span-based coreference resolution models(Lee et al., 2017, 2018)that optimize the marginalized probability of the correct antecedents for each given span.We extend this local marginalization to include the span’s candidate entity links.

725,What is instance segmentation ?,"Instance segmentation is challenging because it requires the correct detection of all objects in an image while also precisely segmenting each instance. It therefore combines elements from the classical computer vision tasks of object detection, where the goal is to classify individual objects and localize each using a bounding box, and semantic segmentation, where the goal is to classify each pixel into a fixed set of categories without differentiating object instances.111Following common terminology, we use object detection to denote detection via bounding boxes, not masks, and semantic segmentation to denote per-pixel classification without differentiating instances. Yet we note that instance segmentation is both semantic and a form of detection. Given this, one might expect a complex method is required to achieve good results. However, we show that a surprisingly simple, flexible, and fast system can surpass prior state-of-the-art instance segmentation results.","Instance segmentation is a new type of computer vision task that aims to solve the problem of how to represent all objects in an image. It combines elements from the classical computer vision tasks of object detection and localizing each object using a bounding box, and semantic segmentation.","An online experiment is conducted on a live system, where the results are observed in real-time, while an offline experiment is conducted on a static dataset, where the results are observed after the experiment is completed",0.1639344215318464,0.0,0.1639344215318464,1.20152587768224,23.53106088959698,20.06375532202628,0.0803212851405622,0.0079365079365079,0.0385758280754089,0.4636565452778041,0.0528829842805862,0.3447508811950683,0.0270629776620101,,0.7299037419791189,0.7326315061453613

728,What are the hyperparameters used for inference ?,"At test time, the proposal number is 300 for the C4 backbone (as in [36]) and 1000 for FPN (as in [27]). We run the box prediction branch on these proposals, followed by non-maximum suppression [14]. The mask branch is then applied to the highest scoring 100 detection boxes. Although this differs from the parallel computation used in training, it speeds up inference and improves accuracy (due to the use of fewer, more accurate RoIs). The mask branch can predict K masks per RoI, but we only use the k-th mask, where k is the predicted class by the classification branch. The m\timesm floating-number mask output is then resized to the RoI size, and binarized at a threshold of 0.5. Models are trained on all COCO trainval35k images that contain annotated keypoints. To reduce overfitting, as this training set is smaller, we train using image scales randomly sampled from [640, 800] pixels; inference is on a single scale of 800 pixels. We train for 90k iterations, starting from a learning rate of 0.02 and reducing it by 10 at 60k and 80k iterations. We use bounding-box NMS with a threshold of 0.5.

729,Does adding the third branch result in better results for the Mask R-CNN over the faster R-CNN ?,"Mask R-CNN is conceptually simple: Faster R-CNN has two outputs for each candidate object, a class label and a bounding-box offset; to this we add a third branch that outputs the object mask. Mask R-CNN is thus a natural and intuitive idea. But the additional mask output is distinct from the class and box outputs, requiring extraction of much finer spatial layout of an object. Next, we introduce the key elements of Mask R-CNN, including pixel-to-pixel alignment, which is the main missing piece of Fast/Faster R-CNN. More importantly, we have a unified model that can simultaneously predict boxes, segments, and keypoints while running at 5 fps. Adding a segment branch (for the person category) improves the AP{}^{\text{kp}} to 63.1 (Table 4) on test-dev. More ablations of multi-task learning on minival are in Table 5. Adding the mask branch to the box-only (i.e., Faster R-CNN) or keypoint-only versions consistently improves these tasks. However, adding the keypoint branch reduces the box/mask AP slightly, suggesting that while keypoint detection benefits from multitask training, it does not in turn help the other tasks. Nevertheless, learning all three tasks jointly enables a unified system to efficiently predict all outputs simultaneously (Figure 7).",Yes it does.,"Superkernel and supernet are different in their purpose and composition.

This is most evident in how RoIPool [18, 12], the de facto core operation for attending to instances, performs coarse spatial quantization for feature extraction. To fix the misalignment, we propose a simple, quantization-free layer, called RoIAlign, that faithfully preserves exact spatial locations. Despite being a seemingly minor change, RoIAlign has a large impact: it improves mask accuracy by relative 10% to 50%, showing bigger gains under stricter localization metrics. Second, we found it essential to decouple mask and class prediction: we predict a binary mask for each class independently, without competition among classes, and rely on the network’s RoI classification branch to predict the category. In contrast, FCNs usually perform per-pixel multi-class categorization, which couples segmentation and classification, and based on our experiments works poorly for instance segmentation.","The reason is that Faster R-CNN. has two outputs for each candidate object, a class label, and a bounding-box offset; to this, we add a third branch that outputs the object mask. But the additional mask output is distinct from the class and box outputs, requiring extraction of a much finer spatial layout of an object. This model performs better than the model presented due to RoIAlign but is 0.9 points box AP lower than Mask R- CNN.","The approaches that led to improved accuracy with lesser parameters for NASNets compared to Inception, ResNet, and PolyNet are:

732,Why it is sufficient to predict a binary mask without concern for the categories once the instance has been classified as a whole ?,"Mask R-CNN decouples mask and class prediction: as the existing box branch predicts the class label, we generate a mask for each class without competition among classes (by a per-pixel sigmoid and a binary loss). In Table 2b, we compare this to using a per-pixel softmax and a multinomial loss (as commonly used in FCN [30]). This alternative couples the tasks of mask and class prediction, and results in a severe loss in mask AP (5.5 points). This suggests that once the instance has been classified as a whole (by the box branch), it is sufficient to predict a binary mask without concern for the categories, which makes the model easier to train.","it is sufficient to predict a binary mask without concern for the categories once the instance has been classified as a whole because Mask R-CNN decouples mask and class prediction: as the existing box branch predicts the class label,a mask is generated  for each class without competition among classes (by a per-pixel sigmoid and a binary loss)",No. The paper also discusses the challenges of creating the large-scale object recognition benchmark dataset and highlights developments in object classification and detection that have resulted from this effort,0.0597014877879264,0.0,0.0597014877879264,0.8265874510641286,28.845580070558235,23.03779858336249,0.042517006802721,0.0053416835512985,0.3826401233673095,0.4246150541826187,0.3670728504657745,0.4176183938980102,0.0059705577166556,,0.7674081622690839,0.7789793832057662

Mask R-CNN is thus a natural and intuitive idea. But the additional mask output is distinct from the class and box outputs, requiring extraction of much finer spatial layout of an object. Next, we introduce the key elements of Mask R-CNN, including pixel-to-pixel alignment, which is the main missing piece of Fast/Faster R-CNN. Our method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN [36] by adding a branch for predicting segmentation masks on each Region of Interest (RoI), in parallel with the existing branch for classification and bounding box regression (Figure 1). The mask branch is a small FCN applied to each RoI, predicting a segmentation mask in a pixel-to-pixel manner. Mask R-CNN is simple to implement and train given the Faster R-CNN framework, which facilitates a wide range of flexible architecture designs. Additionally, the mask branch only adds a small computational overhead, enabling a fast system and rapid experimentation. In principle Mask R-CNN is an intuitive extension of Faster R-CNN, yet constructing the mask branch properly is critical for good results.

738,How can we solve the chllenges of image segmentation ?,"Instance segmentation is challenging because it requires the correct detection of all objects in an image while also precisely segmenting each instance. It therefore combines elements from the classical computer vision tasks of object detection, where the goal is to classify individual objects and localize each using a bounding box, and semantic segmentation, where the goal is to classify each pixel into a fixed set of categories without differentiating object instances.111Following common terminology, we use object detection to denote detection via bounding boxes, not masks, and semantic segmentation to denote per-pixel classification without differentiating instances. Yet we note that instance segmentation is both semantic and a form of detection. Given this, one might expect a complex method is required to achieve good results. However, we show that a surprisingly simple, flexible, and fast system can surpass prior state-of-the-art instance segmentation results. Most recently, Li et al. [26] combined the segment proposal system in [8] and object detection system in [11] for “fully convolutional instance segmentation” (FCIS). The common idea in [8, 11, 26] is to predict a set of position-sensitive output channels fully convolutionally. These channels simultaneously address object classes, boxes, and masks, making the system fast. But FCIS exhibits systematic errors on overlapping instances and creates spurious edges (Figure 6), showing that it is challenged by the fundamental difficulties of segmenting instances. Mask R-CNN outputs are visualized in Figures 2 and 5. Mask R-CNN achieves good results even under challenging conditions. In Figure 6 we compare our Mask R-CNN baseline and FCIS+++ [26]. FCIS+++ exhibits systematic artifacts on overlapping instances, suggesting that it is challenged by the fundamental difficulty of instance segmentation. Mask R-CNN shows no such artifacts.","In this paper, It is shown that a surprisingly simple, flexible, and fast system can surpass prior state-of-the-art instance segmentation results.

739,Was the GPT3 model finetuned on Self-Instruct also finetuned only on 50k instances?,"To evaluate SELF-INSTRUCT empirically, we run this framework on GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), which is a vanilla LM (§4). The iterative SELF-INSTRUCT process on this model leads to about 52k instructions, paired with about 82K instance inputs and target outputs. We observe that the resulting data provides a diverse range of creative tasks and over 50% of them have less than 0.3 ROUGE-L overlaps with the seed instructions (§4.2). On this resulting data, we build GPT3SELF-INST by fine-tuning GPT3 (i.e., the same model used for generating the instructional data). We evaluate GPT3SELF-INST in comparison to various other models on both typical NLP tasks included in SUPER-NATURALINSTRUCTIONS (Wang et al., 2022), and a set of new instructions that are created for novel usage of instruction-following models (§5). The SUPERNI results indicate that GPT3SELF-INST outperforms GPT3 (the original model) by a large margin (+33.1%) and nearly matches the performance of InstructGPT001. Moreover, our human evaluation on the newly-created instruction set shows that GPT3SELF-INST demonstrates a broad range of instruction-following ability, outperforming models trained on other publicly available instruction datasets and leaving only a 5% gap behind InstructGPT001.","Based on the introduction, it appears as though the authors may have finetuned their GPT3-Self Instruct model with 82k samples.","In ""character""-delimited models, OOV words are converted into sequences of special tokens with prefixes, whereas in ""word""-delimited models, OOV words are collapsed into a single UNK symbol",0.0487804828316483,0.0,0.0487804828316483,1.1348017612063048,14.85079267130154,11.971567976960308,0.0641025641025641,0.0099009900990099,0.1933712512254715,0.4150776693944542,0.1933711916208267,0.4223366379737854,0.009898215494517,0.25,0.7469535076791681,0.7675899589413717
740,Why is it crucial for the pipeline to identify whether the instruction represents a classification task? How are classification tasks particularly distinct or special?,"Our pipeline for generating the instruction data consists of four steps: 1) instruction generation, 2) identifying whether the instruction represents a classification task or not, 3) instance generation with the input-first or the output-first approach, and 4) filtering low-quality data. Because we need two different approaches for classification and non-classification tasks, we next identify whether the generated instruction represents a classification task or not.333More concretely, we regard tasks that have a limited and small output label space as classification tasks.We prompt vanilla GPT3 few-shot to determine this, using 12 classification instructions and 19 non-classification instructions from the seed tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 7. Given the instructions and their task type, we generate instances for each instruction independently. This is challenging because it requires the model to understand what the target task is, based on the instruction, figure out what additional input fields are needed and generate them, and finally complete the task by producing the output. We found that pretrained language models can achieve this to a large extent when prompted with instruction-input-output in-context examples from other tasks.A natural way to do this is the Input-first Approach, where we can ask a language model to come up with the input fields first based on the instruction, and then produce the corresponding output. This generation order is similar to how models are used to respond to instruction and input, but here with in-context examples from other tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 8. However, we found that this approach can generate inputs biased toward one label, especially for classification tasks (e.g., for grammar error detection, it usually generates grammatical input). Therefore, we additionally propose an Output-first Approach for classification tasks, where we first gener-ate the possible class labels, and then condition the input generation on each class label. The prompting template is shown in Table 9.4 We apply the output-first approach to the classification tasks identified in the former step, and the input-first approach to the remaining non-classification tasks.","The main reason why this is a crucial step is because the authors’ pipeline uses a different approach for classification tasks. For non-classification tasks, the authors first prompt a language model to come up with the input fields require, then provide sample inputs, for which the language model generates outputs. However, for classification tasks, the authors first generate the list of classes, and then require the model to provide an example for that instruction for each class. They do this because the first approach, used for non-classification instructions, does not work well for unbalanced classes. This step, of identifying classification tasks, is important since it is not possible to use the same generation technique for both classification and non-classification tasks effectively with the same generation method.","Class imbalance for single stage detectors causes two problems: (1) training is inefficient as most locations are easy negatives that contribute no useful learning signal, and (2) en masse, the easy negatives can overwhelm training and lead to degenerate models",0.1043478217860115,0.0,0.0869565174381854,0.8779815117714268,27.028627452965488,22.41955095374774,0.0528301886792452,0.0032679738562091,0.4103584885597229,0.5732266931013988,0.4919832646846771,0.5179007053375244,0.0035586607783408,0.4,0.7602982026235791,0.8019109905729795
741,What are the existing public datasets that contain instructions for tuning large language models?,"The recent NLP literature has witnessed a tremendous amount of activity in building models that can follow natural language instructions (Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022, i.a.).These developments are powered by two key components: large pre-trained language models (LM) and human-written instruction data.PromptSource (Bach et al., 2022) and Super-NaturalInstructions (Wang et al., 2022) are two notable recent datasets that use extensive manual annotation for collecting instructions to construct T0 Bach et al.

To better access the practical value of instruction-following models, a subset of the authors curate a new set of instructions motivated by user-oriented applications.We first brainstorm different domains where large LMs may be useful (e.g., email writing, social media, productivity tools, entertainment, programming), then craft instructions related to each domain along with an input-output instance (again, input is optional). We aim to diversify the styles and formats of these tasks (e.g., instructions may be long or short; input/output may take the form of bullet points, tables, codes, equations, etc.).

Task-independent sentence representations are a type of representation that can be learned by a model to capture the meaning of sentences in a way that is not specific to any particular task or dataset. Embeddings, on the other hand, are a type of vector representation that maps words or sentences to a dense vector space, where similar words or sentences are close together in the vector space. While embeddings can be used for a variety of tasks, they are not necessarily task-independent, as the same embedding space may be used for different tasks",0.1999999951057852,0.0140845023289045,0.181818176923967,1.2180128147780134,22.1906187869403,19.55842738136289,0.2035153284671533,0.0106544901065449,0.2475394755601883,0.4771202886715914,0.2464855499565601,0.5137664079666138,0.0241450884269717,0.0,0.7751913159266839,0.7784656732781922
743,"If LMs have been found to be biased and limited in creativity, how would LMs be able to create instructions that cover a greater diversity of tasks compared to humans who might be able to imagine possible tasks?","Annotating large-scale instruction data can be challenging for humans because it requires 1) creativity to come up with novel tasks and 2) expertise for writing the labeled instances for each task.In this section, we detail our process for Self-Instruct, which refers to the pipeline of generating tasks with a vanilla pretrained language model itself and then conducting instruction tuning with this generated data in order to align the language model to follow instructions better. This pipeline is depicted in Figure 1. Self-Instruct is based on a finding that large pretrained language models can be prompted to generate new and novel instructions when presented with some existing instructions in the context. This provides us with a way to grow the instruction data from a small set of seed human-written instructions.We propose to generate a diverse set of instructions in a bootstrapping fashion. We initiate the task pool with 175 tasks (1 instruction and 1 instance for each task) written by our authors. For every step, we sample 8 task instructions from this pool as in-context examples.Of the 8 instructions, 6 are from the human-written tasks,and 2 are from the model-generated tasks in previous steps to promote diversity.The prompting template is shown in Table 6. To encourage diversity, a new instruction is added to the task pool only when its ROUGE-L overlap with any existing instruction is less than 0.7.We also exclude instructions that contain some specific keywords (e.g., images, pictures, graphs) that usually can not be processed by language models. When generating new instances for each instruction, we filter out instances that are exactly the same or those with the same input but different outputs. Despite the comprehensiveness of SuperNI in collecting existing NLP tasks, most of these NLP tasks were proposed for research purposes and skewed toward classification. To better access the practical value of instruction-following models, a subset of the authors curate a new set of instructions motivated by user-oriented applications.We first brainstorm different domains where large LMs may be useful (e.g., email writing, social media, productivity tools, entertainment, programming), then craft instructions related to each domain along with an input-output instance (again, input is optional). We aim to diversify the styles and formats of these tasks (e.g., instructions may be long or short; input/output may take the form of bullet points, tables, codes, equations, etc.). In total, we create 252 instructions with 1 instance per instruction. We believe it can serve as a testbed for evaluating how instruction-based models handle diverse and unfamiliar instructions. Table 4 presents a small portion of the 252 tasks. The whole test set will be available upon request. Self-Instruct depends on LMs, and it will inherit all the limitations that carry over with LMs.As recent studies have shown Razeghi et al. (2022); Kandpal et al. (2022), tail phenomena pose a serious challenge to the success of LMs. In other words, LMs’ largest gains correspond to the frequent uses of languages (head of the language use distribution), and there are minimal gains in the low-frequency contexts.Similarly, in the context of this work, it would not be surprising if the majority of the gains by Self-Instruct are skewed towardtasks or instructions that present more frequently in the pre-training corpus.As a consequence, the approach might show brittleness with respect to uncommon and creative instructions.","LMs might be able to create instructions covering a greater diversity of tasks since they are trained on a large corpus of material that encompasses the work of many humans. Additionally, the authors' proposed approach, Self-Instruct, uses a bootstrapping phase where humans provide the first set of instructions, and a LM uses those as examples to generate more instructions. Approaches such as these, combining the efforts of a human and a language model, might be one way to ensure LMs create a wider array of tasks. However, the authors do acknowledge that LMs are prone to be biased towards commonly occurring sequences, at the cost of rarer sequences, meaning that this is an open research question.","The main structural difference between applying R-GCN to entity classification and link prediction is the use of a tensor factorization model in the latter task. In entity classification, the R-GCN outputs a set of node representations that are directly used for classification, while in link prediction, the R-GCN outputs a set of node representations that are then used as input to a tensor factorization model to predict the missing links",0.1626016214687026,0.0236686345828235,0.1300812962654506,1.5171849375202056,29.010754246479088,26.468151587503613,0.1406752411575562,0.0066225165562913,0.1707925647497177,0.5134114902013502,0.1836391761898994,0.454554945230484,0.0192864899739782,0.0,0.7533376899048841,0.7416356337859751
744,What type of new tasks was Self-Instruct able to generate which were not seen in previous human-created instruction datasets?,"A series of recent works Zhou et al. (2022b); Ye et al. (2022); Singh et al. (2022); Honovich et al. (2022) generate instructions of a task given a few examples. While Self-Instruct also involves instruction generation, a major difference in our case is it is task-agnostic; we generate new tasks (instructions along with instances) from scratch. Annotating large-scale instruction data can be challenging for humans because it requires 1) creativity to come up with novel tasks and 2) expertise for writing the labeled instances for each task.In this section, we detail our process for Self-Instruct, which refers to the pipeline of generating tasks with a vanilla pretrained language model itself and then conducting instruction tuning with this generated data in order to align the language model to follow instructions better. This pipeline is depicted in Figure 1. To evaluate Self-Instruct empirically, we run this framework on GPT3 Brown et al. (2020), which is a vanilla LM (§4).The iterative Self-Instruct process on this model leads to about 52k instructions, paired with about 82K instance inputs and target outputs.We observe that the resulting data provides a diverse range of creative tasks and over 50% of them have less than 0.3 ROUGE-L overlaps with the seed instructions (§4.2).On this resulting data, we build GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} by fine-tuning GPT3 (i.e., the same model used for generating the instructional data).We evaluate GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} in comparison to various other models on both typical NLP tasks included in Super-NaturalInstructions Wang et al. (2022), and a set of new instructions that are created for novel usage of instruction-following models (§5).The SuperNI results indicate thatGPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} outperforms GPT3 (the original model) by a large margin (+33.1%) and nearly matches the performance of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. Moreover, our human evaluation on the newly-created instruction set shows that GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} demonstrates a broad range of instruction following ability, outperforming models trained on other publicly available instruction datasets and leaving only a 5% gap behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. In summary, our contributions are: (1) Self-Instruct, a method for inducing instruction-following capabilitywith minimal human-labeled data;(2) We demonstrate its effectiveness via extensive instruction-tuning experiments;(3) We release a large synthetic dataset of 52K instructions and a set of manually-written novel tasks for building and evaluating future instruction-following models.","The paper mentions that their model is used to generate 52,000 instructions and 82,000 input-output pairs, for a wide range of tasks, which the authors have made publicly available. It might be possible to find more information on the specific tasks that were created by looking at this synthetic dataset, but the paper itself does not contain concrete examples.","A recurrent state space refers to the set of internal states that an RNN or LSTM model uses to capture information from previous time steps, allowing it to process sequences of data",0.1445783087066339,0.0,0.1204819231644652,0.9515179626547374,27.99825935254133,23.55086122471571,0.1211571793468345,0.0057845263919016,0.2020591348409652,0.5417650255294126,0.2356186211109161,0.4739840626716614,0.0092597222762989,0.25,0.7429684258306097,0.7580108932458998
745,"Beyond correctness, why did the authors not evaluate the actual quality, meaning, or usefulness of the generated instructions?","So far, we have shown the quantity and diversity of the generated data, but its quality remains uncertain. To investigate this, we randomly sample 200 instructions and randomly select 1 instance per instruction. We asked an expert annotator (co-author of this work) to label whether each instance is correct or not, in terms of the instruction, the instance input, and the instance output.Evaluation results in Table 2 show that most of the generated instructions are meaningful, while the generated instances may contain more noise (to a reasonable extent). However, we found that even though the generations may contain errors, most of them are still in the correct format or even partially correct, which can provide useful guidance for training models to follow instructions. We listed a number of good generations and bad generations in Table 10 and Table 11 respectively. Evaluating models’ performance on this evaluation set of diverse tasks is extremely challenging because different tasks require different expertise. Indeed, many of these tasks cannot be measured by automatic metrics or even be judged by normal crowdworkers (e.g., writing a program, or converting first-order logic into natural language). To get a more faithful evaluation, we asked the authors of the instructions to judge model predictions. The evaluators were asked to rate the output based on whether it accurately and effectively completes the task. We implemented a four-level rating system for categorizing the quality of the models’ outputs, defined as follows: Figure 5 provides the performance of GPT3 model and its instruction-tuned counterparts on this newly written instruction set. As anticipated, the vanilla GPT3 language model is largely unable to respond to instructions, and all instruction-tuned models demonstrate comparatively higher performance,Nonetheless, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} (i.e., GPT3 model fine-tuned with Self-Instruct) outperforms those counterparts trained on T0 or SuperNI by a large margin, demonstrating the value of the generated data despite the noise.Compared with \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}} (c.f. footnote 1), GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is quite close in the performance—if we count acceptable response with minor imperfections (Rating-3) as valid, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is only 5% behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. Lastly, our evaluation confirms the impressive instruction-following ability of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{002}} & \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{003}} models. Although there are many factors behind this success, we conjecture that future work can largely benefit from improving the quality of our generated data by using human annotators or training a reward model to select better generations, similar to the algorithm used in Ouyang et al. (2022).","One reason to explain why the authors did not perform more comprehensive quality evaluation of the generated outputs is the difficulty in judging the output of the model. Some tasks cannot be quickly verified by the average human (one example the authors provide for this is converting first-order logic into natural language - a task that only experts with the appropriate domain knowledge can perform). However, despite this challenge, the authors do perform some analysis to gauge the overall quality of the generated samples. They randomly select 200 instructions, and for each sample they examine the quality of one instance within each instruction. Doing this evaluation reveals that their approach performs much better than a vanilla GPT3 (i.e. a bare-bones GPT3 with nothing else).",Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is used for monocular depth and camera motion estimation,0.0566037714328943,0.0,0.0377358469045925,0.3845113528492809,12.8510606863467,10.626341246876008,0.0198886237072394,0.0010732271113679,0.0586565174162387,0.5215437453070123,0.1191654577851295,0.4381304979324341,0.0040540128649685,0.0,0.7393590481601037,0.7325194403615227
746,How are T0 and Tk-INSTRUCT different?,"The recent NLP literature has witnessed a tremendous amount of activity in building models that can follow natural language instructions (Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022, i.a.).These developments are powered by two key components: large pre-trained language models (LM) and human-written instruction data.PromptSource (Bach et al., 2022) and Super-NaturalInstructions (Wang et al., 2022) are two notable recent datasets that use extensive manual annotation for collecting instructions to construct T0 Bach et al.

T0 and Tk-Instruct are two instruction-tuned models proposed in Sanh et al. (2022) and Wang et al.

The fact that they were published in the same year, use the same datasets, and probably try to achieve similar goals indicates that, either: (1) the work for both of these approaches was done concurrently (perhaps by different groups of authors) or (2) one work was inspired from the other and might have been an extension of that.

Based on the findings from Wang et al. (2022) and our early experiments, reducing the number of instances per task does not degrade the model’s generalization performance to unseen tasks. We make the following observations from the results in Table 3.Self-Instructboosts the instruction-following ability of GPT3 by a large margin. The vanilla GPT3 model basically cannot follow human instructions at all. Upon manual analysis, we find that it usually generates irrelevant and repetitive text, and does not know when to stop generation.Compared with other models that are not specifically trained for SuperNI, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} achieves better performance than T0 or the GPT3 finetuned on the T0 training set, which takes tremendous human labeling efforts. Notably, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} also nearly matches the performance of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}, which is trained with private user data and human-annotated labels. Models trained on SuperNI training set still achieve better performance on its evaluation set, which we attribute to the similar instruction style and formatting. However, we show that Self-Instruct still brings in additional gains when combined with the SuperNI training set, proving its value as complementary data.

(2022). We introduce Self-Instruct, a task-agnostic method to improve the instruction-following capabilities of language models via its own generation of instruction data (instruction, input, and output samples) and bootstrapping with it. Our method conducts instruction-tuning of the original model on the pruned subset of generated samples. On experimenting with vanilla GPT3, we observe a 33% absolute improvement over the original model on Super-NaturalInstructions. This performance is on par with \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}, which is trained with private user data and expensive human annotations. Furthermore, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks. Human evaluation on this set shows that tuning GPT3 with Self-Instruct outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5% absolute gap behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. We hope Self-Instruct can serve as the first step to align pretrained language models to follow human instructions, and future work can build on top of this data to improve instruction-following models.","While it does appear as though there is a measurable performance improvement from SuperNI to Self-Instruct, quantifying the impact and magnitude of that improvement is not straightforward.

The authors do claim that they outperform T0 or SuperNI by a large margin, which is strong evidence to suggest that the difference was indeed significant, but such claims must be taken with some grains of salt since authors are usually incentivized to show their models are the best.","Non-linear extension of NCA (Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2007)",0.0449438185885621,0.0,0.0224719084762026,0.3960199961971627,8.867693197793395,7.80161908681606,0.0138632162661737,0.0007267441860465,0.1143226772546768,0.2539389057084918,0.1557553559541702,0.226057231426239,0.0059424134972236,0.0,0.7542385450529737,0.7645075006876402

750,How are the results of the input-first and output-first approach different?,"Because we need two different approaches for classification and non-classification tasks, we next identify whether the generated instruction represents a classification task or not.333More concretely, we regard tasks that have a limited and small output label space as classification tasks.We prompt vanilla GPT3 few-shot to determine this, using 12 classification instructions and 19 non-classification instructions from the seed tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 7. Given the instructions and their task type, we generate instances for each instruction independently. This is challenging because it requires the model to understand what the target task is, based on the instruction, figure out what additional input fields are needed and generate them, and finally complete the task by producing the output. We found that pretrained language models can achieve this to a large extent when prompted with instruction-input-output in-context examples from other tasks.A natural way to do this is the Input-first Approach, where we can ask a language model to come up with the input fields first based on the instruction, and then produce the corresponding output. This generation order is similar to how models are used to respond to instruction and input, but here with in-context examples from other tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 8. However, we found that this approach can generate inputs biased toward one label, especially for classification tasks (e.g., for grammar error detection, it usually generates grammatical input). Therefore, we additionally propose anOutput-first Approach for classification tasks, where we first generate the possible class labels, and then condition the input generation on each class label. The prompting template is shown in Table 9.444In this work, we use a fixed set of seed tasks for prompting the instance generation, and thus only generate a small number of instances per task in one round. Future work can use randomly sampled tasks to prompt the model to generate a larger number of instances in multiple rounds. We apply the output-first approach to the classification tasks identified in the former step, and the input-first approach to the remaining non-classification tasks.","If by results, you are referring to the outputs of these approaches, then the final output will look very similar - the output for each instance will consist of a tuple of an (input, output) where input and output follow the instructions for a certain task. However, the order in which this output is generated will differ -- for example, in ""input first"" approach, the input is generated first, while in the output first case, the language model is conditioned to provide the required output. On the other hand, if, by results, you are referring to ""performance"" of both of these approaches, the authors mention that the input first approach performs very poorly on classification instances, which is why they proposed the alternative approach of output-first generation for classification tasks.","ILSVRC provides several added benefits over PASCAL-VOC, including:

751,Who were the authors of the instructions?,"The instruction data we want to generate contains a set of instructions \{I_{t}\}, each of which defines a task t in natural language. Each task has one or more input-output instances (X_{t},Y_{t}).A model M is expected to produce the output y, given the task instruction I_{t} and the instance input x: M(I_{t},x)=y,\;\mbox{for}\ (x,y)\in(X_{t},Y_{t}).Note that the instruction and instance input does not have a strict boundary in many cases. For example, “write an essay about school safety” can be a valid instruction that we expect models to respond to directly, while it can also be formulated as “write an essay about the following topic” as the instruction, and “school safety” as an instance input. To encourage the diversity of the data format, we allow such instructions that do not require additional input (i.e., x is empty). Self-Instruct is based on a finding that large pretrained language models can be prompted to generate new and novel instructions when presented with some existing instructions in the context. This provides us with a way to grow the instruction data from a small set of seed human-written instructions.We propose to generate a diverse set of instructions in a bootstrapping fashion. We initiate the task pool with 175 tasks (1 instruction and 1 instance for each task) written by our authors. For every step, we sample 8 task instructions from this pool as in-context examples.Of the 8 instructions, 6 are from the human-written tasks,and 2 are from the model-generated tasks in previous steps to promote diversity.The prompting template is shown in Table 6. So far, we have shown the quantity and diversity of the generated data, but its quality remains uncertain. To investigate this, we randomly sample 200 instructions and randomly select 1 instance per instruction. We asked an expert annotator (co-author of this work) to label whether each instance is correct or not, in terms of the instruction, the instance input, and the instance output.Evaluation results in Table 2 show that most of the generated instructions are meaningful, while the generated instances may contain more noise (to a reasonable extent). However, we found that even though the generations may contain errors, most of them are still in the correct format or even partially correct, which can provide useful guidance for training models to follow instructions. We listed a number of good generations and bad generations in Table 10 and Table 11 respectively. In summary, our contributions are: (1) Self-Instruct, a method for inducing instruction-following capabilitywith minimal human-labeled data;(2) We demonstrate its effectiveness via extensive instruction-tuning experiments;(3) We release a large synthetic dataset of 52K instructions and a set of manually-written novel tasks for building and evaluating future instruction-following models.","The authors of the paper created the first set of 175 instructions themselves.

753,Why are the gains of instruction-tuning higher for larger models?,"Because of Self-Instruct’s dependence on the inductive biases extracted from LMs, it might work best for larger models.If true, this may create barriers to access for those who may not have large computing resources.We hope future studies will carefully study the gains as a function of model size or various other parameters.It is worthwhile to note that instruction-tuning with human annotation also suffers from a similar limitation: gains of instruction-tuning are higher for larger model Wei et al.

Here we present an overview of the generated data. With the instruction-generated instruction data, we conduct instruction tuning for the GPT3 model itself (the “davinci” engine).

756,"Why do the authors claim that human feedback may be less important when their experiments showed that InstructGPT, which had human-generated data, outperformed their model without human-generated data?","To evaluate Self-Instruct empirically, we run this framework on GPT3 Brown et al. (2020), which is a vanilla LM (§4).The iterative Self-Instruct process on this model leads to about 52k instructions, paired with about 82K instance inputs and target outputs.We observe that the resulting data provides a diverse range of creative tasks and over 50% of them have less than 0.3 ROUGE-L overlaps with the seed instructions (§4.2).On this resulting data, we build GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} by fine-tuning GPT3 (i.e., the same model used for generating the instructional data).We evaluate GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} in comparison to various other models on both typical NLP tasks included in Super-NaturalInstructions Wang et al. (2022), and a set of new instructions that are created for novel usage of instruction-following models (§5).The SuperNI results indicate thatGPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} outperforms GPT3 (the original model) by a large margin (+33.1%) and nearly matches the performance of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. Moreover, our human evaluation on the newly-created instruction set shows that GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} demonstrates a broad range of instruction following ability, outperforming models trained on other publicly available instruction datasets and leaving only a 5% gap behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. We evaluate \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{}} Ouyang et al. (2022),which is developed by OpenAI based on GPT3 to follow human instructions better and has been found by the community to have impressive zero-shot abilities.There are various generations of these models,where newer ones use more expansive data or algorithmic novelties101010https://beta.openai.com/docs/model-index-for-researchers.For our SuperNI experiments in §5.3, we only compare with their text-davinci-001 engine, because their newer engines are trained with the latest user data and are likely to already see the SuperNI evaluation set. For our human evaluation of these models on newly written instructions, we include their 001, 002 and 003 engines for completeness. We make the following observations from the results in Table 3.Self-Instructboosts the instruction-following ability of GPT3 by a large margin. The vanilla GPT3 model basically cannot follow human instructions at all. Upon manual analysis, we find that it usually generates irrelevant and repetitive text, and does not know when to stop generation.Compared with other models that are not specifically trained for SuperNI, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} achieves better performance than T0 or the GPT3 finetuned on the T0 training set, which takes tremendous human labeling efforts. Notably, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} also nearly matches the performance of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}, which is trained with private user data and human-annotated labels. Figure 5 provides the performance of GPT3 model and its instruction-tuned counterparts on this newly written instruction set. As anticipated, the vanilla GPT3 language model is largely unable to respond to instructions, and all instruction-tuned models demonstrate comparatively higher performance,Nonetheless, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} (i.e., GPT3 model fine-tuned with Self-Instruct) outperforms those counterparts trained on T0 or SuperNI by a large margin, demonstrating the value of the generated data despite the noise.Compared with \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}} (c.f. footnote 1), GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is quite close in the performance—if we count acceptable response with minor imperfections (Rating-3) as valid, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} is only 5% behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. Lastly, our evaluation confirms the impressive instruction-following ability of \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{002}} & \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{003}} models. Although there are many factors behind this success, we conjecture that future work can largely benefit from improving the quality of our generated data by using human annotators or training a reward model to select better generations, similar to the algorithm used in Ouyang et al. (2022). A series of works have found evidence that vanilla language models can be effective at following general language instructions if tuned with annotated “instructional” data – datasets containing language instructional commands and their desired outcome based on human judgement Weller et al. (2020); Mishra et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2022); Wei et al. (2022); Sanh et al. (2022); Ouyang et al. (2022); Parmar et al. (2022); Scialom et al. (2022); Chung et al. (2022); Luo et al. (2022); Puri et al. (2022); Yin et al. (2022); Chakrabarty et al. (2022); Lin et al. (2022); Gupta et al. (2022); Muennighoff et al. (2022).Additionally, they show a direct correlation between the size and diversity of the “instructional” data and the generalizability of resulting models to unseen tasks.Since these developments depend on human annotated “instructional” data, this poses a bottleneck for progress toward more generalizable models(for example see Fig. 5a in Wang et al., 2022).Our work aims to tackle this bottleneck by reducing the dependence on human annotators. (H_{1})Human feedback is a necessary and indispensable aspect of instruction-tuning as LMs need to learn about issues that were not quite learned during pre-training.(H_{2})Human feedback is an optional aspect of instruction-tuning as LMs are already quite familiar with instructions from their pre-training. Observing the human feedback is merely a lightweight process for aligning their pre-training distribution/objective which might be replaceable with a different process.While the reality probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes, we conjecturethat it is closer to H_{2}, particularly for larger models.This intuition, that LMs already know much about language instructions, is a key motivation for Self-Instruct and is also supported by its empirical success. We introduce Self-Instruct, a task-agnostic method to improve the instruction-following capabilities of language models via its own generation of instruction data (instruction, input, and output samples) and bootstrapping with it. Our method conducts instruction-tuning of the original model on the pruned subset of generated samples. On experimenting with vanilla GPT3, we observe a 33% absolute improvement over the original model on Super-NaturalInstructions. This performance is on par with \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}, which is trained with private user data and expensive human annotations. Furthermore, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks. Human evaluation on this set shows that tuning GPT3 with Self-Instruct outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5% absolute gap behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}. We hope Self-Instruct can serve as the first step to align pretrained language models to follow human instructions, and future work can build on top of this data to improve instruction-following models. Additionally, despite the remarkable performance of models like \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{}} Ouyang et al. (2022), their construction process remains quite opaque.In particular, the role of data has remained understudied due to limited transparency and data released by major corporate entities behind these key models.Addressing such challenges necessitates the creation of a large-scale, public dataset covering a broad range of tasks.","The authors claim that human feedback might not be essential since their model is able to almost meet the performance of InstructGPT despite not having access to private human-generated training data or manual annotations. They claim that their model's success, of almost reaching InstructGPT performance with only a 5% gap is a strong indication that human data, while useful is not necessarily essential for teaching models how to follow instructions. Additionally, they point out that their work is merely a beginning step in research in this field - while numerous studies have successfully used human annotations to improve performance, studies that attempt to remove the human requirement have not been as explored. Also, the authors do acknowledge that the truth is somewhere in between the two extremes of (1) human instructional data is essential, or (2) such data is largely optional, and similar results can be achieved without it.",To capture the smooth and continuous nature of expressive parameters,0.0540540524145767,0.0,0.0540540524145767,0.2845952959425684,9.902436216336191,8.35516055739932,0.0132978723404255,0.000684462696783,0.1289060413837433,0.4894892084805261,0.216370552778244,0.2098219394683838,0.0014419904242607,1.0,0.7817065581756794,0.7583396685940903

758,What is the motivation behind learning disentangled representations of data ?,"An oft-stated motivation for learning disentangled representations of data with deep generative models is a desire to achieve interpretability [5, 10]—particularly the decomposability [see §3.2.1 in 33] of latent representations to admit intuitive explanations.Most work has focused on capturing purely independent factors of variation [10, 7, 16, 25, 4, 57, 3, 8, 17, 15, 59], typically evaluating this using purpose-built, synthetic data [15, 17, 25], whose generative factors are independent by construction. In this work, we explored and analysed the fundamental characteristics of learning disentangled representations, and showed how these can be generalised to a more general framework of decomposition [33].We characterised the learning of decomposed latent representation with vaes in terms of the control of two factors:i) overlap in the latent space between encodings of different datapoints, andii) regularisation of the aggregate encoding distribution to the given prior, which encodes the structure one would wish for the latent space to have.",The motivation behind learning disentangled representations of data is a desire to achieve interpretability particularly the decomposability of latent representations to admit intuitive explanations.

759,What is the aim of using VAEs ?,"Of particular relevance to this work are approaches that explore disentanglement in the context of vaes [17, 3, 51, 25, 8, 16].Here one aims to achieve independence between the dimensions of the aggregate encoding, typically defined asq_{\phi}(\bm{z})\triangleq\operatorname{{}\mathbb{E}}_{p_{\mathcal{D}}(\bm{x})}\left[q(\bm{z}|\bm{x})\right]\approx\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n}q(\bm{z}|\bm{x}_{i}).The significance of q_{\phi}(\bm{z}) is that it is the marginal distribution induced on the latents by sampling a datapoint and then using the encoder to sample an encoding given that datapoint. It can thus informally be thought of as the pushforward distribution for “sampling” representations in the latent space. We characterise the decomposition of latent spaces in vaes to be the fulfilment of two factors (as shown in Figure 1):a.An “appropriate” level of overlap in the latent space—ensuring that the range of latent values capable of encoding a particular datapoint is neither too small, nor too large.This is, in general, dictated by the level of stochasticity in the encoder: the noisier the encoding process is, the higher the number of datapoints which can plausibly give rise to a particular encoding.b.The aggregate encoding q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) matching the prior p\left(\bm{z}\right), where the latter expresses the desired dependency structure between latents. We posit a generalisation of disentanglement in vaes—decomposing their latent representations—that can help avoid such pitfalls.We characterise decomposition in vaes as the fulfilment of two factors:a) the latent encodings of data having an appropriate level of overlap, andb) the aggregate encoding of data conforming to a desired structure, represented through the prior.We emphasize that neither of these factors is sufficient in isolation: withoutan appropriate level of overlap, encodings can degrade to a lookup tablewhere the latents convey little information about data, and without the aggregate encoding of data following a desired structure, the encodings do not decompose as desired.",The aim to use VAEs is to explore their decomposition capability to fulfill latent encoding of overlapping data and aggregate encoding of this data conforming to desired structure.

761,What is Disentanglement ?,"Much of the prior work in the field has either implicitly or explicitly presumed a slightly more ambitious definition of disentanglement than considered above: that it is a measure of how well one captures true factors of variation (which happen to be independent by construction for synthetic data), rather than just independent factors.After all, if we wish for our learned representations to be interpretable, it is necessary for the latent variables to take on clear-cut meaning. The commonly assumed notion of disentanglement is quite restrictive for complex models where the true generative factors are not independent, very large in number, or where it cannot be reasonably assumed that there is a well-defined set of “true” generative factors (as will be the case for many, if not most, real datasets).To this end, we introduce a generalization of disentanglement, decomposition, which at a high-level can be thought of as imposing a desired structure on the learned representations.This permits disentanglement as a special case, for which the desired structure is that q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) factors along its dimensions. Disentanglement implicitly makes a choice of decomposition: that the latent features are independent of one another.We make this explicit and exploit it to both provide improvement to disentanglement through judicious choices of structure in the prior, and to introduce a more general framework flexible enough to capture alternate, more complex, notions of decomposition such as sparsity, clustering, hierarchical structuring, or independent subspaces. Disentanglement, as typically employed in literature, refers to independence among features in a representation [5, 15, 18].Conceptually, however, it has a long history, far longer than we could reasonably do justice here, and is far from specific to vaes.The idea stems back to traditional methods such as ICA [58, 23] and conventional autoencoders [50], through to a range of modern approaches employing deep learning [47, 36, 9, 37, 1, 19, 11].","Disentanglement refers to independence among features in a representation.

764,What is the effect of having larger values of β ?,"Taken together, this implies that the \beta-vae’s ability to encourage disentanglement is predominantly through direct control over the level of overlap.It places no other direct constraint on the latents to disentangle (although in some cases, the annealed prior may inadvertently encourage better disentanglement), but instead helps avoid the pitfalls of inappropriate overlap.Amongst other things, this explains why large \beta is not universally beneficial for disentanglement, as the level of overlap can be increased too far. It should be noted, however, that the value of \beta can indirectly influence the level of disentanglement when using a mean-field assumption for the encoder distribution (i.e. restricting S_{\phi}(x) to be diagonal).As noted by Stühmer et al. [52], Rolinek et al. [49], increasing \beta can reinforce existing inductive biases, wherein mean-field assumptions encourage representations which reduce dependence between the latent dimensions [55]. We see in Figure 3 that increasing \beta increases the level of overlap in q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right), as a consequence of increasing the encoder variance for individual datapoints.When \beta is too large, the encoding of a datapoint loses meaning.Also, as a single datapoint encodes to a Gaussian distribution, q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) is unable to match p\left(\bm{z}\right) exactly.Because q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right)\rightarrow q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) when \beta\rightarrow\infty, this in turn means thatoverly large values of \beta actually cause a mismatch between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right) (see top right of Figure 3).Increasing \alpha, instead always improved the match between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right).Here, the finiteness of the dataset and the choice of divergence results in an increase in overlap with increasing \alpha, but only up to the level required for a non-negligible overlap between the nearby datapoints: large values of \alpha did not cause the encodings to collapse to a mode.","Large \beta is not universally beneficial for disentanglement, as the level of overlap can be increased too far.

765,Does β-VAE's objective control overlap ?,"Taken together, this implies that the \beta-vae’s ability to encourage disentanglement is predominantly through direct control over the level of overlap.It places no other direct constraint on the latents to disentangle (although in some cases, the annealed prior may inadvertently encourage better disentanglement), but instead helps avoid the pitfalls of inappropriate overlap.Amongst other things, this explains why large \beta is not universally beneficial for disentanglement, as the level of overlap can be increased too far. This shows that the \beta-vae objective does not directly encourage latent variables to take on meaningful representations when using the standard choice of an isotropic Gaussian prior.In fact, on its own, it encourages latent representations which match the true generative factors no more than it encourages any arbitrary rotation of these factors, with such rotations capable of exhibiting strong correlations between latents.This view is further supported by our empirical results (see Figure 2), where we did not observe any gains in disentanglement (using the metric from Kim and Mnih [25]) from increasing \beta>0 with an isotropic Gaussian prior trained on the 2D Shapes dataset [38].It may also go some way to explaining the extremely high levels of variation we found in the disentanglement-metric scores between different random seeds at train time. Given the characterisation set out above, we now develop an objective that incorporates the effect of both factors (a) and (b).Our analysis of the \beta-vae tells us that its objective allows direct control over the level of overlap, i.e. factor Item a.To incorporate direct control over the regularisation Item b between the marginal posterior and the prior, we add a divergence term \mathbb{D}(q_{{\phi}}\left(z\right),p(\bm{z})), yielding\displaystyle\begin{split}\mathcal{L}_{\alpha,\beta}&(\bm{x})=\operatorname{{}\mathbb{E}}_{q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\mid\bm{x}\right)}\left[\log p_{{\theta}}\left(\bm{x}\mid\bm{z}\right)\right]\\&-\beta~{}\operatorname{\scalebox{0.95}{\text{KL}}}\left(q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\mid\bm{x}\right)\,\|\;p(\bm{z})\right)-\alpha~{}\mathbb{D}(q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right),p(\bm{z}))\end{split}(7)allowing control over how much factors (a) and (b) are enforced, through appropriate setting of \beta and \alpha respectively. Connecting prior work on disentanglement to this framework, we analysed the \beta-vae objective to show that its contribution to disentangling is primarily through direct control of the level of overlap between encodings of the data, expressed by maximising the entropy of the encoding distribution.In the commonly encountered case of assuming an isotropic Gaussian prior and an independent Gaussian posterior, we showed that control of overlap is the only effect of the \beta-vae.Motivated by this observation, we developed an alternate objective for the elbo that allows control of the two factors of decomposability through an additional regularisation term.We then conducted empirical evaluations using this objective, targeting alternate forms of decompositions such as clustering and sparsity, and observed the effect of varying the extent of regularisation to the prior on the quality of the resulting clustering and sparseness of the learnt embeddings.The results indicate that we were successful in attaining those decompositions. To connect our framework with existing approaches for encouraging disentanglement, we provide a theoretical analysis of the \beta-vae [17, 3, 2], and show that it typically only allows control of latent overlap, the first decomposition factor.We show that it can be interpreted, up to a constant offset, as the standard vae objective with its prior annealed as p_{{\theta}}\left(\bm{z}\right)^{\beta} and an additional maximum entropy regularization of the encoder that increases the stochasticity of the encodings.Specialising this result for the typical choice of a Gaussian encoder and isotropic Gaussian prior indicates that the \beta-vae, up to a scaling of the latent space, is equivalent to the vae plus a regulariser encouraging higher encoder variance.Moreover, this objective is invariant to rotations of the learned latent representation, meaning that it does not, on its own, encourage the latent variables to take on meaningful representations any more than an arbitrary rotation of them.","The \beta-vae objective to show that its contribution to disentangling is primarily through direct control of the level of overlap between encodings of the data, expressed by maximising the entropy of the encoding distribution. \beta-vae’s ability to encourage disentanglement is predominantly through direct control over the level of overlap.

766,What is the purpose of using a non-isotropic Gaussian prior in the VAE model?,"Figure 2 demonstrates that notable improvements in disentanglement can be achieved by using non-isotropic priors:for a given reconstruction loss, implicitly fixed by \beta, non-isotropic Gaussian priors got better disentanglement scores, with further improvement achieved when the prior variance is learnt.With a product of Student-t priors p_{\nu}(\bm{z}) (noting p_{\nu}(\bm{z})\rightarrow\mathcal{N}(\bm{z};\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}) as \nu\rightarrow\infty), reducing \nu only incurred a minor reconstruction penalty, for improved disentanglement.Interestingly,very low values of \nu caused the disentanglement score to drop again (though still giving higher values than the Gaussian).We speculate that this may be related to the effect of heavy tails on the disentanglement metric itself, rather than being an objectively worse disentanglement.Another interesting result was that for an isotropic Gaussian prior, as per the original \beta-vae setup, no gains at all were achieved in disentanglement by increasing \beta.","the purpose of using a non-isotropic Gaussian prior in the VAE model is to get better disentanglement scores, with further improvement achieved when the prior variance is learnt","A 10-class handwritten digit dataset introduced by LeCun et al. in 1998, widely used in deep learning and still popular today despite calls for its replacement",0.0408163215326953,0.0,0.0408163215326953,1.4783033065109372,22.33356975374884,17.637580820184642,0.0692041522491349,0.0092002830856334,0.2227695733308792,0.3460702726950393,0.2131558358669281,0.3224377036094665,0.005971950054043,,0.6984069591048582,0.721004790841759
767,How controlling the variance specifically affects the level of overlap?,"We see in Figure 3 that increasing \beta increases the level of overlap in q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right), as a consequence of increasing the encoder variance for individual datapoints.When \beta is too large, the encoding of a datapoint loses meaning.Also, as a single datapoint encodes to a Gaussian distribution, q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) is unable to match p\left(\bm{z}\right) exactly.Because q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right)\rightarrow q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) when \beta\rightarrow\infty, this in turn means thatoverly large values of \beta actually cause a mismatch between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right) (see top right of Figure 3).Increasing \alpha, instead always improved the match between q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right) and p\left(\bm{z}\right).Here, the finiteness of the dataset and the choice of divergence results in an increase in overlap with increasing \alpha, but only up to the level required for a non-negligible overlap between the nearby datapoints: large values of \alpha did not cause the encodings to collapse to a mode. However, when the encoder is unimodal with fixed form (in particularly the tail behaviour is fixed) and the prior is well-characterised by Euclidean distances, then these factors have a substantially reduced ability to vary for a given I(\bm{x};\bm{z}), which subsequently becomes a good characterisation of the level of overlap.When q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) is Gaussian, controlling the variance of q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}|\bm{x}\right) (with a fixed q_{{\phi}}\left(\bm{z}\right)) should similarly provide an effective means of achieving the desired overlap behaviour.As this is the most common use case, we leave the development of more a general definition of overlap to future work, simply noting that this is an important consideration when using flexible encoder distributions.",Controlling the variance is effective means of achieving the desired overlap behaviour.

768,How does the form of the encoding distribution affect the ability to uncover true generative factors in VAEs?,"The exact form of the encoding distribution is also important here.For example, imagine we restrict the encoder variance to be isotropic and then use a two dimensional prior where one latent dimension has a much larger variance than the other.It will be possible to store more information in the prior dimension with higher variance (as we can spread points out more relative to the encoder variance).Consequently, that dimension is more likely to correspond to an important factor of the generative process than the other.Of course, this does not imply that this is a true factor of variation in the generative process, but neither is the meaning that can be attributed to each dimension completely arbitrary.","The exact form of the encoding distribution affect the ability to uncover true generative factors in VAEs.

769,What is the role of encoding noise and the likelihood distribution in VAE representations?,"In concurrently published work, Locatello et al. [34] question the plausibility of learning unsupervised disentangled representations with meaningful features, based on theoretical analyses showing an equivalence class of generative models, many members of which could be entangled.Though their analysis is sound, we posit a counterargument to their conclusions, based on the stochastic nature of the encodings used during training.Namely, that this stochasticity means that they need not give rise to the same elbo scores (an important exception is the rotational invariance for isotropic Gaussian priors).Essentially, the encoding noise forces nearby encodings to relate to similar datapoints, while standard choices for the likelihood distribution (e.g. assuming conditional independence) ensure that information is stored in the encodings, not just in the generative network.These restrictions mean that the elbo prefers smooth representations and, provided the prior is not rotationally invariant, means that there no longer need be a class of different representations with the same elbo; simpler representations are preferred to more complex ones.","In VAE representation, the encoding noise forces nearby encodings to relate to similar datapoints, while standard choices for the likelihood distribution ensure that information is stored in the encodings, not just in the generative network","Autokeras is an automated machine learning (AutoML) library that helps in finding the best model architecture and hyperparameters for a given problem.

770,How does the β-VAE objective contribute to disentangling in this work?,"Taken together, this implies that the \beta-vae’s ability to encourage disentanglement is predominantly through direct control over the level of overlap.It places no other direct constraint on the latents to disentangle (although in some cases, the annealed prior may inadvertently encourage better disentanglement), but instead helps avoid the pitfalls of inappropriate overlap.Amongst other things, this explains why large \beta is not universally beneficial for disentanglement, as the level of overlap can be increased too far. Connecting prior work on disentanglement to this framework, we analysed the \beta-vae objective to show that its contribution to disentangling is primarily through direct control of the level of overlap between encodings of the data, expressed by maximising the entropy of the encoding distribution.In the commonly encountered case of assuming an isotropic Gaussian prior and an independent Gaussian posterior, we showed that control of overlap is the only effect of the \beta-vae.Motivated by this observation, we developed an alternate objective for the elbo that allows control of the two factors of decomposability through an additional regularisation term.We then conducted empirical evaluations using this objective, targeting alternate forms of decompositions such as clustering and sparsity, and observed the effect of varying the extent of regularisation to the prior on the quality of the resulting clustering and sparseness of the learnt embeddings.The results indicate that we were successful in attaining those decompositions. To connect our framework with existing approaches for encouraging disentanglement, we provide a theoretical analysis of the \beta-vae [17, 3, 2], and show that it typically only allows control of latent overlap, the first decomposition factor.We show that it can be interpreted, up to a constant offset, as the standard vae objective with its prior annealed as p_{{\theta}}\left(\bm{z}\right)^{\beta} and an additional maximum entropy regularization of the encoder that increases the stochasticity of the encodings.Specialising this result for the typical choice of a Gaussian encoder and isotropic Gaussian prior indicates that the \beta-vae, up to a scaling of the latent space, is equivalent to the vae plus a regulariser encouraging higher encoder variance.Moreover, this objective is invariant to rotations of the learned latent representation, meaning that it does not, on its own, encourage the latent variables to take on meaningful representations any more than an arbitrary rotation of them.","Tthe β-VAE objective to show that its contribution to disentangling is primarily through direct control of the level of overlap between encodings of the data, expressed by maximising the entropy of the encoding distribution.","By assuming all unobserved interactions are negative and using negative sampling strategies, such as random sampling or non-uniform distributions, to alleviate the computational burden and improve recommendation performance",0.0769230719304737,0.0,0.0769230719304737,1.34941169475663,24.898242001759908,19.88340172026537,0.0706214689265536,0.0084134615384615,0.1668720692396164,0.4240821381178448,0.1668721139430999,0.43458291888237,0.0049477580485405,,0.7754646763017808,0.7739550932046328

774,"What are identity shortcuts and projection shortcuts, and how are they used in the experiments?","Identity vs. Projection Shortcuts.We have shown that parameter-free, identity shortcuts help with training. Next we investigate projection shortcuts (Eqn.(2)).In Table 3 we compare three options: (A) zero-padding shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions, and all shortcuts are parameter-free (the same as Table 2 and Fig. 4 right); (B) projection shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions, and other shortcuts are identity; and (C) all shortcuts are projections. Table 3 shows that all three options are considerably better than the plain counterpart.B is slightly better than A. We argue that this is because the zero-padded dimensions in A indeed have no residual learning. C is marginally better than B, and we attribute this to the extra parameters introduced by many (thirteen) projection shortcuts. But the small differences among A/B/C indicate that projection shortcuts are not essential for addressing the degradation problem. So we do not use option C in the rest of this paper, to reduce memory/time complexity and model sizes.

In [44, 24], a few intermediate layers are directly connected to auxiliary classifiers for addressing vanishing/exploding gradients. The papers of [39, 38, 31, 47] propose methods for centering layer responses, gradients, and propagated errors, implemented by shortcut connections. In [44], an “inception” layer is composed of a shortcut branch and a few deeper branches. Concurrent with our work, “highway networks” [42, 43] present shortcut connections with gating functions [15]. These gates are data-dependent and have parameters, in contrast to our identity shortcuts that are parameter-free. When a gated shortcut is “closed” (approaching zero), the layers in highway networks represent non-residual functions. On the contrary, our formulation always learns residual functions; our identity shortcuts are never closed, and all information is always passed through, with additional residual functions to be learned. In addition, highway networks have not demonstrated accuracy gains with extremely increased depth (e.g., over 100 layers).",The shortcut connections presented in this paper are parameter free and always learn residual functions.

By selecting these three values for alpha (VTHarm, Concatd, and Pool), the model can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the input data while preserving the most important information.

790,What are the different approaches that have been used in face recognition technology over the years?,"Face recognition (FR) has been the prominent biometric technique for identity authentication and has been widely used in many areas, such as military, finance, public security and daily life. FR has been a long-standing research topic in the CVPR community. In the early 1990s, the study of FR became popular following the introduction of the historical Eigenface approach [1]. The milestones of feature-based FR over the past years are presented in Fig. 1, in which the times of four major technical streams are highlighted. The holistic approaches derive the low-dimensional representation through certain distribution assumptions, such as linear subspace [2][3][4], manifold [5][6][7], and sparse representation [8][9][10][11]. This idea dominated the FR community in the 1990s and 2000s. However, a well-known problem is that these theoretically plausible holistic methods fail to address the uncontrolled facial changes that deviate from their prior assumptions. In the early 2000s, this problem gave rise to local-feature-based FR. Gabor [12] and LBP [13], as well as their multilevel and high-dimensional extensions [14][15][16], achieved robust performance through some invariant properties of local filtering. Unfortunately, handcrafted features suffered from a lack of distinctiveness and compactness. In the early 2010s, learning-based local descriptors were introduced to the FR community [17][18][19], in which local filters are learned for better distinctiveness and the encoding codebook is learned for better compactness. However, these shallow representations still have an inevitable limitation on robustness against the complex nonlinear facial appearance variations. In general, traditional methods attempted to recognize human face by one or two layer representations, such as filtering responses, histogram of the feature codes, or distribution of the dictionary atoms. The research community studied intensively to separately improve the preprocessing, local descriptors, and feature transformation, but these approaches improved FR accuracy slowly. What’s worse, most methods aimed to address one aspect of unconstrained facial changes only, such as lighting, pose, expression, or disguise. There was no any integrated technique to address these unconstrained challenges integrally. As a result, with continuous efforts of more than a decade, “shallow” methods only improved the accuracy of the LFW benchmark to about 95% [15], which indicates that “shallow” methods are insufficient to extract stable identity feature invariant to real-world changes. Due to the insufficiency of this technical, facial recognition systems were often reported with unstable performance or failures with countless false alarms in real-world applications. In 2014, DeepFace [20] achieved the SOTA accuracy on the famous LFW benchmark [23], approaching human performance on the unconstrained condition for the first time (DeepFace: 97.35% vs. Human: 97.53%), by training a 9-layer model on 4 million facial images. Inspired by this work, research focus has shifted to deep-learning-based approaches, and the accuracy was dramatically boosted to above 99.80% in just three years. Deep learning technique has reshaped the research landscape of FR in almost all aspects such as algorithm designs, training/test datasets, application scenarios and even the evaluation protocols. Therefore, it is of great significance to review the breakthrough and rapid development process in recent years. There have been several surveys on FR [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and its subdomains, and they mostly summarized and compared a diverse set of techniques related to a specific FR scene, such as illumination-invariant FR [29], 3D FR [28], pose-invariant FR [30][31]. Unfortunately, due to their earlier publication dates, none of them covered the deep learning methodology that is most successful nowadays. This survey focuses only on recognition problem, and one can refer to Ranjan et al. [32] for a brief review of a full deep FR pipeline with detection and alignment, or refer to Jin et al. [33] for a survey of face alignment. Specifically, the major contributions of this survey are as follows: We present the development of face processing methods in chronological order in Fig. 12. As we can see from the figure, most papers attempted to perform face processing by autoencoder model in 2014 and 2015; while 3D model played an important role in 2016. GAN [40] has drawn substantial attention from the deep learning and computer vision community since it was first proposed by Goodfellow et al. It can be used in different fields and was also introduced into face processing in 2017. GAN can be used to perform “one-to-many augmentation” and “many-to-one normalization”, and it broke the limit that face synthesis should be done under supervised way. Although GAN has not been widely used in face processing for training and recognition, it has great latent capacity for preprocessing, for example, Dual-Agent GANs (DA-GAN) [56] won the 1st places on verification and identification tracks in the NIST IJB-A 2017 FR competitions.","Starting from the 1990s to the 2000s, holistic approaches were the most prominent direction in face recognition, Later on, local-feature-based face recognition was introduced. In the 2010s, shallow learning-based-local-descriptors were used. In 2014, the DeepFace, a deep learning-based model, was invented. And ever since, the state-of-the-art techniques were from deep learning-based approaches.","Zipf distribution and Uniform distribution differ in the way they allocate probability to words.

Due to the insufficiency of this technical, facial recognition systems were often reported with unstable performance or failures with countless false alarms in real-world applications. With the evolved architectures and advanced training techniques, such as batch normalization (BN), the network becomes deeper and the training becomes more controllable. Following these architectures in object classification, the networks in deep FR are also developed step by step, and the performance of deep FR is continually improving. We present these mainstream architectures of deep FR in Fig. 9. In 2014, DeepFace [20] was the first to use a nine-layer CNN with several locally connected layers. With 3D alignment for face processing, it reaches an accuracy of 97.35% on LFW. In 2015, FaceNet [38] used a large private dataset to train a GoogleNet. It adopted a triplet loss function based on triplets of roughly aligned matching/nonmatching face patches generated by a novel online triplet mining method and achieved good performance of 99.63%. In the same year, VGGface [37] designed a procedure to collect a large-scale dataset from the Internet. It trained the VGGNet on this dataset and then fine-tuned the networks via a triplet loss function similar to FaceNet. VGGface obtains an accuracy of 98.95%. In 2017, SphereFace [84] used a 64-layer ResNet architecture and proposed the angular softmax (A-Softmax) loss to learn discriminative face features with angular margin. It boosts the achieves to 99.42% on LFW. In the end of 2017, a new large-scale face dataset, namely VGGface2 [39], was introduced, which consists of large variations in pose, age, illumination, ethnicity and profession. Cao et al. first trained a SENet with MS-celeb-1M dataset [45] and then fine-tuned the model with VGGface2 [39], and achieved the SOTA performance on the IJB-A [41] and IJB-B [42].

Deep face recognition has been successfully applied on many user-cooperated applications, but the ubiquitous recognition applications in everywhere are still an ambitious goal. In practice, it is difficult to collect and label sufficient samples for innumerable scenes in real world. One promising solution is to first learn a general model and then transfer it to an application-specific scene. While deep domain adaptation [145] has recently been applied to reduce the algorithm bias on different scenes [148], different races [173], general solution to transfer face recognition is largely open.","Face recognition is widely used in the military, finance, public security, and daily life.","The authors designed the meta-path prediction task by defining a binary label for each meta-path in the heterogeneous graph, where a label of 1 indicates that the meta-path is present in the graph, and 0 otherwise",0.1951219467221892,0.0434782568147451,0.1951219467221892,2.2130448900792694,12.833450255787046,12.590154950943925,0.2862244897959183,0.0107913669064748,-0.0428161434829235,0.3578657671485259,-0.0428162142634391,0.2921709418296814,0.0063982233781589,,0.7447169813356829,0.7164330083113044
793,What are the three main modules of a face recognition system?,"Before a face image is fed to an FR module, face anti-spoofing, which recognizes whether the face is live or spoofed, is applied to avoid different types of attacks. Then, recognition can be performed. As shown in Fig. 3(c), an FR module consists of face processing, deep feature extraction and face matching, and it can be described as follows: As mentioned in [32], there are three modules needed for FR system, as shown in Fig. 3. First, a face detector is used to localize faces in images or videos. Second, with the facial landmark detector, the faces are aligned to normalized canonical coordinates. Third, the FR module is implemented with these aligned face images. We only focus on the FR module throughout the remainder of this paper.","The 3 main modules are: face detection, facial landmark detector, and FR module.","No.

Slanted triangular learning rates (STLR) and linear warmup followed by linear decay are not the same thing, although they both involve adjusting the learning rate during training.

794,How is deep learning used in the process of feature extraction in face recognition systems?,"For most applications, it is difficult to include the candidate faces during the training stage, which makes FR become a “zero-shot” learning task. Fortunately, since all human faces share a similar shape and texture, the representation learned from a small proportion of faces can generalize well to the rest. Based on this theory, a straightforward way to improve generalized performance is to include as many IDs as possible in the training set. For example, Internet giants such as Facebook and Google have reported their deep FR system trained by 10^{6}-10^{7} IDs [38, 20]. But all that changed in 2012 when AlexNet won the ImageNet competition by a large margin using a technique called deep learning [22]. Deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks, use a cascade of multiple layers of processing units for feature extraction and transformation. They learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction. The levels form a hierarchy of concepts, showing strong invariance to the face pose, lighting, and expression changes, as shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen from the figure that the first layer of the deep neural network is somewhat similar to the Gabor feature found by human scientists with years of experience. The second layer learns more complex texture features. The features of the third layer are more complex, and some simple structures have begun to appear, such as high-bridged nose and big eyes. In the fourth, the network output is enough to explain a certain facial attribute, which can make a special response to some clear abstract concepts such as smile, roar, and even blue eye. In conclusion, in deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), the lower layers automatically learn the features similar to Gabor and SIFT designed for years or even decades (such as initial layers in Fig. 2), and the higher layers further learn higher level abstraction. Finally, the combination of these higher level abstraction represents facial identity with unprecedented stability. 3D FR has inherent advantages over 2D methods, but 3D deep FR is not well developed due to the lack of large annotated 3D data. To enlarge 3D training datasets, most works use the methods of “one-to-many augmentation” to synthesize 3D faces. However, the effective methods for extracting deep features of 3D faces remain to be explored. Kim et al. [204] fine-tuned a 2D CNN with a small amount of 3D scans for 3D FR. Zulqarnain et al. [259] used a three-channel (corresponding to depth, azimuth and elevation angles of the normal vector) image as input and minimized the average prediction log-loss. Zhang et al. [260] first selected 30 feature points from the Candide-3 face model to characterize faces, then conducted the unsupervised pretraining of face depth data, and finally performed the supervised fine-tuning.",The deep learning model does feature extraction by processing the image through many layers and giving an encoding of the face that can be used to solve different FR tasks.

795,What are some challenges that researchers have encountered when generating 3D face images from 2D images?,"3D model. 3D face reconstruction is also a way to enrich the diversity of training data. They utilize 3D structure information to model the transformation between poses. 3D models first use 3D face data to obtain morphable displacement fields and then apply them to obtain 2D face data in different pose angles. There is a large number of papers about this domain, but we only focus on the 3D face reconstruction using deep methods or used for deep FR. In [47], Masi et al. generated face images with new intra-class facial appearance variations, including pose, shape and expression, and then trained a 19-layer VGGNet with both real and augmented data. Masi et al. [48] used generic 3D faces and rendered fixed views to reduce much of the computational effort. Richardson et al. [49] employed an iterative 3D CNN by using a secondary input channel to represent the previous network’s output as an image for reconstructing a 3D face as shown in Fig. 13. Dou et al. [51] used a multi-task CNN to divide 3D face reconstruction into neutral 3D reconstruction and expressive 3D reconstruction. Tran et al. [53] directly regressed 3D morphable face model (3DMM) [155] parameters from an input photo by a very deep CNN architecture. An et al. [156] synthesized face images with various poses and expressions using the 3DMM method, then reduced the gap between synthesized data and real data with the help of MMD. 3D FR has inherent advantages over 2D methods, but 3D deep FR is not well developed due to the lack of large annotated 3D data.

796,"How has the quality and diversity of generated 3D face images improved over time, and what advances have contributed to these improvements?","3D model. 3D face reconstruction is also a way to enrich the diversity of training data. They utilize 3D structure information to model the transformation between poses. 3D models first use 3D face data to obtain morphable displacement fields and then apply them to obtain 2D face data in different pose angles. There is a large number of papers about this domain, but we only focus on the 3D face reconstruction using deep methods or used for deep FR. In [47], Masi et al. generated face images with new intra-class facial appearance variations, including pose, shape and expression, and then trained a 19-layer VGGNet with both real and augmented data. Masi et al. [48] used generic 3D faces and rendered fixed views to reduce much of the computational effort. Richardson et al. [49] employed an iterative 3D CNN by using a secondary input channel to represent the previous network’s output as an image for reconstructing a 3D face as shown in Fig. 13. Dou et al. [51] used a multi-task CNN to divide 3D face reconstruction into neutral 3D reconstruction and expressive 3D reconstruction. Tran et al. [53] directly regressed 3D morphable face model (3DMM) [155] parameters from an input photo by a very deep CNN architecture. An et al. [156] synthesized face images with various poses and expressions using the 3DMM method, then reduced the gap between synthesized data and real data with the help of MMD.","The paper only talks about the line of work on 3D image reconstruction, in other words, the methods and approaches to reconstruct 3D face images.

797,"What are the main differences between the large-scale training datasets MS-Celeb-1M, VGGface2, and Megaface in terms of depth versus breadth, long tail distribution, and data engineering practices?	","Depth v.s. breadth. These large training sets are expanded from depth or breadth. VGGface2 provides a large-scale training dataset of depth, which have limited number of subjects but many images for each subjects. The depth of dataset enforces the trained model to address a wide range intra-class variations, such as lighting, age, and pose. In contrast, MS-Celeb-1M and Mageface (Challenge 2) offers large-scale training datasets of breadth, which contains many subject but limited images for each subjects. The breadth of dataset ensures the trained model to cover the sufficiently variable appearance of various people. Cao et al. [39] conducted a systematic studies on model training using VGGface2 and MS-Celeb-1M, and found an optimal model by first training on MS-Celeb-1M (breadth) and then fine-tuning on VGGface2 (depth). Long tail distribution. The utilization of long tail distribution is different among datasets. For example, in Challenge 2 of MS-Celeb-1M, the novel set specially uses the tailed data to study low-shot learning; central part of the long tail distribution is used by the Challenge 1 of MS-Celeb-1M and images’ number is approximately limited to 100 for each celebrity; VGGface and VGGface2 only use the head part to construct deep databases; Megaface utilizes the whole distribution to contain as many images as possible, the minimal number of images is 3 per person and the maximum is 2469. Data engineering. Several popular benchmarks, such as LFW unrestricted protocol, Megaface Challenge 1, MS-Celeb-1M Challenge 1&2, explicitly encourage researchers to collect and clean a large-scale data set for enhancing the capability of deep neural network. Although data engineering is a valuable problem to computer vision researchers, this protocol is more incline to the industry participants. As evidence, the leaderboards of these experiments are mostly occupied by the companies holding invincible hardwares and data scales. This phenomenon may not be beneficial for developments of new models in academic community.","In terms of depth vs breadth, VGGFace2 stands as the dataset with the most depth among the 3. Although it contains a smaller number of subjects, it includes a large number of images per subject. It lets models focus on intra-class variations such as lighting, age, pose, etc. On the other hand, MS-Celeb-1M and Megface are datasets of breadth, in other words, they contain a lot of subjects but not particularly many images per subject. They let models cover sufficiently different appearances of different people. In terms of long tail distribution, VGGFace2 uses the head part of the distribution, Megaface uses the entire distribution to have as many images as possible, and different challenges of MS-Celeb-1M use the central or long tail part of the distribution. In terms of data engineering, the Megaface and MS-Celeb-1M datasets are usually filtered and cleaned to increase the performance of trained models.

798,"What are some methods that have been proposed to address the security vulnerabilities of deep face recognition systems, such as presentation attacks and adversarial attacks?","With the success of FR techniques, various types of attacks, such as face spoofing and adversarial perturbations, are becoming large threats. Face spoofing involves presenting a fake face to the biometric sensor using a printed photograph, worn mask, or even an image displayed on another electronic device. In order to defense this type of attack, several methods are proposed [211, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279]. Atoum et al. [211] proposed a novel two-stream CNN in which the local features discriminate the spoof patches that are independent of the spatial face areas, and holistic depth maps ensure that the input live sample has a face-like depth. Yang et al. [273] trained a CNN using both a single frame and multiple frames with five scales as input, and using the live/spoof label as the output. Taken the sequence of video frames as input, Xu et al. [274] applied LSTM units on top of CNN to obtain end-to-end features to recognize spoofing faces which leveraged the local and dense property from convolution operation and learned the temporal structure using LSTM units. Li et al. [275] and Patel et al. [276] fine-tuned their networks from a pretrained model by training sets of real and fake images. Jourabloo et al. [277] proposed to inversely decompose a spoof face into the live face and the spoof noise pattern. Adversarial perturbation is the other type of attack which can be defined as the addition of a minimal vector r such that with addition of this vector into the input image x, i.e. (x+r), the deep learning models misclassifies the input while people will not. Recently, more and more work has begun to focus on solving this perturbation of FR. Goswami et al. [280] proposed to detect adversarial samples by characterizing abnormal filter response behavior in the hidden layers and increase the network’s robustness by removing the most problematic filters. Goel et al. [281] provided an open source implementation of adversarial detection and mitigation algorithms. Despite of progresses of anti-attack algorithms, attack methods are updated as well and remind us the need to further increase security and robustness in FR systems, for example, Mai et al. [282] proposed a neighborly de-convolutional neural network (NbNet) to reconstruct a fake face using the stolen deep templates. •Security issues. Presentation attack [289], adversarial attack [280, 281, 290], template attack [291] and digital manipulation attack [292, 293] are developing to threaten the security of deep face recognition systems. 1) Presentation attack with 3D silicone mask, which exhibits skin-like appearance and facial motion, challenges current anti-sproofing methods [294]. 2) Although adversarial perturbation detection and mitigation methods are recently proposed [280][281], the root cause of adversarial vulnerability is unclear and thus new types of adversarial attacks are still upgraded continuously [295, 296]. 3) The stolen deep feature template can be used to recover its facial appearance, and how to generate cancelable template without loss of accuracy is another important issue. 4) Digital manipulation attack, made feasible by GANs, can generate entirely or partially modified photorealistic faces by expression swap, identity swap, attribute manipulation and entire face synthesis, which remains a main challenge for the security of deep FR.","Despite some defense systems for face spoofing that use two-stream CNN, classification with CNN, and LSTM, there is still a presentation attack with a 3D model that can crack them. Also, since the root cause of adversarial perturbations is unclear, methods like detecting and removing vulnerable layers are insufficient. In order to mitigate all different types of FR attacks, continued research in this direction is necessary.",To ensure 100% accuracy by forcing the sole head to perform full attention to compare each token to all others,0.0789473648060943,0.0,0.0789473648060943,0.6331377889807558,19.83830663282963,16.061504478171106,0.028735632183908,0.0031645569620253,0.1650014370679855,0.4431142760945928,0.1952572762966156,0.272106409072876,0.0028451222602924,0.0,0.7448560271192929,0.7480995626072592
799,What are some common methods used in facial recognition and how do they compare in terms of effectiveness and challenges?,"Face recognition (FR) has been the prominent biometric technique for identity authentication and has been widely used in many areas, such as military, finance, public security and daily life. FR has been a long-standing research topic in the CVPR community. In the early 1990s, the study of FR became popular following the introduction of the historical Eigenface approach [1]. The milestones of feature-based FR over the past years are presented in Fig. 1, in which the times of four major technical streams are highlighted. The holistic approaches derive the low-dimensional representation through certain distribution assumptions, such as linear subspace [2][3][4], manifold [5][6][7], and sparse representation [8][9][10][11]. This idea dominated the FR community in the 1990s and 2000s. However, a well-known problem is that these theoretically plausible holistic methods fail to address the uncontrolled facial changes that deviate from their prior assumptions. In the early 2000s, this problem gave rise to local-feature-based FR. Gabor [12] and LBP [13], as well as their multilevel and high-dimensional extensions [14][15][16], achieved robust performance through some invariant properties of local filtering. Unfortunately, handcrafted features suffered from a lack of distinctiveness and compactness. In the early 2010s, learning-based local descriptors were introduced to the FR community [17][18][19], in which local filters are learned for better distinctiveness and the encoding codebook is learned for better compactness. However, these shallow representations still have an inevitable limitation on robustness against the complex nonlinear facial appearance variations. In general, traditional methods attempted to recognize human face by one or two layer representations, such as filtering responses, histogram of the feature codes, or distribution of the dictionary atoms. The research community studied intensively to separately improve the preprocessing, local descriptors, and feature transformation, but these approaches improved FR accuracy slowly. What’s worse, most methods aimed to address one aspect of unconstrained facial changes only, such as lighting, pose, expression, or disguise. There was no any integrated technique to address these unconstrained challenges integrally. As a result, with continuous efforts of more than a decade, “shallow” methods only improved the accuracy of the LFW benchmark to about 95% [15], which indicates that “shallow” methods are insufficient to extract stable identity feature invariant to real-world changes. Due to the insufficiency of this technical, facial recognition systems were often reported with unstable performance or failures with countless false alarms in real-world applications. In 2014, DeepFace [20] achieved the SOTA accuracy on the famous LFW benchmark [23], approaching human performance on the unconstrained condition for the first time (DeepFace: 97.35% vs. Human: 97.53%), by training a 9-layer model on 4 million facial images. Inspired by this work, research focus has shifted to deep-learning-based approaches, and the accuracy was dramatically boosted to above 99.80% in just three years. Deep learning technique has reshaped the research landscape of FR in almost all aspects such as algorithm designs, training/test datasets, application scenarios and even the evaluation protocols. Therefore, it is of great significance to review the breakthrough and rapid development process in recent years. There have been several surveys on FR [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and its subdomains, and they mostly summarized and compared a diverse set of techniques related to a specific FR scene, such as illumination-invariant FR [29], 3D FR [28], pose-invariant FR [30][31]. Unfortunately, due to their earlier publication dates, none of them covered the deep learning methodology that is most successful nowadays. This survey focuses only on recognition problem, and one can refer to Ranjan et al. [32] for a brief review of a full deep FR pipeline with detection and alignment, or refer to Jin et al. [33] for a survey of face alignment. Specifically, the major contributions of this survey are as follows: Despite the high accuracy in the LFW [23] and Megaface [44, 164] benchmarks, the performance of FR models still hardly meets the requirements in real-world application. A conjecture in industry is made that results of generic deep models can be improved simply by collecting big datasets of the target scene. However, this holds only to a certain degree. More and more concerns on privacy may make the collection and human-annotation of face data become illegal in the future. Therefore, significant efforts have been paid to design excellent algorithms to address the specific problems with limited data in these realistic scenes. In this section, we present several special algorithms of FR. •Privacy-preserving face recognition. With the leakage of biological data, privacy concerns are raising nowadays. Facial images can predict not only demographic information such as gender, age, or race, but even the genetic information [297]. Recently, the pioneer works such as Semi-Adversarial Networks [298, 299, 285] have explored to generate a recognizable biometric templates that can hidden some of the private information presented in the facial images. Further research on the principles of visual cryptography, signal mixing and image perturbation to protect users’ privacy on stored face templates are essential for addressing public concern on privacy. •Understanding deep face recognition. Deep face recognition systems are now believed to surpass human performance in most scenarios [300]. There are also some interesting attempts to apply deep models to assist human operators for face verification [183][300]. Despite this progress, many fundamental questions are still open, such as what is the “identity capacity” of a deep representation [301]? Why deep neural networks, rather than humans, are easily fooled by adversarial samples? While bigger and bigger training dataset by itself cannot solve this problem, deeper understanding on these questions may help us to build robust applications in real world. Recently, a new benchmark called TALFW has been proposed to explore this issue [93].","There are broadly 4 methods that are used in FR. Holistic methods were the first-ever attempt to solve the FR problem. But they were too primitive and could not account for uncontrolled facial changes that did not fit its assumptions. Then, there are local feature-based methods that try to extract invariant properties with local filtering. However, although better than holistic methods, these are also short of complexity and capacity to address the vastness of facial appearances. The first learning-based methods also lacked the robustness to address the non-linearity and complexity of FR. Also, the efforts that were made in this direction were too scattered and there were no traditional methods that could address the FR problem entirely. Afterward, deep learning based methods were introduced which surpassed the human ability in FR. Unfortunately, these methods are prone to adversarial noises and need large datasets. In particular, designing bigger and bigger datasets is becoming a privacy issue, that is yet to be handled by deep FR models.","Sure! Here's the answer to the question based on the provided context:

800,How does the contrastive loss function work in deep face recognition?,"Euclidean-distance-based loss is a metric learning method [118, 119] that embeds images into Euclidean space in which intra-variance is reduced and inter-variance is enlarged. The contrastive loss and the triplet loss are the commonly used loss functions. The contrastive loss [35, 21, 36, 61, 120] requires face image pairs, and then pulls together positive pairs and pushes apart negative pairs.\begin{split}\mathcal{L}=&y_{ij}max\left(0,\left\|f(x_{i})-f(x_{j})\right\|_{2}-\epsilon^{+}\right)\\&+(1-y_{ij})max\left(0,\epsilon^{-}-\left\|f(x_{i})-f(x_{j})\right\|_{2}\right)\end{split}(2)where y_{ij}=1 means x_{i} and x_{j} are matching samples and y_{ij}=0 means non-matching samples. f(\cdot) is the feature embedding, \epsilon^{+} and \epsilon^{-} control the margins of the matching and non-matching pairs respectively. DeepID2 [21] combined the face identification (softmax) and verification (contrastive loss) supervisory signals to learn a discriminative representation, and joint Bayesian (JB) was applied to obtain a robust embedding space. Extending from DeepID2 [21], DeepID2+ [35] increased the dimension of hidden representations and added supervision to early convolutional layers. DeepID3 [36] further introduced VGGNet and GoogleNet to their work. However, the main problem with the contrastive loss is that the margin parameters are often difficult to choose. Contrary to contrastive loss that considers the absolute distances of the matching pairs and non-matching pairs, triplet loss considers the relative difference of the distances between them. Along with FaceNet [38] proposed by Google, Triplet loss [38, 37, 81, 80, 58, 60] was introduced into FR. It requires the face triplets, and then it minimizes the distance between an anchor and a positive sample of the same identity and maximizes the distance between the anchor and a negative sample of a different identity. FaceNet made \left\|f(x_{i}^{a})-f(x_{i}^{p})\right\|_{2}^{2}+\alpha<-\left\|f(x_{i}^{a})-f(x_{i}^{n})\right\|_{2}^{2} using hard triplet face samples, where x_{i}^{a}, x_{i}^{p} and x_{i}^{n} are the anchor, positive and negative samples, respectively, \alpha is a margin and f(\cdot) represents a nonlinear transformation embedding an image into a feature space. Inspired by FaceNet [38], TPE [81] and TSE [80] learned a linear projection W to construct triplet loss. Other methods optimize deep models using both triplet loss and softmax loss [59, 58, 60, 121]. They first train networks with softmax and then fine-tune them with triplet loss.","In Euclidean space, contrastive loss, pulls together positive pairs and pushes apart negative pairs: \begin{split}\mathcal{L}=&y_{ij}max\left(0,\left\|f(x_{i})-f(x_{j})\right\|_{2}-\epsilon^{+}\right)\\&+(1-y_{ij})max\left(0,\epsilon^{-}-\left\|f(x_{i})-f(x_{j})\right\|_{2}\right)\end{split}(2)where y_{ij}=1 means x_{i} and x_{j} are matching samples and y_{ij}=0 means non-matching samples. f(\cdot) is the feature embedding, \epsilon^{+} and \epsilon^{-} control the margins of the matching and non-matching pairs respectively. However, the problem is that the margin parameters are difficult to choose.","The author uses K-mode instead of K-means because K-mode is more accurate for clustering categorical data, and it eliminates the restriction on numerical data while maintaining the efficacy of the K-mean pattern",0.1126760515611983,0.0227272681637405,0.1126760515611983,0.4308152356552487,20.71953333538029,18.05750600576836,0.0248756218905472,0.0060015003750937,0.0518939495086669,0.437522311423336,0.2075022310018539,0.4433383345603943,0.0132705254438225,0.0,0.7387991050100317,0.7498558739462733
801,How do angular/cosine-margin-based loss functions improve the separability of learned features in deep face recognition?	,"In 2017, people had a deeper understanding of loss function in deep FR and thought that samples should be separated more strictly to avoid misclassifying the difficult samples. Angular/cosine-margin-based loss [104, 84, 105, 106, 108] is proposed to make learned features potentially separable with a larger angular/cosine distance. The decision boundary in softmax loss is \left(W_{1}-W_{2}\right)x+b_{1}-b_{2}=0, where x is feature vector, W_{i} and b_{i} are weights and bias in softmax loss, respectively. Liu et al. [104] reformulated the original softmax loss into a large-margin softmax (L-Softmax) loss. They constrain b_{1}=b_{2}=0, so the decision boundaries for class 1 and class 2 become \left\|x\right\|\left(\left\|W_{1}\right\|cos\left(m\theta_{1}\right)-\left\|W_{2}\right\|cos\left(\theta_{2}\right)\right)=0 and \left\|x\right\|\left(\left\|W_{1}\right\|\left\|W_{2}\right\|cos\left(\theta_{1}\right)-cos\left(m\theta_{2}\right)\right)=0, respectively, where m is a positive integer introducing an angular margin, and \theta_{i} is the angle between W_{i} and x. Due to the non-monotonicity of the cosine function, a piece-wise function is applied in L-softmax to guarantee the monotonicity. The loss function is defined as follows:\mathcal{L}_{i}=-log\left(\frac{e^{\left\|W_{yi}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|\varphi(\theta_{yi})}}{e^{\left\|W_{yi}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|\varphi(\theta_{yi})+\sum_{j\neq y_{i}}e^{\left\|W_{yi}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|cos(\theta_{j})}}}\right)(4)where\varphi(\theta)=(-1)^{k}cos(m\theta)-2k,\theta\in\left[\frac{k\pi}{m},\frac{(k+1)\pi}{m}\right](5)Considering that L-Softmax is difficult to converge, it is always combined with softmax loss to facilitate and ensure the convergence. Therefore, the loss function is changed into: f_{y_{i}}=\frac{\lambda\left\|W_{y_{i}}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|cos(\theta_{y_{i}})+\left\|W_{y_{i}}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|\varphi(\theta_{y_{i}})}{1+\lambda}, where \lambda is a dynamic hyper-parameter. Based on L-Softmax, A-Softmax loss [84] further normalized the weight W by L2 norm (\left\|W\right\|=1) such that the normalized vector will lie on a hypersphere, and then the discriminative face features can be learned on a hypersphere manifold with an angular margin (Fig. 6). Liu et al. [108] introduced a deep hyperspherical convolution network (SphereNet) that adopts hyperspherical convolution as its basic convolution operator and is supervised by angular-margin-based loss. To overcome the optimization difficulty of L-Softmax and A-Softmax, which incorporate the angular margin in a multiplicative manner, ArcFace [106] and CosFace [105], AMS loss [107] respectively introduced an additive angular/cosine margin cos(\theta+m) and cos\theta-m. They are extremely easy to implement without tricky hyper-parameters \lambda, and are more clear and able to converge without the softmax supervision. The decision boundaries under the binary classification case are given in Table V. Based on large margin, FairLoss [122] and AdaptiveFace [123] further proposed to adjust the margins for different classes adaptively to address the problem of unbalanced data. Compared to Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss explicitly adds discriminative constraints on a hypershpere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that human face lies on a manifold. However, Wang et al. [124] showed that angular/cosine-margin-based loss can achieve better results on a clean dataset, but is vulnerable to noise and becomes worse than center loss and softmax in the high-noise region as shown in Fig. 7.","Angular/cosine-margin-based loss allows the separation of learned features with larger angular/cosine distance. When the bias is removed and the weights are normalized in softmax, the outcome only depends on the angle between the weight and the features. Based on the prior that the human face lies on a manifold, the angular/cosine-margin-based loss explicitly adds discriminative constraints on a hypersphere manifold.",STL stands for Single-Task Learning,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.536516083151229,7.15238706236342,0.0169491525423728,0.0008326394671107,0.1716706901788711,0.4559904454261299,0.2181636542081833,0.1667801588773727,0.007404020208688,,0.6963350218716049,0.731474384230059
802,How does normalizing the features and weights in the softmax loss function improve the performance of deep face recognition systems?	,"In 2017, in addition to reformulating softmax loss into an angular/cosine-margin-based loss as mentioned above, some works tries to normalize the features and weights in loss functions to improve the model performance, which can be written as follows:\hat{W}=\frac{W}{\left\|W\right\|},\hat{x}=\alpha\frac{x}{\left\|x\right\|}(6)where \alpha is a scaling parameter, x is the learned feature vector, W is weight of last fully connected layer. Scaling x to a fixed radius \alpha is important, as Wang et al. [110] proved that normalizing both features and weights to 1 will make the softmax loss become trapped at a very high value on the training set. After that, the loss function, e.g. softmax, can be performed using the normalized features and weights.  Some papers [84, 108] first normalized the weights only and then added angular/cosine margin into loss functions to make the learned features be discriminative. In contrast, some works, such as [109, 111], adopted feature normalization only to overcome the bias to the sample distribution of the softmax. Based on the observation of [125] that the L2-norm of features learned using the softmax loss is informative of the quality of the face, L2-softmax [109] enforced all the features to have the same L2-norm by feature normalization such that similar attention is given to good quality frontal faces and blurry faces with extreme pose. Rather than scaling x to the parameter \alpha, Hasnat et al. [111] normalized features with \hat{x}=\frac{x-\mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^{2}}}, where \mu and \sigma^{2} are the mean and variance. Ring loss [117] encouraged the norm of samples being value R (a learned parameter) rather than explicit enforcing through a hard normalization operation. Moreover, normalizing both features and weights [110, 112, 115, 105, 106] has become a common strategy. Wang et al. [110] explained the necessity of this normalization operation from both analytic and geometric perspectives. After normalizing features and weights, CoCo loss [112] optimized the cosine distance among data features, and Hasnat et al. [115] used the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) mixture model as the theoretical basis to develop a novel vMF mixture loss and its corresponding vMF deep features.","Normalizing the weights only can help angular/cosine-margin-based loss to make the learned features more discriminative, whereas normalizing only the learned features can help overcome the bias to the sample distribution of the softmax. Since L2-norms of learned features with softmax loss were observed to be reflective of the quality of the face, making all the features have the same L2-norm may help to give similar attention to all different qualities of samples. Lastly, normalizing both the weights and features has become a common method since it was proven necessary by Wang et al. It is difficult to give more specific reasons why normalizing helps softmax loss, as most of the explanations come from referenced papers.","Sure! Here's my answer:

Batch normalization is a technique used in deep learning to improve the stability and performance of neural networks, particularly in image classification tasks. It normalizes the inputs to each layer, helping the network learn more robust features and improve generalization",0.1592920309342941,0.0,0.1415929158900463,0.917818551166978,29.838507765542527,25.517961536645345,0.0864304235090752,0.0040575433419402,0.4370541274547577,0.5279813993368453,0.3607255009313425,0.4373728036880493,0.0108818764380404,0.0,0.8290210558507045,0.8054416576584469
803,What are some common metrics used to evaluate the performance of face recognition systems?,"•We present a comparison and analysis on public available databases that are of vital importance for both model training and testing. Major FR benchmarks, such as LFW [23], IJB-A/B/C [41, 42, 43], Megaface [44], and MS-Celeb-1M [45], are reviewed and compared, in term of the four aspects: training methodology, evaluation tasks and metrics, and recognition scenes, which provides an useful reference for training and testing deep FR. In order to evaluate whether our deep models can solve the different problems of FR in real life, many testing datasets are designed to evaluate the models in different tasks, i.e. face verification, close-set face identification and open-set face identification. In either task, a set of known subjects is initially enrolled in the system (the gallery), and during testing, a new subject (the probe) is presented. Face verification computes one-to-one similarity between the gallery and probe to determine whether the two images are of the same subject, whereas face identification computes one-to-many similarity to determine the specific identity of a probe face. When the probe appears in the gallery identities, this is referred to as closed-set identification; when the probes include those who are not in the gallery, this is open-set identification. Face verification is relevant to access control systems, re-identification, and application independent evaluations of FR algorithms. It is classically measured using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and estimated mean accuracy (Acc). At a given threshold (the independent variable), ROC analysis measures the true accept rate (TAR), which is the fraction of genuine comparisons that correctly exceed the threshold, and the false accept rate (FAR), which is the fraction of impostor comparisons that incorrectly exceed the threshold. And Acc is a simplified metric introduced by LFW [23], which represents the percentage of correct classifications. With the development of deep FR, more accurate recognitions are required. Customers concern more about the TAR when FAR is kept in a very low rate in most security certification scenario. PaSC [179] reports TAR at a FAR of 10^{-2}; IJB-A [41] evaluates TAR at a FAR of 10^{-3}; Megaface [44, 164] focuses on TAR@10^{-6}FAR; especially, in MS-celeb-1M challenge 3 [163], TAR@10^{-9}FAR is reported. Close-set face identification is relevant to user driven searches (e.g., forensic identification), rank-N and cumulative match characteristic (CMC) is commonly used metrics in this scenario. Rank-N is based on what percentage of probe searches return the probe’s gallery mate within the top k rank-ordered results. The CMC curve reports the percentage of probes identified within a given rank (the independent variable). IJB-A/B/C [41, 42, 43] concern on the rank-1 and rank-5 recognition rate. The MegaFace challenge [44, 164] systematically evaluates rank-1 recognition rate function of increasing number of gallery distractors (going from 10 to 1 Million), the results of the SOTA evaluated on MegaFace challenge are listed in Table IX. Rather than rank-N and CMC, MS-Celeb-1M [45] further applies a precision-coverage curve to measure identification performance under a variable threshold t. The probe is rejected when its confidence score is lower than t. The algorithms are compared in term of what fraction of passed probes, i.e. coverage, with a high recognition precision, e.g. 95% or 99%, the results of the SOTA evaluated on MS-Celeb-1M challenge are listed in Table X. •Remaining challenges defined by non-saturated benchmark datasets. Three current major datasets, namely, MegaFace [44, 164] , MS-Celeb-1M [45] and IJB-A/B/C [41, 42, 43], are corresponding to large-scale FR with a very large number of candidates, low/one-shot FR and large pose-variance FR which will be the focus of research in the future. Although the SOTA algorithms can be over 99.9 percent accurate on LFW [23] and Megaface [44, 164] databases, fundamental challenges such as matching faces cross ages [181], poses [188], sensors, or styles still remain. For both datasets and algorithms, it is necessary to measure and address the racial/gender/age biases of deep FR in future research. •Pursuit of extreme accuracy and efficiency. Many killer-applications, such as watch-list surveillance or financial identity verification, require high matching accuracy at very low alarm rate, e.g. 10^{-9}. It is still a big challenge even with deep learning on massive training data. Meanwhile, deploying deep face recognition on mobile devices pursues the minimum size of feature representation and compressed deep network. It is of great significance for both industry and academic to explore this extreme face-recognition performance beyond human imagination. It is also exciting to constantly push the performance limits of the algorithm after it has already surpassed human. Open-set face identification is relevant to high throughput face search systems (e.g., de-duplication, watch list identification), where the recognition system should reject unknown/unseen subjects (probes who do not present in gallery) at test time. At present, there are very few databases covering the task of open-set FR. IJB-A/B/C [41], [42], [43] benchmarks introduce a decision error tradeoff (DET) curve to characterize the the false negative identification rate (FNIR) as function of the false positive identification rate (FPIR). FPIR measures what fraction of comparisons between probe templates and non-mate gallery templates result in a match score exceeding T . At the same time, FNIR measures what fraction of probe searches will fail to match a mated gallery template above a score of T . The algorithms are compared in term of the FNIR at a low FPIR, e.g. 1% or 10%, the results of the SOTA evaluated on IJB-A dataset as listed in Table XI.","Common metrics that are used to evaluate the accuracy of FR models are: ROC, Acc. for face verification; rank-N and CMC curve for closed-set face identification, and DET curve for open-set face identification. Also, the metrics for the complexity and size of FR models are important. Lastly, the metrics that measure the age/gender/racial bias of the FR models are becoming necessary.",The authors of the instructions were the authors of the paper,0.0909090882334711,0.0327868829669445,0.0909090882334711,1.2098538739077451,16.728443341426097,15.832743386593105,0.0655982905982905,0.0019960079840319,0.0590503737330436,0.4132226588342973,0.1591111570596695,0.1852874606847763,0.0079561972112866,0.5,0.6900978406140973,0.6949653466570702
804,"Can the methods of ""one-to-many augmentation"" like data augmentation and 3D face reconstruction effectively improve the performance of deep FR algorithms in terms of accuracy and diversity of training data?","Collecting a large database is extremely expensive and time consuming. The methods of “one-to-many augmentation” can mitigate the challenges of data collection, and they can be used to augment not only training data but also the gallery of test data. we categorized them into four classes: data augmentation, 3D model, autoencoder model and GAN model. Data augmentation. Common data augmentation methods consist of photometric transformations [75, 22] and geometric transformations, such as oversampling (multiple patches obtained by cropping at different scales) [22], mirroring [153], and rotating [154] the images. Recently, data augmentation has been widely used in deep FR algorithms [58, 59, 60, 35, 21, 36, 61, 62]. for example, Sun et al. [21] cropped 400 face patches varying in positions, scales, and color channels and mirrored the images. Liu et al. [58] generated seven overlapped image patches centered at different landmarks on the face region and trained them with seven CNNs with the same structure. 3D model. 3D face reconstruction is also a way to enrich the diversity of training data. They utilize 3D structure information to model the transformation between poses. 3D models first use 3D face data to obtain morphable displacement fields and then apply them to obtain 2D face data in different pose angles. There is a large number of papers about this domain, but we only focus on the 3D face reconstruction using deep methods or used for deep FR. In [47], Masi et al. generated face images with new intra-class facial appearance variations, including pose, shape and expression, and then trained a 19-layer VGGNet with both real and augmented data. Masi et al. [48] used generic 3D faces and rendered fixed views to reduce much of the computational effort. Richardson et al. [49] employed an iterative 3D CNN by using a secondary input channel to represent the previous network’s output as an image for reconstructing a 3D face as shown in Fig. 13. Dou et al. [51] used a multi-task CNN to divide 3D face reconstruction into neutral 3D reconstruction and expressive 3D reconstruction. Tran et al. [53] directly regressed 3D morphable face model (3DMM) [155] parameters from an input photo by a very deep CNN architecture. An et al. [156] synthesized face images with various poses and expressions using the 3DMM method, then reduced the gap between synthesized data and real data with the help of MMD. 2) Assembled Networks : Multi-input networks. In “one-to-many augmentation”, multiple images with variety are generated from one image in order to augment training data. Taken these multiple images as input, multiple networks are also assembled together to extract and combine features of different type of inputs, which can outperform an individual network. In [58], [59], [60], [99], [34], [21], [35], assembled networks are built after different face patches are cropped, and then different types of patches are fed into different sub-networks for representation extraction. By combining the results of subnetworks, the performance can be improved. Other papers [96], [95], [98] used assembled networks to recognize images. Autoencoder model. Rather than reconstructing 3D models from a 2D image and projecting it back into 2D images of different poses, autoencoder models can generate 2D target images directly. Taken a face image and a pose code encoding a target pose as input, an encoder first learns pose-invariant face representation, and then a decoder generates a face image with the same identity viewed at the target pose by using the pose-invariant representation and the pose code. For example, given the target pose codes, multi-view perceptron (MVP) [55] trained some deterministic hidden neurons to learn pose-invariant face representations, and simultaneously trained some random hidden neurons to capture pose features, then a decoder generated the target images by combining pose-invariant representations with pose features. As shown in Fig. 14, Yim et al. [157] and Qian et al. [158] introduced an auxiliary CNN to generate better images viewed at the target poses. First, an autoencoder generated the desired pose image, then the auxiliary CNN reconstructed the original input image back from the generated target image, which guarantees that the generated image is identity-preserving. In [65], two groups of units are embedded between encoder and decoder. The identity units remain unchanged and the rotation of images is achieved by taking actions to pose units at each time step. GAN model. In GAN models, a generator aims to fool a discriminator through generating images that resemble the real images, while the discriminator aims to discriminate the generated samples from the real ones. By this minimax game between generator and discriminator, GAN can successfully generate photo-realistic images with different poses. After using a 3D model to generate profile face images, DA-GAN [56] refined the images by a GAN, which combines prior knowledge of the data distribution and knowledge of faces (pose and identity perception loss). CVAE-GAN [159] combined a variational auto-encoder with a GAN for augmenting data, and took advantages of both statistic and pairwise feature matching to make the training process converge faster and more stably. In addition to synthesizing diverse faces from noise, some papers also explore to disentangle the identity and variation, and synthesize new faces by exchanging identity and variation from different people. In CG-GAN [160], a generator directly resolves each representation of input image into a variation code and an identity code and regroups these codes for cross-generating, simultaneously, a discriminator ensures the reality of generated images. Bao et al. [161] extracted identity representation of one input image and attribute representation of any other input face image, then synthesized new faces by recombining these representations. This work shows superior performance in generating realistic and identity preserving face images, even for identities outside the training dataset. Unlike previous methods that treat classifier as a spectator, FaceID-GAN [162] proposed a three-player GAN where the classifier cooperates together with the discriminator to compete with the generator from two different aspects, i.e. facial identity and image quality respectively.","In terms of accuracy, the paper mentions a set of work done on assembled multi-input networks that used ""one-to-many augmentation"" methods to expand their dataset and achieve better results compared to individual networks. In terms of diversity, all data augmentation, 3D face reconstruction, autoencoders, and especially GANs were found to be effective in generating faces in certain poses, angles, with different expressions, etc.","Yes, the lower bound estimator obtained by reparameterizing the variational lower bound is differentiable",0.0307692279573967,0.0,0.0307692279573967,0.9621613720042518,22.969438792111045,18.651009904395547,0.0217391304347826,0.0022529771483746,0.0758267641067504,0.4801359859316849,0.1134577691555023,0.3141592442989349,0.0042213518071826,0.6666666666666666,0.7632013115335271,0.7313559625953635
805,"How has the evolution of network architectures in deep face recognition systems, such as the transition from AlexNet to ResNet and SENet, impacted the performance of these systems?	","Mainstream architectures. The commonly used network architectures of deep FR have always followed those of deep object classification and evolved from AlexNet to SENet rapidly. We present the most influential architectures of deep object classification and deep face recognition in chronological order 111The time we present is when the paper was published. in Fig. 8.  With the evolved architectures and advanced training techniques, such as batch normalization (BN), the network becomes deeper and the training becomes more controllable. Following these architectures in object classification, the networks in deep FR are also developed step by step, and the performance of deep FR is continually improving. We present these mainstream architectures of deep FR in Fig. 9. In 2014, DeepFace [20] was the first to use a nine-layer CNN with several locally connected layers. With 3D alignment for face processing, it reaches an accuracy of 97.35% on LFW. In 2015, FaceNet [38] used a large private dataset to train a GoogleNet. It adopted a triplet loss function based on triplets of roughly aligned matching/nonmatching face patches generated by a novel online triplet mining method and achieved good performance of 99.63%. In the same year, VGGface [37] designed a procedure to collect a large-scale dataset from the Internet. It trained the VGGNet on this dataset and then fine-tuned the networks via a triplet loss function similar to FaceNet. VGGface obtains an accuracy of 98.95%. In 2017, SphereFace [84] used a 64-layer ResNet architecture and proposed the angular softmax (A-Softmax) loss to learn discriminative face features with angular margin. It boosts the achieves to 99.42% on LFW. In the end of 2017, a new large-scale face dataset, namely VGGface2 [39], was introduced, which consists of large variations in pose, age, illumination, ethnicity and profession. Cao et al. first trained a SENet with MS-celeb-1M dataset [45] and then fine-tuned the model with VGGface2 [39], and achieved the SOTA performance on the IJB-A [41] and IJB-B [42]. In 2014, DeepFace [20] achieved the SOTA accuracy on the famous LFW benchmark [23], approaching human performance on the unconstrained condition for the first time (DeepFace: 97.35% vs. Human: 97.53%), by training a 9-layer model on 4 million facial images. Inspired by this work, research focus has shifted to deep-learning-based approaches, and the accuracy was dramatically boosted to above 99.80% in just three years. Deep learning technique has reshaped the research landscape of FR in almost all aspects such as algorithm designs, training/test datasets, application scenarios and even the evaluation protocols. Therefore, it is of great significance to review the breakthrough and rapid development process in recent years. There have been several surveys on FR [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and its subdomains, and they mostly summarized and compared a diverse set of techniques related to a specific FR scene, such as illumination-invariant FR [29], 3D FR [28], pose-invariant FR [30][31]. Unfortunately, due to their earlier publication dates, none of them covered the deep learning methodology that is most successful nowadays. This survey focuses only on recognition problem, and one can refer to Ranjan et al. [32] for a brief review of a full deep FR pipeline with detection and alignment, or refer to Jin et al. [33] for a survey of face alignment. Specifically, the major contributions of this survey are as follows:","As deep FR models followed the footsteps of deep object classification network architectures the performance got better, training got more controllable, and models got deeper. It started with DeepFace which was based on AlexNet that achieved 97.35% on the LFW benchmark. Then came the FaceNet based on GoogleNet which achieved 99.63%. VGGFace with a procedure to collect the large-scale dataset on the web and using the VGGNet architecture reached 98.95%. SphereFace used ResNet to achieve 99.42% accuracy.

806,How do feature-based methods work in face recognition?,"Face recognition (FR) has been the prominent biometric technique for identity authentication and has been widely used in many areas, such as military, finance, public security and daily life. FR has been a long-standing research topic in the CVPR community. In the early 1990s, the study of FR became popular following the introduction of the historical Eigenface approach [1]. The milestones of feature-based FR over the past years are presented in Fig. 1, in which the times of four major technical streams are highlighted. The holistic approaches derive the low-dimensional representation through certain distribution assumptions, such as linear subspace [2][3][4], manifold [5][6][7], and sparse representation [8][9][10][11]. This idea dominated the FR community in the 1990s and 2000s. However, a well-known problem is that these theoretically plausible holistic methods fail to address the uncontrolled facial changes that deviate from their prior assumptions. In the early 2000s, this problem gave rise to local-feature-based FR. Gabor [12] and LBP [13], as well as their multilevel and high-dimensional extensions [14][15][16], achieved robust performance through some invariant properties of local filtering. Unfortunately, handcrafted features suffered from a lack of distinctiveness and compactness. In the early 2010s, learning-based local descriptors were introduced to the FR community [17][18][19], in which local filters are learned for better distinctiveness and the encoding codebook is learned for better compactness. However, these shallow representations still have an inevitable limitation on robustness against the complex nonlinear facial appearance variations.",The only feature-based method that is mentioned in the paper is the local-feature-based methods from the 2000s of Gabor and LBP that tried local filtering to extract invariant properties. But they were too rigid and lacked distinctiveness and compactness.,The method uses PatchGAN for its discriminator network because it has fewer parameters than a full-image discriminator and can work on arbitrarily-sized images in a fully convolutional fashion. This allows for more efficient training and better performance,0.1212121162121214,0.0,0.0909090859090911,1.4014248243844825,23.538051426724625,19.59879423161592,0.0737100737100737,0.0101732196865548,0.1659042686223983,0.4355536321843709,0.1061333790421485,0.5806229114532471,0.0173967196298762,0.0,0.7791510353796332,0.788646268144553
807,Can adaptive-architecture networks be used in other tasks besides face recognition?,"Adaptive-architecture networks. Considering that designing architectures manually by human experts are time-consuming and error-prone processes, there is growing interest in adaptive-architecture networks which can find well-performing architectures, e.g. the type of operation every layer executes (pooling, convolution, etc) and hyper-parameters associated with the operation (number of filters, kernel size and strides for a convolutional layer, etc), according to the specific requirements of training and testing data. Currently, neural architecture search (NAS) [130] is one of the promising methodologies, which has outperformed manually designed architectures on some tasks such as image classification [131] or semantic segmentation [132]. Zhu et al. [88] integrated NAS technology into face recognition. They used reinforcement learning [133] algorithm (policy gradient) to guide the controller network to train the optimal child architecture. Besides NAS, there are some other explorations to learn optimal architectures adaptively. For example, conditional convolutional neural network (c-CNN) [89] dynamically activated sets of kernels according to modalities of samples; Han et al. [90] proposed a novel contrastive convolution consisted of a trunk CNN and a kernel generator, which is beneficial owing to its dynamistic generation of contrastive kernels based on the pair of faces being compared.","Adaptive-architecture networks have been successfully applied to various tasks like image classification, semantic segmentation, and more.","Sure!

808,What are the main loss functions that have been explored for improving deep FR methods and how have they evolved over time?,"Inheriting from the object classification network such as AlexNet, the initial Deepface [20] and DeepID [34] adopted cross-entropy based softmax loss for feature learning. After that, people realized that the softmax loss is not sufficient by itself to learn discriminative features, and more researchers began to explore novel loss functions for enhanced generalization ability. This becomes the hottest research topic in deep FR research, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Before 2017, Euclidean-distance-based loss played an important role; In 2017, angular/cosine-margin-based loss as well as feature and weight normalization became popular. It should be noted that, although some loss functions share the similar basic idea, the new one is usually designed to facilitate the training procedure by easier parameter or sample selection. •A systematic review on the evolution of the network architectures and loss functions for deep FR is provided. Various loss functions are categorized into Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss and softmax loss and its variations. Both the mainstream network architectures, such as Deepface [20], DeepID series [34, 35, 21, 36], VGGFace [37], FaceNet [38], and VGGFace2 [39], and other architectures designed for FR are covered. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of deep FR from both data and algorithm aspects. For algorithms, mainstream and special network architectures are presented. Meanwhile, we categorize loss functions into Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss and variable softmax loss. For data, we summarize some commonly used datasets. Moreover, the methods of face processing are introduced and categorized as “one-to-many augmentation” and “many-to-one normalization”. Finally, the special scenes of deep FR, including video FR, 3D FR and cross-age FR, are briefly introduced. 1) Euclidean-distance-based Loss : Euclidean-distance-based loss is a metric learning method [118], [119] that embeds images into Euclidean space in which intra-variance is reduced and inter-variance is enlarged. The contrastive loss and the triplet loss are the commonly used loss functions. The contrastive loss [35], [21], [36], [61], [120] requires face image pairs, and then pulls together positive pairs and pushes apart negative pairs. L =yij max (0, ‖f (xi) − f (xj )‖2 − +) + (1 − yij )max (0, − − ‖f (xi) − f (xj )‖2 ) (2) where yij = 1 means xi and xj are matching samples and yij = 0 means non-matching samples. f (·) is the feature embedding, + and − control the margins of the matching and non-matching pairs respectively. DeepID2 [21] combined the face identification (softmax) and verification (contrastive loss) supervisory signals to learn a discriminative representation, and joint Bayesian (JB) was applied to obtain a robust embedding space. Extending from DeepID2 [21], DeepID2+ [35] increased the dimension of hidden representations and added supervision to early convolutional layers. DeepID3 [36] further introduced VGGNet and GoogleNet to their work. However, the main problem with the contrastive loss is that the margin parameters are often difficult to choose. Contrary to contrastive loss that considers the absolute distances of the matching pairs and non-matching pairs, triplet loss considers the relative difference of the distances between them. Along with FaceNet [38] proposed by Google, Triplet loss [38], [37], [81], [80], [58], [60] was introduced into FR. It requires the face triplets, and then it minimizes the distance between an anchor and a positive sample of the same identity and maximizes the distance between the anchor and a negative sample of a different identity. FaceNet made ‖f (xa i ) − f (xp i )‖2 2 + α < − ‖f (xa i ) − f (xn i )‖2 2 using hard triplet face samples, where xa i , xp i and xn i are the anchor, positive and negative samples, respectively, α is a margin and f (·) represents a nonlinear transformation embedding an image into a feature space. Inspired by FaceNet [38], TPE [81] and TSE [80] learned a linear projection W to construct triplet loss. Other methods optimize deep models using both triplet loss and softmax loss [59], [58], [60], [121]. They first train networks with softmax and then fine-tune them with triplet loss. However, the contrastive loss and triplet loss occasionally encounter training instability due to the selection of effective training samples, some paper begun to explore simple alternatives. Center loss [101] and its variants [82], [116], [102] are good choices for reducing intra-variance. The center loss [101] learned a center for each class and penalized the distances between the deep features and their corresponding class centers. This loss can be defined as follows: LC = 1 2 m∑ i=1 ‖xi − cyi ‖2 2 (3) where xi denotes the i-th deep feature belonging to the yi-th class and cyi denotes the yi-th class center of deep features. To handle the long-tailed data, a range loss [82], which is a variant of center loss, is used to minimize k greatest range’s harmonic mean values in one class and maximize the shortest interclass distance within one batch. Wu et al. [102] proposed a center-invariant loss that penalizes the difference between each center of classes. Deng et al. [116] selected the farthest intraclass samples and the nearest inter-class samples to compute a margin loss. However, the center loss and its variants suffer from massive GPU memory consumption on the classification layer, and prefer balanced and sufficient training data for each identity. 2) Angular/cosine-margin-based Loss : In 2017, people had a deeper understanding of loss function in deep FR and thought that samples should be separated more strictly to avoid misclassifying the difficult samples. Angular/cosine-margin-based loss [104], [84], [105], [106], [108] is proposed to make learned features potentially separable with a larger angular/cosine distance. The decision boundary in softmax loss is (W1 − W2) x + b1 − b2 = 0, where x is feature vector, Wi and bi are weights and bias in softmax loss, respectively. Liu et al. [104] reformulated the original softmax loss into a large-margin softmax (L-Softmax) loss. They constrain b1 = b2 = 0, so the decision boundaries for class 1 and class 2 become ‖x‖ (‖W1‖ cos (mθ1) − ‖W2‖ cos (θ2)) = 0 and ‖x‖ (‖W1‖ ‖W2‖ cos (θ1) − cos (mθ2)) = 0, respectively, where m is a positive integer introducing an angular margin, and θi is the angle between Wi and x. Due to the nonmonotonicity of the cosine function, a piece-wise function is applied in L-softmax to guarantee the monotonicity. The loss function is defined as follows: Li = −log ( e‖Wyi‖‖xi‖φ(θyi) e‖Wyi‖‖xi‖φ(θyi)+∑ j6 =yi e‖Wyi‖‖xi‖cos(θj ) ) (4) where φ(θ) = (−1)kcos(mθ) − 2k, θ ∈ [ kπ m , (k + 1)π m ] (5) Considering that L-Softmax is difficult to converge, it is always combined with softmax loss to facilitate and ensure the convergence. Therefore, the loss function is changed into: fyi = λ‖Wyi ‖‖xi‖cos(θyi )+‖Wyi ‖‖xi‖φ(θyi ) 1+λ , where λ is a dynamic hyper-parameter. Based on L-Softmax, A-Softmax loss [84] further normalized the weight W by L2 norm (‖W ‖ = 1) such that the normalized vector will lie on a hypersphere, and then the discriminative face features can be learned on a hypersphere manifold with an angular margin (Fig. 6). Liu et al. [108] introduced a deep hyperspherical convolution network (SphereNet) that adopts hyperspherical convolution as its basic convolution operator and is supervised by angular-margin-based loss. To overcome the optimization difficulty of L-Softmax and A-Softmax, which incorporate the angular margin in a multiplicative manner, ArcFace [106] and CosFace [105], AMS loss [107] respectively introduced an additive angular/cosine margin cos(θ + m) and cosθ − m. They are extremely easy to implement without tricky hyperparameters λ, and are more clear and able to converge without the softmax supervision. The decision boundaries under the binary classification case are given in Table V. Based on large margin, FairLoss [122] and AdaptiveFace [123] further proposed to adjust the margins for different classes adaptively to address the problem of unbalanced data. Compared to Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss explicitly adds discriminative constraints on a hypershpere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that human face lies on a manifold. However, Wang et al. [124] showed that angular/cosine-margin-based loss can achieve better results on a clean dataset, but is vulnerable to noise and becomes worse than center loss and softmax in the high-noise region as shown in Fig. 7. 3) Softmax Loss and its Variations : In 2017, in addition to reformulating softmax loss into an angular/cosine-margin-based loss as mentioned above, some works tries to normalize the features and weights in loss functions to improve the model performance, which can be written as follows: ˆW = W ‖W ‖ , ˆx = α x ‖x‖ (6) where α is a scaling parameter, x is the learned feature vector, W is weight of last fully connected layer. Scaling x to a fixed radius α is important, as Wang et al. [110] proved that normalizing both features and weights to 1 will make the softmax loss become trapped at a very high value on the training set. After that, the loss function, e.g. softmax, can be performed using the normalized features and weights. Some papers [84], [108] first normalized the weights only and then added angular/cosine margin into loss functions to make the learned features be discriminative. In contrast, some works, such as [109], [111], adopted feature normalization only to overcome the bias to the sample distribution of the softmax. Based on the observation of [125] that the L2-norm of features learned using the softmax loss is informative of the quality of the face, L2-softmax [109] enforced all the features to have the same L2-norm by feature normalization such that similar attention is given to good quality frontal faces and blurry faces with extreme pose. Rather than scaling x to the parameter α, Hasnat et al. [111] normalized features with ˆx = x−μ√σ2 , where μ and σ2 are the mean and variance. Ring loss [117] encouraged the norm of samples being value R (a learned parameter) rather than explicit enforcing through a hard normalization operation. Moreover, normalizing both features and weights [110], [112], [115], [105], [106] has become a common strategy. Wang et al. [110] explained the necessity of this normalization operation from both analytic and geometric perspectives. After normalizing features and weights, CoCo loss [112] optimized the cosine distance among data features, and Hasnat et al. [115] used the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) mixture model as the theoretical basis to develop a novel vMF mixture loss and its corresponding vMF deep features.","There are 3 categories of loss functions for FR: Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss, and softmax loss variations. Initially, cross-entropy softmax loss was used, then some models tried using Euclidean-distance-based loss functions which started from contrastive loss and triplet loss. However, due to their instability, the center loss and its variants (range loss, center-invariant loss) were introduced. With a better understanding of loss functions for FR angular/cosine-margin-based loss functions were used. It began with a reformulation of a softmax loss called L-Softmax, later A-Softmax appeared which adopted the L-Softmax idea but tried normalizing the weights. Afterward, there were several improvements such as ArcFace, CosFace, and AMS which facilitated the convergence, while Fairloss and AdaptiveFace dealt with unbalanced data. Lastly, there are different variations of softmax that try to normalize the L2-norms (L2-softmax, Ring loss), the weights, the features, or both weights and features (CoCo loss and vMF mixture loss).",Yes,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5347867321976713,0.4010900491482534,0.0,6.756300249983109e-05,-0.0584513209760189,0.3305523097515106,0.0364313386380672,,0.0005310979660633,,0.8989805249242283,0.7109955251292168
809,What are some of the specific challenges that FR models face in real-world applications and how have researchers attempted to address these challenges through the design of specialized algorithms?	,"Despite the high accuracy in the LFW [23] and Megaface [44, 164] benchmarks, the performance of FR models still hardly meets the requirements in real-world application. A conjecture in industry is made that results of generic deep models can be improved simply by collecting big datasets of the target scene. However, this holds only to a certain degree. More and more concerns on privacy may make the collection and human-annotation of face data become illegal in the future. Therefore, significant efforts have been paid to design excellent algorithms to address the specific problems with limited data in these realistic scenes. In this section, we present several special algorithms of FR. With the emergence of mobile phones, tablets and augmented reality, FR has been applied in mobile devices. Due to computational limitations, the recognition tasks in these devices need to be carried out in a light but timely fashion. MobiFace [87] required efficient memory and low cost operators by adopting fast downsampling and bottleneck residual block, and achieves99.7% on LFW database and 91.3% on Megaface database. Tadmor et al. [263] proposed a multibatch method that first generates signatures for a minibatch of k face images and then constructs an unbiased estimate of the full gradient by relying on all k^{2}-k pairs from the minibatch. As mentioned in Section 3.2.1, light-weight deep networks [126, 127, 128, 129] perform excellently in the fundamental tasks of image classification and deserve further attention in FR tasks. Moreover, some well-known compressed networks such as Pruning [264, 265, 266], BinaryNets [267, 268, 269, 270], Mimic Networks [271, 272], also have potential to be introduced into FR. 1) Cross-Pose Face Recognition: As [182] shows that many existing algorithms suffer a decrease of over 10% from frontal-frontal to frontal-profile verification, cross-pose FR is still an extremely challenging scene. In addition to the aforementioned methods, including “one-to-many augmentation”, “many-to-one normalization” and assembled networks (Section IV and III-B.2), there are some other algorithms designed for cross-pose FR. Considering the extra burden of above methods, Cao et al. [215] attempted to perform frontalization in the deep feature space rather than the image space. A deep residual equivariant mapping (DREAM) block dynamically added residuals to an input representation to transform a profile face to a frontal image. Chen et al. [216] proposed to combine feature extraction with multi-view subspace learning to simultaneously make features be more pose-robust and discriminative. Pose Invariant Model (PIM) [217] jointly performed face frontalization and learned pose invariant representations end-to-end to allow them to mutually boost each other, and further introduced unsupervised cross-domain adversarial training and a learning to learn strategy to provide high-fidelity frontal reference face images. 2) Cross-Age Face Recognition: Cross-age FR is extremely challenging due to the changes in facial appearance by the aging process over time. One direct approach is to synthesize the desired image with target age such that the recognition can be performed in the same age group. A generative probabilistic model was used by [218] to model the facial aging process at each short-term stage. The identity-preserved conditional generative adversarial networks (IPCGANs) [219] framework utilized a conditional-GAN to generate a face in which an identity-preserved module preserved the identity information and an age classifier forced the generated face with the target age. Antipov et al. [220] proposed to age faces by GAN, but the synthetic faces cannot be directly used for face verification due to its imperfect preservation of identities. Then, they used a local manifold adaptation (LMA) approach [221] to solve the problem of [220]. In [222], high-level age-specific features conveyed by the synthesized face are estimated by a pyramidal adversarial discriminator at multiple scales to generate more lifelike facial details. An alternative to address the cross-age problem is to decompose aging and identity components separately and extract age-invariant representations. Wen et al. [192] developed a latent identity analysis (LIA) layer to separate these two components, as shown in Fig. 22. In [193], age-invariant features were obtained by subtracting age-specific factors from the representations with the help of the age estimation task. In [124], face features are decomposed in the spherical coordinate system, in which the identity-related components are represented with angular coordinates and the age-related information is encoded with radial coordinate. Additionally, there are other methods designed for cross-age FR. For example, Bianco ett al. [223] and El et al. [224] fine-tuned the CNN to transfer knowledge across age. Wang et al. [225] proposed a siamese deep network to perform multi-task learning of FR and age estimation. Li et al. [226] integrated feature extraction and metric learning via a deep CNN. 3) Makeup Face Recognition: Makeup is widely used by the public today, but it also brings challenges for FR due to significant facial appearance changes. The research on matching makeup and nonmakeup face images is receiving increasing attention. Li et al. [208] generated nonmakeup images from makeup ones by a bi-level adversarial network (BLAN) and then used the synthesized nonmakeup images for verification as shown in Fig. 23. Sun et al. [227] pretrained a triplet network on videos and fine-tuned it on a small makeup datasets. Specially, facial disguise [214], [228], [229] is a challenging research topic in makeup face recognition. By using disguise accessories such as wigs, beard, hats, mustache, and heavy makeup, disguise introduces two variations: (i) when a person wants to obfuscate his/her own identity, and (ii) another individual impersonates someone else’s identity. Obfuscation increases intra-class variations whereas impersonation reduces the inter-class dissimilarity, thereby affecting face recognition/verification task. To address this issue, a variety of methods are proposed. Zhang et al. [230] first trained two DCNNs for generic face recognition and then used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to find the transformation matrix for disguised face recognition adaptation. Kohli et al. [231] finetuned models using disguised faces. Smirnov et al. [232] proposed a hard example mining method benefitted from class-wise (Doppelganger Mining [233]) and example-wise mining to learn useful deep embeddings for disguised face recognition. Suri et al. [234] learned the representations of images in terms of colors, shapes, and textures (COST) using an unsupervised dictionary learning method, and utilized the combination of COST features and CNN features to perform recognition. 1) NIR-VIS Face Recognition: Due to the excellent performance of the near-infrared spectrum (NIS) images under low-light scenarios, NIS images are widely applied in surveillance systems. Because most enrolled databases consist of visible light (VIS) spectrum images, how to recognize a NIR face from a gallery of VIS images has been a hot topic. Saxena et al. [235] and Liu et al. [236] transferred the VIS deep networks to the NIR domain by fine-tuning. Lezama et al. [237] used a VIS CNN to recognize NIR faces by transforming NIR images to VIS faces through cross-spectral hallucination and restoring a low-rank structure for features through low-rank embedding. Reale et al. [198] trained a VISNet (for visible images) and a NIRNet (for near-infrared images), and coupled their output features by creating a siamese network. He et al. [238], [239] divided the high layer of the network into a NIR layer, a VIS layer and a NIR-VIS shared layer, then, a modality-invariant feature can be learned by the NIR-VIS shared layer. Song et al. [240] embedded cross-spectral face hallucination and discriminative feature learning into an end-to-end adversarial network. In [196], the low-rank relevance and cross-modal ranking were used to alleviate the semantic gap. 2) Low-Resolution Face Recognition: Although deep networks are robust to low resolution to a great extent, there are still a few studies focused on promoting the performance of low-resolution FR. For example, Zangeneh et al. [241] proposed a CNN with a two-branch architecture (a super-resolution network and a feature extraction network) to map the high and low-resolution face images into a common space where the intra-person distance is smaller than the interperson distance. Shen et al. [242] exploited the face semantic information and local structural constraints to better restore the shape and detail of face images. In addition, they optimized the network with perceptual and adversarial losses to produce photo-realistic results. 3) Photo-Sketch Face Recognition: The photo-sketch FR may help law enforcement to quickly identify suspects. The commonly used methods can be categorized as two classes. One is to utilize transfer learning to directly match photos to sketches. Deep networks are first trained using a large face database of photos and are then fine-tuned using small sketch database [243], [244]. The other is to use the image-to-image translation, where the photo can be transformed to a sketch or the sketch to a photo; then, FR can be performed in one domain. Zhang et al. [200] developed a fully convolutional network with generative loss and a discriminative regularizer to transform photos to sketches. Zhang et al. [245] utilized a branched fully convolutional neural network (BFCN) to generate a structure-preserved sketch and a texture-preserved sketch, and then they fused them together via a probabilistic method. Recently, GANs have achieved impressive results in image generation. Yi et al. [246], Kim et al. [247] and Zhu et al. [248] used two generators, GA and GB , to generate sketches from photos and photos from sketches, respectively (Fig. 24). Based on [248], Wang et al. [202] proposed a multi-adversarial network to avoid artifacts by leveraging the implicit presence of feature maps of different resolutions in the generator subnetwork. Similar to photo-sketch FR, photocaricature FR is one kind of heterogenous FR scenes which is challenging and important to understanding of face perception. Huo et al. [213] built a large dataset of caricatures and photos, and provided several evaluation protocols and their baseline performances for comparison. 1) Low-Shot Face Recognition: For many practical applications, such as surveillance and security, the FR system should recognize persons with a very limited number of training samples or even with only one sample. The methods of low-shot learning can be categorized as 1) synthesizing training data and 2) learning more powerful features. Hong et al. [249] generated images in various poses using a 3D face model and adopted deep domain adaptation to handle other variations, such as blur, occlusion, and expression (Fig. 25). Choe et al. [250] used data augmentation methods and a GAN for pose transition and attribute boosting to increase the size of the training dataset. Wu et al. [176] proposed a framework with hybrid classifiers using a CNN and a nearest neighbor (NN) model. Guo et al. [143] made the norms of the weight vectors of the one-shot classes and the normal classes aligned to address the data imbalance problem. Cheng et al. [137] proposed an enforced softmax that contains optimal dropout, selective attenuation, L2 normalization and model-level optimization. Yin et al. [251] augmented feature space of low-shot classes by transferring the principal components from regular to low-shot classes to encourage the variance of low-shot classes to mimic that of regular classes. 2) Set/Template-Based Face Recognition: Different from traditional image-to-image recognition, set-to-set recognition takes a set (heterogeneous contents containing both images and videos) as the smallest unit of representation. This kind of setting does reflect the real-world biometric scenarios, thereby attracting a lot of attention. After learning face representations of media in each set, two strategies are generally adopted to perform set-to-set matching. One is to use these representations to perform pair-wise similarity comparison of two sets and aggregate the results into a single and final score by max score pooling [96], average score pooling [252] and its variations [253], [254]. The other strategy is feature pooling [96], [103], [81] which first aggregates face representations into a single representation for each set and then performs a comparison between two sets. In addition to the commonly used strategies, there are also some novel methods proposed for set/template-based FR. For example, Hayat et al. [255] proposed a deep heterogeneous feature fusion network to exploit the features’ complementary information generated by different CNNs. Liu et al. [256] introduced the actor-critic reinforcement learning for set-based FR. They casted the inner-set dependency modeling to a Markov decision process in the latent space, and trained a dependency-aware attention control agent to make attention control for each image in each step. 3) Video Face Recognition: There are two key issues in video FR: one is to integrate the information across different frames together to build a representation of the video face, and the other is to handle video frames with severe blur, pose variations, and occlusions. For frame aggregation, Yang et al. [83] proposed a neural aggregation network (NAN) in which the aggregation module, consisting of two attention blocks driven by a memory, produces a 128-dimensional vector representation (Fig. 26). Rao et al. [187] aggregated raw video frames directly by combining the idea of metric learning and adversarial learning. For dealing with bad frames, Rao et al. [185] discarded the bad frames by treating this operation as a Markov decision process and trained the attention model through a deep reinforcement learning framework. Ding et al. [257] artificially blurred clear images for training to learn blur-robust face representations. Parchami et al. [258] used a CNN to reconstruct a lower-quality video into a high-quality face. 1) 3D Face Recognition: 3D FR has inherent advantages over 2D methods, but 3D deep FR is not well developed due to the lack of large annotated 3D data. To enlarge 3D training datasets, most works use the methods of “one-to-many augmentation” to synthesize 3D faces. However, the effective methods for extracting deep features of 3D faces remain to be explored. Kim et al. [204] fine-tuned a 2D CNN with a small amount of 3D scans for 3D FR. Zulqarnain et al. [259] used a three-channel (corresponding to depth, azimuth and elevation angles of the normal vector) image as input and minimized the average prediction log-loss. Zhang et al. [260] first selected 30 feature points from the Candide-3 face model to characterize aces, then conducted the unsupervised pretraining of face depth data, and finally performed the supervised fine-tuning. 2) Partial Face Recognition: Partial FR, in which only arbitrary-size face patches are presented, has become an emerging problem with increasing requirements of identification from CCTV cameras and embedded vision systems in mobile devices, robots and smart home facilities. He et al. [261] divided the aligned face image into several multi-scale patches, and the dissimilarity between two partial face images is calculated as the weighted L2 distance between corresponding patches. Dynamic feature matching (DFM) [262] utilized a sliding window of the same size as the probe feature maps to decompose the gallery feature maps into several gallery sub-feature maps, and the similarity-guided constraint imposed on sparse representation classification (SRC) provides an alignment-free matching. 4) Face Anti-attack: With the success of FR techniques, various types of attacks, such as face spoofing and adversarial perturbations, are becoming large threats. Face spoofing involves presenting a fake face to the biometric sensor using a printed photograph, worn mask, or even an image displayed on another electronic device. In order to defense this type of attack, several methods are proposed [211], [273], [274], [275], [276], [277], [278], [279]. Atoum et al. [211] proposed a novel two-stream CNN in which the local features discriminate the spoof patches that are independent of the spatial face areas, and holistic depth maps ensure that the input live sample has a face-like depth. Yang et al. [273] trained a CNN using both a single frame and multiple frames with five scales as input, and using the live/spoof label as the output. Taken the sequence of video frames as input, Xu et al. [274] applied LSTM units on top of CNN to obtain end-to-end features to recognize spoofing faces which leveraged the local and dense property from convolution operation and learned the temporal structure using LSTM units. Li et al. [275] and Patel et al. [276] fine-tuned their networks from a pretrained model by training sets of real and fake images. Jourabloo et al. [277] proposed to inversely decompose a spoof face into the live face and the spoof noise pattern. Adversarial perturbation is the other type of attack which can be defined as the addition of a minimal vector r such that with addition of this vector into the input image x, i.e. (x + r), the deep learning models misclassifies the input while people will not. Recently, more and more work has begun to focus on solving this perturbation of FR. Goswami et al. [280] proposed to detect adversarial samples by characterizing abnormal filter response behavior in the hidden layers and increase the network’s robustness by removing the most problematic filters. Goel et al. [281] provided an open source implementation of adversarial detection and mitigation algorithms. Despite of progresses of anti-attack algorithms, attack methods are updated as well and remind us the need to further increase security and robustness in FR systems, for example, Mai et al. [282] proposed a neighborly deconvolutional neural network (NbNet) to reconstruct a fake face using the stolen deep templates. 5) Debiasing face recognition: As described in Section V-A, existing datasets are highly biased in terms of the distribution of demographic cohorts, which may dramatically impact the fairness of deep models. To address this issue, there are some works that seek to introduce fairness into face recognition and mitigate demographic bias, e,g. unbalanced-training [283], attribute removal [284], [285], [286] and domain adaptation [173], [287], [147]. 1) Unbalanced-training methods mitigate the bias via model regularization, taking into consideration of the fairness goal in the overall model objective function. For example, RL-RBN [283] formulated the process of finding the optimal margins for non-Caucasians as a Markov decision process and employed deep Q-learning to learn policies based on large margin loss. 2) Attribute removal methods confound or remove demographic information of faces to learn attribute-invariant representations. For example, Alvi et al. [284] applied a confusion loss to make a classifier fail to distinguish attributes of examples so that multiple spurious variations are removed from the feature representation. SensitiveNets [288] proposed to introduce sensitive information into triplet loss. They minimized the sensitive information, while maintaining distances between positive and negative embeddings. 3) Domain adaptation methods propose to investigate data bias problem from a domain adaptation point of view and attempt to design domain-invariant feature representations to mitigate bias across domains. IMAN [173] simultaneously aligned global distribution to decrease race gap at domain-level, and learned the discriminative target representations at cluster level. Kan [147] directly converted the Caucasian data to non-Caucasian domain in the image space with the help of sparse reconstruction coefficients learnt in the common subspace.","Cross-pose FR is still a challenging problem for existing algorithms and over 10% decrease in accuracy was observed in frontal-frontal to frontal-profile verification. Techniques like DREAM and PIM were employed to perform frontalization in the deep face and learn pose-invariant representations. Cross-age FR is also a natural problem as facial appearance changes over time. There were attempts to synthesize images from the same age group with a generative probabilistic model and conditional GANs were used to generate an identity-preserved face with a target age. Further, local manifold adaptation (LMA) and pyramidal adversarial discriminator approaches were tried to deal with the imperfect preservation of identities of GAN-synthesized images. Alternatively, decomposing the identity and age from each other was another direction. Latent identity analysis (LIA) and decomposing in a spherical coordinate system are some methods from that direction. Lastly, CNN fine-tuning, siamese deep network, feature extraction, and deep learning with CNN were some of the notable approaches. Makeup FR is another real-world problem that needs a solution, as makeup can drastically change the appearance of the subject. Bi-level adversarial network (BLAN) was used to generate non makeup images from makeup images. Fine-tuning the triplet network with a small makeup dataset was another try. In particular, facial disguise is a big issue for FR as people can either want to hide their identity or impersonate another one. Identity hiding increases intra-class variation, while impersonation decreases inter-class distinction. Using DCNN and finding the transformation matrix with PCA for face disguise, fine-tuning models with disguised faces, hard example mining, and learning the representation of images in colors, shapes, and textures are some of the attempts to solve the issue. NIR-VIS FR is needed to match the NIS images, (near-infrared spectrum) that usually come from surveillance contexts to VIS (visible light spectrum) images, as most of the available datasets contain VIS images. Transferring from VIS to NIR with fine-tuning, transforming NIR images to VIS with CNN, using the siamese network for each VIS and NIR respectively, dividing the network into NIR, VIS, and NIR-VIS layers to learn modality-invariant features, embedding cross-spectral face hallucination and discriminative features, and low-rank relevance and cross-modal ranking are some of the methods that were used to solve the issue. Low-resolution FR needs addressing, although deep models are mostly robust to such cases. Mapping low and high-resolution faces into the same space with CNN, using face semantic information and local structural constraints to restore the shape and detail of the images are notable approaches in this direction. Photo-sketch FR can help find suspects effectively. Approaches usually either use transfer learning to directly match photos to sketches or perform image-to-image translation (image to sketch or sketch to an image). For the first type, training with images of faces and fine-tuning with sketches is one of the attempts. For the second type, branched fully convolution network (BFCN) and lately, GAN architectures were used to translate the image to sketch or vice versa. In many real-world scenarios low-shot FR is needed where only a few data points are available. Researchers tried to either synthesize more data or learn more meaningful features. 3D models, GANs, data augmentation, hybrid classifiers, and normalization are some of the attempts that were found useful. Using not only a single image but a set of data as the smallest unit matches many of the biometric scenarios. There are 2 types of methods in set/template-based FR, either processing all the data in the set separately to find the matching score by combining the individual scores with a certain function or doing feature pooling which generates a single representation of the set and compares only them. Additionally, a deep heterogeneous feature fusion network and actor-critic reinforcement learning are some of the alternative attempts to deal with sets/templates. Video FR is also a complex problem consisting of combining the data across frames and handling individual frames with blur, pose variations, and occlusions. A neural aggregation network (NAN), combining metric and adversarial learning is some of the attempts to aggregate the frames. To deal with bad frames: deep reinforcement learning, learning blur-robust representations, and reconstruction of frames with CNN was tried. 3D FR is underdeveloped due to a lack of good datasets. Despite attempts to enlarge such datasets with 3D reconstruction from 2D images, using 2D CNN, and using 3-channel inputs, the direction is still open for exploration. Partial Face Recognition is emerging in several real-world scenarios where a decision should be made with only a part of the face available. Dividing the aligned image into multi-scale patches and Dynamic Feature Matching (DFM) are some of the approaches for Partial FR. Applying FR in mobile devices is an important problem that needs a solution under stricter conditions. Deep models like MobiFace and the multi-batch method are some of the work in this direction. However, the light networks and compressing methods as in image classification still need exploration in the FR context. Face Anti-attack systems are needed to defend from face spoofing, adversarial perturbations, etc. For face spoofing, ensuring face-like depth with two-stream CNN, classification with CNN, and LSTM for sequences of frames were tried to resolve the issue. In terms of adversarial perturbation, detecting abnormal layers of the network to increase the robustness of the model was an idea. However, the attack methods evolve as well, thus continued work in this direction is necessary. Highly biased FR datasets impose fairness issues on FR models. Thus, debiasing attempts are made by unbalanced training, attribute removal, and domain adaptation. Unbalanced training, for example, RL-RBN,  tries to remove the bias of the model by regularization (i.e adjusting the objective function). The attribute-removal method tries to learn attribute-invariant representations by removing demographic information. Lastly, domain adaptation attempts to learn domain-invariant representations to avoid any domain bias.","Yes, GMPool can be used with more recent GNN architectures such as GIN and Graph Transformers. While the paper only demonstrates the effectiveness of GMPool with DMPNN, the module-agnostic design of GMPool allows for its seamless integration with other GNN architectures. In fact, the authors mention that GMPool can be used with any GNN architecture as long as the architecture returns node representations as output. Therefore, it is possible to leverage more recent GNN architectures like GIN and Graph Transformers with GMPool to further improve the performance of graph pooling",0.0881763507128084,0.0021691958661743,0.0841683346807442,0.2029679048761598,16.97028776347563,14.949768230843786,0.0284177407896072,0.0009647336263265,0.1841152906417846,0.5419861671954894,0.3262652978301048,0.221089169383049,,1.0,0.750341786272349,0.7584580395076959
810,Is the segmented training data 2d or 3d ?,"Segmentation is a highly relevant task in medical image analysis.Automatic delineation of organs and structures of interest is often necessary to perform tasks such as visual augmentation [10], computer assisted diagnosis [12], interventions [20] and extraction of quantitative indices from images [1].In particular, since diagnostic and interventional imagery often consists of 3D images, being able to perform volumetric segmentations by taking into account the whole volume content at once, has a particular relevance.In this work, we aim to segment prostate MRI volumes. This is a challenging task due to the wide range of appearance the prostate can assume in different scans due to deformations and variations of the intensity distribution. Moreover, MRI volumes are often affected by artefacts and distortions due to field inhomogeneity. Prostate segmentation is nevertheless an important task having clinical relevance both during diagnosis, where the volume of the prostate needs to be assessed [13], and during treatment planning, where the estimate of the anatomical boundary needs to be accurate [4, 20]. Our CNN is trained end-to-end on a dataset of prostate scans in MRI. An example of the typical content of such volumes is shown in Figure 1. All the volumes processed by the network have fixed size of 128\times 128\times 64 voxels and a spatial resolution of 1\times 1\times 1.5 millimeters. We trained our method on 50 MRI volumes, and the relative manual ground truth annotation, obtained from the ”PROMISE2012” challenge dataset [7]. This dataset contains medical data acquired in different hospitals, using different equipment and different acquisition protocols. The data in this dataset is representative of the clinical variability and challenges encountered in clinical settings. As previously stated we massively augmented this dataset through random transformation performed in each training iteration, for each mini-batch fed to the network. The mini-batches used in our implementation contained two volumes each, mainly due to the high memory requirement of the model during training. We used a momentum of 0.99 and a initial learning rate of 0.0001 which decreases by one order of magnitude every 25K iterations. We tested V-Net on 30 MRI volumes depicting prostate whose ground truth annotation was secret. All the results reported in this section of the paper were obtained directly from the organisers of the challenge after submitting the segmentation obtained through our approach. The test set was representative of the clinical variability encountered in prostate scans in real clinical settings [7]. We presented and approach based on a volumetric convolutional neural network that performs segmentation of MRI prostate volumes in a fast and accurate manner. We introduced a novel objective function that we optimise during training based on the Dice overlap coefficient between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth annotation. Our Dice loss layer does not need sample re-weighting when the amount of background and foreground pixels is strongly unbalanced and is indicated for binary segmentation tasks. Although we inspired our architecture to the one proposed in [14], we divided it into stages that learn residuals and, as empirically observed, improve both results and convergence time. Future works will aim at segmenting volumes containing multiple regions in other modalities such as ultrasound and at higher resolutions by splitting the network over multiple GPUs. Fully convolutional network trained end-to-end were so far applied only to 2D images both in computer vision [11, 8] and microscopy image analysis [14]. These models, which served as an inspiration for our work, employed different network architectures and were trained to predict a segmentation mask, delineating the structures of interest, for the whole image. In [11] a pre-trained VGG network architecture [15] was used in conjunction with its mirrored, de-convolutional, equivalent to segment RGB images by leveraging the descriptive power of the features extracted by the innermost layer. In [8] three fully convolutional deep neural networks, pre-trained on a classification task, were refined to produce segmentations while in [14] a brand new CNN model, especially tailored to tackle biomedical image analysis problems in 2D, was proposed. In this work we present our approach to medical image segmentation that leverages the power of a fully convolutional neural networks, trained end-to-end, to process MRI volumes.Differently from other recent approaches we refrain from processing the input volumes slice-wise and we propose to use volumetric convolutions instead. We propose a novel objective function based on Dice coefficient maximisation, that we optimise during training.We demonstrate fast and accurate results on prostate MRI test volumes and we provide direct comparison with other methods which were evaluated on the same test data 111Detailed results available on http://promise12.grand-challenge.org/results/.",V-Net is trained on the 3D MRI prostate volumes.,"Sure!

811,What is the difference between foreground and background voxels?,"The right portion of the network extracts features and expands the spatial support of the lower resolution feature maps in order to gather and assemble the necessary information to output a two channel volumetric segmentation. The two features maps computed by the very last convolutional layer, having 1\times 1\times 1 kernel size and producing outputs of the same size as the input volume, are converted to probabilistic segmentations of the foreground and background regions by applying soft-max voxelwise.After each stage of the right portion of the CNN, a de-convolution operation is employed in order increase the size of the inputs (Figure 3) followed by one to three convolutional layers involving half the number of 5\times 5\times 5 kernels employed in the previous layer. Similar to the left part of the network, also in this case we resort to learn residual functions in the convolutional stages. We report in Table 1 the receptive fields of each network layer, showing the fact that the innermost portion of our CNN already captures the content of the whole input volume. We believe that this characteristic is important during segmentation of poorly visible anatomy: the features computed in the deepest layer perceive the whole anatomy of interest at once, since they are computed from data having a spatial support much larger than the typical size of the anatomy we seek to delineate, and therefore impose global constraints. The network predictions, which consist of two volumes having the same resolution as the original input data, are processed through a soft-max layer which outputs the probability of each voxel to belong to foreground and to background. In medical volumes such as the ones we are processing in this work, it is not uncommon that the anatomy of interest occupies only a very small region of the scan. This often causes the learning process to get trapped in local minima of the loss function yielding a network whose predictions are strongly biased towards background. As a result the foreground region is often missing or only partially detected. Several previous approaches resorted to loss functions based on sample re-weighting where foreground regions are given more importance than background ones during learning. In this work we propose a novel objective function based on dice coefficient, which is a quantity ranging between 0 and 1 which we aim to maximise. The dice coefficient D between two binary volumes can be written asD=\frac{2\sum_{i}^{N}p_{i}g_{i}}{\sum_{i}^{N}p_{i}^{2}+\sum_{i}^{N}g_{i}^{2}} A Previously unseen MRI volume can be segmented by processing it in a feed-forward manner through the network. The output of the last convolutional layer, after soft-max, consists of a probability map for background and foreground. The voxels having higher probability (>0.5) to belong to the foreground than to the background are considered part of the anatomy.

Annotated medical volumes are not easy to obtain due to the fact that one or more experts are required to manually trace a reliable ground truth annotation and that there is a cost associated with their acquisition.

CNNs have been recently used for medical image segmentation.Early approaches obtain anatomy delineation in images or volumes by performing patch-wise image classification. Such segmentations are obtained by only considering local context and therefore are prone to failure, especially in challenging modalities such as ultrasound, where a high number of mis-classified voxel are to be expected.Post-processing approaches such as connected components analysis normally yield no improvement and therefore, more recent works, propose to use the network predictions in combination with Markov random fields [6], voting strategies [9] or more traditional approaches such as level-sets [2].Patch-wise approaches also suffer from efficiency issues. When densely extracted patches are processed in a CNN, a high number of computations is redundant and therefore the total algorithm runtime is high. In this case, more efficient computational schemes can be adopted.

In Figure 2 we provide a schematic representation of our convolutional neural network.We perform convolutions aiming to both extract features from the data and, at the end of each stage, to reduce its resolution by using appropriate stride. The left part of the network consists of a compression path, while the right part decompresses the signal until its original size is reached. Convolutions are all applied with appropriate padding. The convolutions performed in each stage use volumetric kernels having size 5\times 5\times 5 voxels.As the data proceeds through different stages along the compression path, its resolution is reduced. This is performed through convolution with 2\times 2\times 2 voxels wide kernels applied with stride 2 (Figure 3). Since the second operation extracts features by considering only non overlapping 2\times 2\times 2 volume patches, the size of the resulting feature maps is halved.This strategy serves a similar purpose as pooling layers that, motivated by [16] and other works discouraging the use of max-pooling operations in CNNs, have been replaced in our approach by convolutional ones. Moreover, since the number of feature channels doubles at each stage of the compression path of the V-Net, and due to the formulation of the model as a residual network, we resort to these convolution operations to double the number of feature maps as we reduce their resolution.

We propose a novel objective function based on Dice coefficient maximisation, that we optimise during training.We demonstrate fast and accurate results on prostate MRI test volumes and we provide direct comparison with other methods which were evaluated on the same test data 111Detailed results available on http://promise12.grand-challenge.org/results/.",Due to the training/testing and augmentation on the diverse set of prostate scans all appearances of prostate can be encoded with V-Net.,"The unique design of SAT, which includes a subgraph structure extractor, allows for a formal study of the expressiveness of the output representations, demonstrating that the node representation from a structure-aware attention layer is at least as expressive as the subgraph representation given by the structure extractor",0.0740740695130318,0.0,0.037037032475995,0.7836102003552761,14.21612419794732,11.784153403114283,0.0972762645914396,0.0103364855948977,0.2358781397342682,0.3784222634885026,0.2358780801296234,0.2506316006183624,0.0066045110888858,0.0,0.7250489277873164,0.7881641777285424
818,How did authors claim that their approach overcome the problems that Ultrasound made to earlier approaches?,"We trained our method on 50 MRI volumes, and the relative manual ground truth annotation, obtained from the ”PROMISE2012” challenge dataset [7]. This dataset contains medical data acquired in different hospitals, using different equipment and different acquisition protocols. The data in this dataset is representative of the clinical variability and challenges encountered in clinical settings. As previously stated we massively augmented this dataset through random transformation performed in each training iteration, for each mini-batch fed to the network. The mini-batches used in our implementation contained two volumes each, mainly due to the high memory requirement of the model during training. We used a momentum of 0.99 and a initial learning rate of 0.0001 which decreases by one order of magnitude every 25K iterations. CNNs have been recently used for medical image segmentation.Early approaches obtain anatomy delineation in images or volumes by performing patch-wise image classification. Such segmentations are obtained by only considering local context and therefore are prone to failure, especially in challenging modalities such as ultrasound, where a high number of mis-classified voxel are to be expected.Post-processing approaches such as connected components analysis normally yield no improvement and therefore, more recent works, propose to use the network predictions in combination with Markov random fields [6], voting strategies [9] or more traditional approaches such as level-sets [2].Patch-wise approaches also suffer from efficiency issues. When densely extracted patches are processed in a CNN, a high number of computations is redundant and therefore the total algorithm runtime is high. In this case, more efficient computational schemes can be adopted.",V-Net solves the problem of patch based CNNs for ultrasound by using a 3D image volume.,"The author wants to show that GPT-Critic does not hurt the agent's capability to generate human-like sentences, as evidenced by the ﬂuency score being comparable to the baseline algorithms",0.0975609708506843,0.0,0.0975609708506843,1.2659248081122272,11.2716940665181,9.370354062904438,0.0815217391304347,0.0106266031513374,0.0411020144820213,0.317023019409842,0.0411020256578922,0.4209155142307281,0.0052658540375618,,0.7832503847722679,0.7373580955591288

831,Do Ciresan et al. treat each patch as a separated input in their previous approach in segmentation?,"The typical use of convolutional networks is on classification tasks, where the output to an image is a single class label. However, in many visual tasks, especially in biomedical image processing, the desired output should include localization, i.e., a class label is supposed to be assigned to each pixel. Moreover, thousands of training images are usually beyond reach in biomedical tasks. Hence, Ciresan et al. [1] trained a network in a sliding-window setup to predict the class label of each pixel by providing a local region (patch) around that pixel as input. First, this network can localize. Secondly, the training data in terms of patches is much larger than the number of training images. The resulting network won the EM segmentation challenge at ISBI 2012 by a large margin. Obviously, the strategy in Ciresan et al. [1] has two drawbacks. First, it is quite slow because the network must be run separately for each patch, and there is a lot of redundancy due to overlapping patches.Secondly, there is a trade-off between localization accuracy and the use of context. Larger patches require more max-pooling layers that reduce the localization accuracy, while small patches allow the network to see only little context.

833,What would happen to the model performance if we just use connections from earlier layers of contracting path while going deeper without upsampling to perform localization?,"In this paper, we build upon a more elegant architecture, the so-called “fully convolutional network” [9]. We modify and extend this architecture such that it works with very few training images and yields more precise segmentations; see Figure 1. The main idea in [9] is to supplement a usual contracting network by successive layers, where pooling operators are replaced by upsampling operators. Hence, these layers increase the resolution of the output. In order to localize, high resolution features from the contracting path are combined with the upsampled output. A successive convolution layer can then learn to assemble a more precise output based on this information. One important modification in our architecture is that in the upsampling part we have also a large number of feature channels, which allow the network to propagate context information to higher resolution layers. As a consequence, the expansive path is more or less symmetric to the contracting path, and yields a u-shaped architecture. The network does not have any fully connected layers and only uses the valid part of each convolution, i.e., the segmentation map only contains the pixels, for which the full context is available in the input image. This strategy allows the seamless segmentation of arbitrarily large images by an overlap-tile strategy (see Figure 2). To predict the pixels in the border region of the image, the missing context is extrapolated by mirroring the input image. This tiling strategy is important to apply the network to large images, since otherwise the resolution would be limited by the GPU memory.",Model need to match the size of expansion path with the contacting path at each stage. Otherwise the localization performance would suffer.,"The Optimus pre-training objectives and its information bottleneck approach differ from traditional VAEs used for image generation in several ways:

1. Latent vector injection: Optimus introduces two schemes to inject conditioning vectors into GPT-2 without re-training it, which is not a common practice in traditional VAEs.
2. Combining BERT/GPT-2: The design idea to combine existing PLMs for larger and complex models is a novel approach in Optimus, not typically seen in traditional VAEs.
3. Pre-training on massive datasets: Optimus demonstrates that pre-training on massive datasets can effectively reduce KL vanishing, whereas traditional VAEs often use smaller datasets.
4. IB perspective: Optimus provides a principled approach to balancing compactness and usability of learned representations from the perspective of information bottleneck, which is not a primary focus in traditional VAEs.

836,What is the contribution that augmentation data with deformation adds to the overall performance?,"Data augmentation is essential to teach the network the desired invariance and robustness properties, when only few training samples are available. In case of microscopical images we primarily need shift and rotation invariance as well as robustness to deformations and gray value variations. Especially random elastic deformations of the training samples seem to be the key concept to train a segmentation network with very few annotated images.We generate smooth deformations using random displacement vectors on a coarse 3 by 3 grid. The displacements are sampled from a Gaussian distribution with 10 pixels standard deviation. Per-pixel displacements are then computed using bicubic interpolation. Drop-out layers at the end of the contracting path perform further implicit data augmentation. The u-net (averaged over 7 rotated versions of the input data) achieves without any further pre- or postprocessing a warping error of 0.0003529 (the new best score, see Table 1) and a rand-error of 0.0382.

As for our tasks there is very little training data available, we use excessive data augmentation by applying elastic deformations to the available training images. This allows the network to learn invariance to such deformations, without the need to see these transformations in the annotated image corpus. This is particularly important in biomedical segmentation, since deformation used to be the most common variation in tissue and realistic deformations can be simulated efficiently.

848,Why was R-FCN unable to converge using only one score map?,"In this paper, we develop a framework called Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) for object detection. Our network consists of shared, fully convolutional architectures as is the case of FCN [15]. To incorporate translation variance into FCN, we construct a set of position-sensitive score maps by using a bank of specialized convolutional layers as the FCN output. Each of these score maps encodes the position information with respect to a relative spatial position (e.g., “to the left of an object”). On top of this FCN, we append a position-sensitive RoI pooling layer that shepherds information from these score maps, with no weight (convolutional/fc) layers following. The entire architecture is learned end-to-end. All learnable layers are convolutional and shared on the entire image, yet encode spatial information required for object detection. Figure 1 illustrates the key idea and Table 1 compares the methodologies among region-based detectors. The importance of position-sensitivity is further demonstrated by setting k=1, for which R-FCN is unable to converge. In this degraded case, no spatial information can be explicitly captured within an RoI. Moreover, we report that naïve Faster R-CNN is able to converge if its RoI pooling output resolution is 1\times 1, but the mAP further drops by a large margin to 61.7% (Table 2). Given the proposal regions (RoIs), the R-FCN architecture is designed to classify the RoIs into object categories and background. In R-FCN, all learnable weight layers are convolutional and are computed on the entire image. The last convolutional layer produces a bank of k^{2} position-sensitive score maps for each category, and thus has a k^{2}(C+1)-channel output layer with C object categories (+1 for background). The bank of k^{2} score maps correspond to a k\times k spatial grid describing relative positions. For example, with k\times k=3\times 3, the 9 score maps encode the cases of {top-left, top-center, top-right, …, bottom-right} of an object category.","R-FCN depends on the score maps of R-FCN for its output as the score maps are used for the rod pooling layer. Therefore, when the k = 1 and there is only one score map, RoIs don't actually capture any spatial information and therefore the model fails to learn the task.","Realistic samples are samples that have smooth deformations and preserve discriminative structures, unlike CDA which has discontinuous shapes and loses discriminative structures",0.0677966058029304,0.0,0.0677966058029304,0.9347836091389596,23.03568113002062,19.06491209778733,0.0379506641366223,0.0045624222314392,0.1051976010203361,0.4206503345561561,0.1174812167882919,0.4611476361751556,0.0074933114073909,,0.7277716011340378,0.7363320009037007
849,What was Faster R-CNN developed to overcome in the Fast R-CNN?,"There have been object detectors that can be thought of as “fully convolutional” models. OverFeat [21] detects objects by sliding multi-scale windows on the shared convolutional feature maps; similarly, in Fast R-CNN [6] and [12], sliding windows that replace region proposals are investigated. In these cases, one can recast a sliding window of a single scale as a single convolutional layer. The RPN component in Faster R-CNN [18] is a fully convolutional detector that predicts bounding boxes with respect to reference boxes (anchors) of multiple sizes. The original RPN is class-agnostic in [18], but its class-specific counterpart is applicable (see also [14]) as we evaluate in the following.","Faster R-CNN uses a RPN component to predict bounding boxes of objects it detects instead of sliding windows, which is what Fast R-CNN uses. From the names of the two models, it can be inferred that the change in methodology allowed Faster R-CNN to be more computationally efficient while still performing well.","No, the authors' proposed architecture cannot be replaced with newer model architectures such as attention-based models or transformers.

Faster R-CNN evaluates a 10-layer subnetwork for each region to achieve good accuracy, but R-FCN has negligible per-region cost.With 300 RoIs at test time, Faster R-CNN takes 0.42s per image, 2.5\times slower than our R-FCN that takes 0.17s per image (on a K40 GPU; this number is 0.11s on a Titan X GPU).

For an RoI rectangle of a size w\times h, a bin is of a size \approx\frac{w}{k}\times\frac{h}{k} [8, 6].In our method, the last convolutional layer is constructed to produce k^{2} score maps for each category. Inside the (i,j)-th bin (0\leq i,j\leq k-1), we define a position-sensitive RoI pooling operation that pools only over the (i,j)-th score map:r_{c}(i,j\leavevmode\nobreak\ |\leavevmode\nobreak\ \Theta)=\sum_{(x,y)\in\text{bin}(i,j)}z_{i,j,c}(x+x_{0},y+y_{0}\leavevmode\nobreak\ |\leavevmode\nobreak\ \Theta)/n.(1)Here r_{c}(i,j) is the pooled response in the (i,j)-th bin for the c-th category, z_{i,j,c} is one score map out of the k^{2}(C+1) score maps, (x_{0},y_{0}) denotes the top-left corner of an RoI, n is the number of pixels in the bin, and \Theta denotes all learnable parameters of the network.

858,Does each channel maps the a response from a different position of the image ?,"Visualization.In Figure 4 and 4 we visualize the position-sensitive score maps learned by R-FCN when k\times k=3\times 3. These specialized maps are expected to be strongly activated at a specific relative position of an object. For example, the “top-center-sensitive” score map exhibits high scores roughly near the top-center position of an object.If a candidate box precisely overlaps with a true object (Figure 4), most of the k^{2} bins in the RoI are strongly activated, and their voting leads to a high score. On the contrary, if a candidate box does not correctly overlaps with a true object (Figure 4), some of the k^{2} bins in the RoI are not activated, and the voting score is low. Given the proposal regions (RoIs), the R-FCN architecture is designed to classify the RoIs into object categories and background.

859,What are the benefits of selective pooling?,"The concept of position-sensitive score maps is partially inspired by [3] that develops FCNs for instance-level semantic segmentation.We further introduce the position-sensitive RoI pooling layer that shepherds learning of the score maps for object detection. There is no learnable layer after the RoI layer, enabling nearly cost-free region-wise computation and speeding up both training and inference. The importance of position-sensitivity is further demonstrated by setting k=1, for which R-FCN is unable to converge. In this degraded case, no spatial information can be explicitly captured within an RoI. Moreover, we report that naïve Faster R-CNN is able to converge if its RoI pooling output resolution is 1\times 1, but the mAP further drops by a large margin to 61.7% (Table 2). R-FCN ends with a position-sensitive RoI pooling layer. This layer aggregates the outputs of the last convolutional layer and generates scores for each RoI. Unlike [8, 6], our position-sensitive RoI layer conducts selective pooling, and each of the k\times k bin aggregates responses from only one score map out of the bank of k\times k score maps. With end-to-end training, this RoI layer shepherds the last convolutional layer to learn specialized position-sensitive score maps.Figure 1 illustrates this idea. Figure 4 and 4 visualize an example. The details are introduced as follows.","Selective pooling allows the model to learn position-sensitive score maps, which contain information crucial for learning. This can be seen from the k = 1 case, meaning there is only one score map and no spatial information is learned, where the model fails to converge.

860,What's the reason for sharing features between R-FCN and RPN,"Inference. As illustrated in Figure 2, the feature maps shared between RPN and R-FCN are computed (on an image with a single scale of 600). Then the RPN part proposes RoIs, on which the R-FCN part evaluates category-wise scores and regresses bounding boxes.During inference we evaluate 300 RoIs as in [18] for fair comparisons. The results are post-processed by non-maximum suppression (NMS) using a threshold of 0.3 IoU [7], as standard practice.","The feature maps contain information from the input image. The RPN uses those features to find RoIs, while the R-FCN uses those features to detect objects.","The problem is strictly convex because the objective function s(x) = P Ni xi log xi is strictly convex.

In other words, the Hessian matrix of the function is a diagonal matrix with positive elements, which ensures that the function is strictly convex",0.0816326482299044,0.0,0.0816326482299044,0.965407762379893,18.346206981690884,15.199764972147925,0.1612903225806451,0.0106356665842196,0.0411871671676635,0.3970987116427799,0.0557871013879776,0.2015313953161239,0.0041676361086344,0.0,0.7115676816384701,0.685770949054535
861,Should we need to increase the size of the network to reach considerable efficiency after adding region-wise layers?,"In this paper, we develop a framework called Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) for object detection. Our network consists of shared, fully convolutional architectures as is the case of FCN [15]. To incorporate translation variance into FCN, we construct a set of position-sensitive score maps by using a bank of specialized convolutional layers as the FCN output. Each of these score maps encodes the position information with respect to a relative spatial position (e.g., “to the left of an object”). On top of this FCN, we append a position-sensitive RoI pooling layer that shepherds information from these score maps, with no weight (convolutional/fc) layers following. The entire architecture is learned end-to-end. All learnable layers are convolutional and shared on the entire image, yet encode spatial information required for object detection. Figure 1 illustrates the key idea and Table 1 compares the methodologies among region-based detectors. On the other hand, our R-FCN system has significantly better accuracy (Table 2). Its mAP (76.6%) is on par with the standard Faster R-CNN’s (76.4%, Table 5). These results indicate that our position-sensitive strategy manages to encode useful spatial information for locating objects, without using any learnable layer after RoI pooling. Next we compare with standard “Faster R-CNN + ResNet-101” [9] which is the strongest competitor and the top-performer on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ImageNet benchmarks. We use k\times k=7\times 7 in the following.Table 5 shows the comparisons. Faster R-CNN evaluates a 10-layer subnetwork for each region to achieve good accuracy, but R-FCN has negligible per-region cost.With 300 RoIs at test time, Faster R-CNN takes 0.42s per image, 2.5\times slower than our R-FCN that takes 0.17s per image (on a K40 GPU; this number is 0.11s on a Titan X GPU). R-FCN also trains faster than Faster R-CNN.Moreover, hard example mining [22] adds no cost to R-FCN training (Table 5).It is feasible to train R-FCN when mining from 2000 RoIs, in which case Faster R-CNN is 6\times slower (2.9s vs. 0.46s). But experiments show that mining from a larger set of candidates (e.g., 2000) has no benefit (Table 5). So we use 300 RoIs for both training and inference in other parts of this paper. We presented Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks, a simple but accurate and efficient framework for object detection. Our system naturally adopts the state-of-the-art image classification backbones, such as ResNets, that are by design fully convolutional. Our method achieves accuracy competitive with the Faster R-CNN counterpart, but is much faster during both training and inference.","No, as seen by the model presented in the paper, performance can be maintained or even improved while keeping computational efficiency high and not adding region-wise layers.","Yes, the performance difference between Self-Instruct training and SuperNI training was significant.

862,"What do authors mean by saying that RoI layer was added ""unnaturally"" in the ResNet  ?","A prevalent family [8, 6, 18] of deep networks for object detection can be divided into two subnetworks by the Region-of-Interest (RoI) pooling layer [6]: (i) a shared, “fully convolutional” subnetwork independent of RoIs, and (ii) an RoI-wise subnetwork that does not share computation. This decomposition [8] was historically resulted from the pioneering classification architectures, such as AlexNet [10] and VGG Nets [23], that consist of two subnetworks by design — a convolutional subnetwork ending with a spatial pooling layer, followed by several fully-connected (fc) layers. Thus the (last) spatial pooling layer in image classification networks is naturally turned into the RoI pooling layer in object detection networks [8, 6, 18]. But recent state-of-the-art image classification networks such as Residual Nets (ResNets) [9] and GoogLeNets [24, 26] are by design fully convolutional111Only the last layer is fully-connected, which is removed and replaced when fine-tuning for object detection.. By analogy, it appears natural to use all convolutional layers to construct the shared, convolutional subnetwork in the object detection architecture, leaving the RoI-wise subnetwork no hidden layer. However, as empirically investigated in this work, this naïve solution turns out to have considerably inferior detection accuracy that does not match the network’s superior classification accuracy. To remedy this issue, in the ResNet paper [9] the RoI pooling layer of the Faster R-CNN detector [18] is unnaturally inserted between two sets of convolutional layers — this creates a deeper RoI-wise subnetwork that improves accuracy, at the cost of lower speed due to the unshared per-RoI computation.","Old object detection networks used two subnetworks, one being a convolutional subnetwork with a pooling layer, and another being fully connected layers. The pooling layer served as a RoI pooling layer. The authors imply that natural intuition for creating a fully convolutional network would be to get rid of the fully connected layers and just keep using the final pooling layer as the only layer in the RoI subnetwork. But in ResNet, the RoI subnetwork is actually in the middle of the network, which the authors deem to be unnatural.","An example of a ""module"" in CNN is the Inception module, which is a building block composed of multiple convolutional layers with different fixed dimensions, such as 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, and 1x3, 3x1",0.2588235248442907,0.0,0.2588235248442907,1.4879867721118225,22.26207523389269,21.32309700830831,0.1029252437703141,0.0039131981501245,0.4437102079391479,0.4453935621091094,0.4874659180641174,0.7432230114936829,0.048634018861416,1.0,0.7215722566732659,0.8127763108205581

Analysis. Table 2 shows the results. We note that the standard (not naïve) Faster R-CNN in the ResNet paper [9] achieves 76.4% mAP with ResNet-101 (see also Table 5), which inserts the RoI pooling layer between conv4 and conv5 [9]. As a comparison, the naïve Faster R-CNN (that applies RoI pooling after conv5) has a drastically lower mAP of 68.9% (Table 2). This comparison empirically justifies the importance of respecting spatial information by inserting RoI pooling between layers for the Faster R-CNN system. Similar observations are reported in [19]. Naïve Faster R-CNN. As discussed in the introduction, one may use all convolutional layers in ResNet-101 to compute the shared feature maps, and adopt RoI pooling after the last convolutional layer (after conv5).

Each utterance is processed as the response of previous 10 context utterances from both speakers. The baseline methods are described in Appendix. We measure the performance using Bleu (Chen and Cherry, 2014), and compute the precision, recall and Fl in Table 4. OPTIMUS shows higher Bleu scores than all existing baselines.","There is no information about dialog generation specifically, to explain if this outperformance by OPTIMUS can be attributed specifically to being able to encode the entire dialog in latent space.","MIRA is similar to other clustering-based methods such as SwaV in that they both use clustering to learn representations, but MIRA differs in that it does not rely on artificial constraints such as equipartition, and instead uses mutual information regularization to maximize the mutual information between the pseudo-labels and the data",0.1515151466804409,0.0,0.0909090860743804,1.0120780787809658,19.90385784869268,16.977381776982618,0.1319648093841642,0.0107345821932224,0.1006859391927719,0.4053635523377396,0.1006858274340629,0.200289636850357,0.0124503048555342,0.2,0.7448934330868023,0.7684948610544144
874,"Are there any similar approaches to OPTIMUS, but on bigger and more modern architectures (e.g., GPT-J, T5)?","While deep generative models (DGMs) such as VAEs are theoretically attractive due to its principle nature, it is now rarely used by practitioners in the modern pre-trained language modeling era where BERT/GPT dominate with strong empirical performance. That’s why this paper makes a timely contribution to making DGMs practical for NLP. We hope that this paper will help renew interest in DGMs for this purpose.Hence, we deliberately keep a simple model, believing that the first pre-trained big VAE model itself and its implications are novel: it helps the community to recognize the importance of DGMs in the pre-training era, and revisit DGMs to make it more practical.Indeed, Optimus is uniquely positioned to learn a smooth latent space to organize sentences, which can enable guided language generation compared with GPT-2, and yield better generalization in low-resource language understanding tasks than BERT. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma and Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) provide a tractable method to train latent-variable generative models. In NLP, latent variables may assume the role of higher-level sentence representations, which govern a lower-level word-by-word generation process, thus facilitating controlled text generation (Bowman et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2017). By representing sentences in a low-dimensional latent space, VAEs allow easy manipulation of sentences using the corresponding compact vector representations, such as feature regularization specified by prior distributions, and guided sentence generation with interpretable vector operators. Despite the attractive theoretical strengths, the current language VAEs are often built with shallow network architectures, such as two-layer LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). This limits the model’s capacity and leads to sub-optimal performance.","This paper does not mention any existing approaches similar to OPTIMUS which use larger models such as GPT-J or T-5. The authors do mention in multiple places that using VAEs (which is what OPTIMUS is) is not very common in the field, and that existing attempts to use VAEs for language modelling typically use smaller models that are not very deep. Both these pieces of information suggest that work using models such as GPT-J or T5 for similar VAE-based approaches does not exist, but it is not possible to say that with certainty from the contents of this paper alone.","Sure!

Maximum length T used for the experiment was 10.

This means that for the experiment, the maximum length of the sequences was 10, and any sequences longer than 10 were truncated to 10.

As for the ratio of sequences that were longer than length T, the context does not provide direct information on this.

875,How is the Optimus pre-training objectives and its information bottleneck approach any different to those of traditional VAEs (used for image generation)?,"From an information theory perspective, information bottleneck (IB) provides a principled approach to find the trade-off between predictive power and complexity (compactness) when summarizing observed data in learned representations. We show that our Optimus pre-training objectives effectively practice the IB principle as follows. Along the way to build the first big VAE language model, there are several technical contributions/implications that are novel: (\textup{\it i}) Latent vector injection: this work demonstrates two schemes to discuss how to effectively inject conditioning vectors into GPT-2 without re-training it.(\textup{\it ii}) The design idea to combine BERT/GPT-2 serves as a practical recipe to inspire people to integrate and reuse existing PLMs for larger and complex models.(\textup{\it iii}) Pre-training on massive datasets itself is an effective approach to reduce KL vanishing, as demonstrated by the state of-the-art performance on four VAE language modeling datasets. (\textup{\it iv}) The proof of VAE objective from the lens of IB, showing that VAE is a principled approach to balance the compactness and usability of learned representations.(\textup{\it v}) Improved performance on several language tasks shows the importance and necessity of pre-training a latent space.","The paper explains how information theoretic principles can be used to measure the predictive power of a model and its' compactness (a measure of how complex the learned representations are)and represent it as a tradeoff. They explain how they manage to inject conditioning vectors into GPT without having to pretrain it again specifically for this and also discuss how they combine GPT and BERT. However, the authors do not specifically discuss the differences between their VAE by comparing it with VAEs used for image generation. Presumably, this might be because the authors intended to create a simple VAE model, as a proof of concept that such models can work well for language tasks as well, which is why might not be making extensive customisations to tailor VAEs for language tasks.","The use of shortcut connections in this paper differs from previous practices and theories in several ways. Unlike MLPs, which add a linear layer connected from the network input to the output, or highway networks with gating functions, our identity shortcuts are parameter-free and always pass information through. Additionally, while highway networks have not demonstrated accuracy gains with extremely increased depth, our formulation learns residual functions and can handle deep networks",0.1744966394594839,0.0,0.1208053642916987,0.9334675033134084,32.760624440085195,27.762660490521828,0.1106194690265486,0.0057392288416457,0.2715845704078674,0.5377980692037956,0.2333191434542337,0.406364232301712,0.0043773130995122,,0.7997055663580458,0.8008884531569662
876,"How are WordPiece Embeddings and Byte Pair Encoding tokenization different, and why do BERT and GPT-2 use them respectively?","PLMs can generally play two different roles:(\textup{\it i})a generic encoder such as BERT Devlin et al. (2019) to provide contextualized representations for language understanding tasks, and(\textup{\it ii})a powerful decoder such as GPT-2 Radford et al. (2019) to generate text sequences in an auto-regressive manner. In a bid to combine language understanding and generation tasks in one unified framework, several model variants have been proposed, including UniLM Dong et al. (2019), BART Lewis et al. (2019), and T5 Raffel et al. (2019). Although significant performance improvement has been reported on a wide range of NLP tasks, these models lack of explicit modeling of structures in a compact latent space, rendering it difficult to control language generation/representation from an abstract level. Two technical questions remain, when pre-training Optimus from BERT & GPT-2:(\textup{\it i}) How to represent sentences, since the two PLMs employ different tokenization schemes?(\textup{\it ii}) How to adapt a pre-trained GPT-2 to arbitrary conditional input without re-training the model again? Controllable GPT-2 models have been studied in Keskar et al. (2019); Zellers et al. (2019); Peng et al. (2020a, b) when prescribed control codes/tokens are provided, but it is still unknown how to ground GPT-2 to arbitrary conditional inputs. In BERT, WordPiece Embeddings (WPE) is used for tokenization (vocabulary size is 28996 for the cased version). In GPT-2, the modified Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Radford et al. (2019) is used for tokenization (vocabulary size is 50260). A given token is represented as {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Emb}}, by summing the corresponding token, position and segment embeddings 333Optimus does not require segment embeddings, but we remain it due to BERT initialization..For a sentence, we present it in both types of tokenization: the input of encoder is WPE, and the output of decoder is BPE to compute the reconstruction loss. However, the only source of variation in NLMs, GPT2 and GPT3 is modeled in the conditionals at every step: the text generation process only depends on previous word tokens, and there is limited capacity for the generation to be guided by the higher-level structures that are likely presented in natural language, such as tense, topics or sentiment.","BERT and GPT2 are different kinds of models, which is why they might be using different kinds of encoding schemes. BERT is primarily an encoder model, while GPT-like models are generative models that autoregressively predict the next token based on the series of tokens seen so far. This primary difference in class of models might explain why BERT uses WPE while GPT uses BPE tokenization. More details on why these specific tokenization schemes are used for each model can not be found in this paper.","The author emphasizes their model as ""zero-shot"" because it does not rely on any external knowledge or pre-training, instead using only a short text description to link entities, achieving state-of-the-art performance levels for large-scale entity linking",0.1020408116784675,0.0,0.0816326484131614,0.6425994823525032,24.58344044759211,20.22367140239564,0.0465657741559953,0.0043186180422264,0.1297724545001983,0.4647356269368298,0.2410868406295776,0.3965747058391571,0.0090519260782347,0.6,0.7661573160965826,0.7799647182819759
877,"If the same information from the latent vector is being added during decoding, why did the Memory scheme yield higher performance?","Similar to BERT, the first token of every sentence is always a special classification token ([CLS]). The last-layer hidden state {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}\in\mathbb{R}^{H} corresponding to this token is used as the sentence-level representation. It further constructs the latent representation \boldsymbol{z}={{\bf W}}_{\text{E}}{\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}, where \boldsymbol{z}\in\mathbb{R}^{P} is a P-dimensional vector and {{\bf W}}_{\text{E}}\in\mathbb{R}^{P\times H} is the weight matrix. To facilitate \boldsymbol{z} in GPT-2 decoding without re-training the weights, we consider two schemes, illustrated in Figure 2:•Memory: \boldsymbol{z} plays the role of an additional memory vector {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Mem}} for GPT2 to attend. Specifically, {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Mem}}={{\bf W}}_{\text{M}}\boldsymbol{z}, where {{\bf W}}_{\text{M}}\in\mathbb{R}^{LH\times P} is the weight matrix. {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Mem}}\in\mathbb{R}^{LH} is separated into L vectors of length H, each of which is attended by GPT-2 in one layer.•Embedding: \boldsymbol{z} is added on the original embedding layer, and directly used in every decoding step. The new embedding representation is {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Emb}}^{\prime}={\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Emb}}+{{\bf W}}_{\text{D}}\boldsymbol{z}, where {{\bf W}}_{\text{D}}\in\mathbb{R}^{H\times P}.We study their empirical performance in Section B.1 of Appendix, and observe that Memory is significantly more effective than Embedding, and the integration of both schemes yields slightly better results. We hypothesize that the reason why Memory is superior is because it allows the decoder to attend the latent information at every layer ofthe network directly, while the Embedding method only allows the decoder to see the latentinformation at the input and output layer.In our experiments, we use the integration scheme by default.In summary, the encoder parameters \boldsymbol{\phi}=\{\boldsymbol{\phi}_{\text{BERT}},{{\bf W}}_{\text{E}}\}, and decoder parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}=\{\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{GPT-2}},{{\bf W}}_{\text{M}},{{\bf W}}_{\text{D}}\}.","The authors theorize that the memory scheme is better since the latent information is accessible to every layer in the neural network, instead of being available to only two layers (input, output) in the embedding approach.","By eliminating bounding box proposals and resampling stages, and adding improvements such as using small convolutional filters for object category and offset predictions, separate predictors for different aspect ratios, and applying filters to multiple feature maps for detection at multiple scales",0.031249995019532,0.0,0.031249995019532,1.0953039711178436,18.61953459706281,14.838016847740976,0.036319612590799,0.0099009900990099,0.1066586822271347,0.4327806408566552,0.1066586896777153,0.3040502369403839,0.0029116661865133,,0.7782761874627896,0.7797296853966882
878,"Why does annealing the value of beta and, as a consequence, decrease the KL regularization during training cause the decoder to make greater use of z?","To reduce this issue, we follow the intuition that if the encoder is providing useful information from the beginning of decoder training, the decoder is more likely to make use of \boldsymbol{z} Fu et al. (2019); He et al. (2019). Specifically, we use the cyclical schedule to anneal \beta for 10 periods Fu et al. (2019).Within one period, there are three consecutive stages: Training AE (\beta=0) for 0.5 proportion, annealing \beta from 0 to 1 for 0.25 proportion, and fixing \beta=1 for 0.25 proportion. When \beta>0, we use the KL thresholding scheme Li et al. (2019); Kingma et al. (2016), and replace the KL term \mathcal{L}_{R} in (6) with a hinge loss term that maxes each component of the original KL with a constant \lambda:ℒR′=∑imax[λ,KL(qϕ(zi|𝒙)||p(zi))]\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{R}^{\prime}=\sum_{i}\max[\lambda,\mbox{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(z_{i}|\boldsymbol{x})||p(z_{i}))]caligraphic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_max [ italic_λ , KL ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | bold_italic_x ) | | italic_p ( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ) ](9)Here, z_{i} denotes the ith dimension of \boldsymbol{z}. Usingthe thresholding objective causes learning to give up driving down KL for dimensions of \boldsymbol{z} that are already beneath the target compression rate. Due to the regularization term \mathcal{L}_{R}, Optimus can organize sentences in the way specified by the prior distribution. For basic VAEs, a smooth feature space is learned, which is specifically beneficial for better generalization when the number of task-specific labeled data is low.To have a fair comparison, we follow the BERT paper, where the hidden feature of [CLS] is used as thesentence-level representation. In this way, the linear classifiers for both models have the same number of trainableparameters. Though the latent vector \boldsymbol{z} is typically used as sentence-level representation in VAE literature, we argue that the KL regularization applied on \boldsymbol{z} has a large impact on the preceding layer feature {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}.Specifically, {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}} is fed into an linear classifier {{\bf W}}_{\text{C}}\in\mathbb{R}^{K\times H}, where K is the number of classes, with objective -\log(\text{softmax}({\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}{{\bf W}}_{\text{C}}^{\top})). Two schemes are used:(\textup{\it i}) Fine-tuning, where both the pre-trained model and the classifier are updated;(\textup{\it ii}) Feature-based, where pre-trained model weights are frozen to provide embeddings for the classifier update.","While the authors explained in detail the method in which they cyclically annealed the value of beta while training their VAE and that KL regularization impacts features on the previous layer, this paper does not delve into the reasons why annealing the value of beta causes the decoder to make greater use of z. This is possibly because annealing beta as described in the paper is a widely used practice while training models such as these, which is why the authors may not have chosen to explain this assuming that these are broadly known pieces of information.","Sure!

879,Why does higher performance than hierarchical VAE (hVAE) show that it is important to pre-train a latent space? Did hVAE not pre-train a latent space or was the approach different?,"The results are shown in Table 1. Various \lambda values are used, we observe a trade-off between language modeling and representation learning, controlled by \lambda. Compared with existing VAE methods, Optimus achieve significantly lower perplexity, and higher MI/AU. This indicates that our pre-training method is an effective approach to reduce KL vanishing issue and training VAEs, especially given the fact that we only fine-tune on these datasets for one epoch. Optimus achieves lower perplexity compared with GPT-2 on three out of four datasets. Intuitively, this is because the model can leverage the prior language knowledge encoded in \boldsymbol{z}. This gap is larger, when the sentences in the dataset exhibit common regularities, such as \mathtt{SNLI}, where the prior plays a more important/effective role in this scenario.Though the form of our model is simple, Optimus shows stronger empirical performance than sophisticated models that are particularly designed for long-text, such as hVAE in Shen et al. (2019). For example, the KL and PPL ofOptimus (15.09 and 22.79) are much better than hVAE (6.8 and 45.8) on Yelp dataset. This verifies the importance of pre-training a latent space.The full experimental results are shown in Table 8, 9, 10 and 11 of Appendix.","This paper does not contain detailed information about VAEs so answering it with information from this paper is not possible.

A conditional GAN Mirza and Osindero (2014) is trained on the fixed latent space. The generation process is to first produce a latent vector \boldsymbol{z}_{y} based on a given label y using conditional GAN, then generate sentences conditioned on \boldsymbol{z}_{y} using the decoder.The baselines are described in Appendix. G-score computes the geometric mean of Accuracy and Bleu, measuring the comprehensive quality of both content and style.Self-Bleu measures the diversity of the generated sentences. The results are shown in Table 6, Optimus achieves the best performance on all metrics.This verifies the importance of learning a smooth and meaningful latent space.The conditional generated sentences are shown in Appendix.","The conditional GAN generates a latent vector which is then passed to OPTIMUS' decoder, which produces the output. It is unclear if merely passing a label to OPTIMUS' encoder would be sufficient to generate a useful latent space encoding since the OPTIMUS encoder has not been trained with this objective in mind.","Sure!

Because larger models have more capacity to learn from human annotations, resulting in greater improvements in performance through instruction-tuning",0.0857142809142859,0.0,0.0857142809142859,1.034508119066299,23.784937008975472,19.79516885471968,0.0547445255474452,0.0062867572500506,0.1720182001590728,0.3764627968268427,0.129222109913826,0.3515735268592834,0.0031404517068357,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.7727020043061424
883,What metric did the authors use to measure generalizability on low-resource language understanding tasks?,"We further consider the GLUE benchmark Wang et al. (2019), which consists of nine datasets for general language understanding.Following the finetuning schedule in Devlin et al. (2019), we use learning rate [2,3,4,5]\times 10^{-5} and train the model for 3 epochs. We select the best performance among different runs. We show the results on the validation set in Table 7.With the feature-based scheme, Optimus yields higher performance than BERT, especially on the large datasets such as MNLI, QQP and QNLI. When the full models are fine-tuned, the two methods perform quite similarly. In summary, the scenarios that Optimus fit the low-resource settings are two-fold: (1) The required computing resource is low: the feature-based approach only updates the classifier, whosecomputing requirement is much lower than full-model fine-tuning; (2) The number of required labelled data is low: when labelled data is rare, Optimus adapts better.The results confirm that Optimus can maintain and exploit the structures learned in pre-training, and presents a more general representation that can be adapted to new tasks more easily than BERT – feature-based adaption is much faster and easier to perform than fine-tuning.","The main performance metric the authors use to measure generalizability on low resource is the GLUE benchmark. More broadly, the authors explain that their model is suitable for low resource settings to begin with since their model can be specialized at low cost (through feature based approaches) and can function with very little labelled data.","Sure!

Only \mathcal{L}_{E} is considered (\beta=0), while the Gaussian sampling in q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z}|\boldsymbol{x}) remains. In other words, the regularization is removed, and a point-estimate is likely to be learned to represent the text sequence’s latent feature.Note our reconstruction is on sentence-level, while other PLMs Devlin et al. (2019); Yang et al. (2019) employ masked LM loss, performing token-level reconstruction. •VAE. The full VAE objective is considered (\beta>0). It tends to learn a smooth latent space due to \mathcal{L}_{R}. Due to the regularization term \mathcal{L}_{R}, Optimus can organize sentences in the way specified by the prior distribution. For basic VAEs, a smooth feature space is learned, which is specifically beneficial for better generalization when the number of task-specific labeled data is low.To have a fair comparison, we follow the BERT paper, where the hidden feature of [CLS] is used as thesentence-level representation. In this way, the linear classifiers for both models have the same number of trainableparameters. Though the latent vector \boldsymbol{z} is typically used as sentence-level representation in VAE literature, we argue that the KL regularization applied on \boldsymbol{z} has a large impact on the preceding layer feature {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}.Specifically, {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}} is fed into an linear classifier {{\bf W}}_{\text{C}}\in\mathbb{R}^{K\times H}, where K is the number of classes, with objective -\log(\text{softmax}({\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}{{\bf W}}_{\text{C}}^{\top})). Two schemes are used:(\textup{\it i}) Fine-tuning, where both the pre-trained model and the classifier are updated;(\textup{\it ii}) Feature-based, where pre-trained model weights are frozen to provide embeddings for the classifier update. We use tSNE Maaten and Hinton (2008) to visualize the learned feature on a 2D map.

To this end, we add ""positional encodings"" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d_{\text{model}} as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed (JonasFaceNet2017, ). We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings (JonasFaceNet2017, ) instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.",The two choices of Positional encoding are learned and fixed.

891,Can't we use parallelization with RNN layers approach with any possible way?,"Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h_{t}, as a function of the previous hidden state h_{t-1} and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks (Kuchaiev2017Factorization, ) and conditional computation (shazeer2017outrageously, ), while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains. As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece (wu2016google, ) and byte-pair (sennrich2015neural, ) representations.To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work. For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.

900,Do conv Nets succeed in sequence modelling in general?,"A single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O(log_{k}(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions (NalBytenet2017, ), increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network.Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions (xception2016, ), however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O(k\cdot n\cdot d+n\cdot d^{2}). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model. The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU (extendedngpu, ), ByteNet (NalBytenet2017, ) and ConvS2S (JonasFaceNet2017, ), all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions (hochreiter2001gradient, ).

902,"Is it crucial to use 6 layers in the encoder? if it is free to change, Does increasing those layers need more data to avoid overfitting or just would take longer time to converge?","The encoder is composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection (he2016deep, ) around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization layernorm2016 . That is, the output of each sub-layer is \mathrm{LayerNorm}(x+\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)), where \mathrm{Sublayer}(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself.

903,Why -while having data of next positions in training dataset- is it important to modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to ensure that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than ?,"The decoder is also composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.

This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i. The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:•In ""encoder-decoder attention"" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as (wu2016google, ; bahdanau2014neural, ; JonasFaceNet2017, ).•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -\infty) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.",Self attention layer in transformer is modified in decoder stack to attend only the past predictions to preserve the auto-regressive property in the language models.,"The authors judged the generated instructions as ""meaningful"" based on expert annotation, where an expert annotator labeled each instance as correct or not in terms of the instruction, input, and output",0.0833333284722225,0.0,0.0833333284722225,1.2941537419346831,22.70904192872197,18.16271966584185,0.074074074074074,0.0105765950187649,0.2066991776227951,0.4115712066549202,0.2066991478204727,0.3084341883659363,0.0090649447433714,0.5,0.758038735595726,0.7504121568545851
904,What is Attention Function?How is it calculated?,"An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention (bahdanau2014neural, ), and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations (cheng2016long, ; decomposableAttnModel, ; paulus2017deep, ; lin2017structured, ).",Attention function relates different positions of the sequence to get the overall representation of the sequence. It can be computer by additive attention method or the dot-product method.

906,What is the Difference Between Additive and Multiplicative Attention?,"The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention (bahdanau2014neural, ), and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. While for small values of d_{k} the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d_{k} (DBLP:journals/corr/BritzGLL17, ). We suspect that for large values of d_{k}, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 111To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q\cdot k=\sum_{i=1}^{d_{k}}q_{i}k_{i}, has mean 0 and variance d_{k}.. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}.",Dot product attention is calculated using optimized matrix multiplication  operations whereas Additive attention is computed by compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer.

Section 3 describes the MobileNet architecture and two hyper-parameters width multiplier and resolution multiplier to define smaller and more efficient MobileNets. Section 4 describes experiments on ImageNet as well a variety of different applications and use cases. Section 5 closes with a summary and conclusion. There has been rising interest in building small and efficient neural networks in the recent literature, e.g. [16, 34, 12, 36, 22]. Many different approaches can be generally categorized into either compressing pretrained networks or training small networks directly. This paper proposes a class of network architectures that allows a model developer to specifically choose a small network that matches the resource restrictions (latency, size) for their application. MobileNets primarily focus on optimizing for latency but also yield small networks. Many papers on small networks focus only on size but do not consider speed. MobileNets are built primarily from depthwise separable convolutions initially introduced in [26] and subsequently used in Inception models [13] to reduce the computation in the first few layers. Flattened networks [16] build a network out of fully factorized convolutions and showed the potential of extremely factorized networks. Independent of this current paper, Factorized Networks[34] introduces a similar factorized convolution as well as the use of topological connections. Subsequently, the Xception network [3] demonstrated how to scale up depthwise separable filters to out perform Inception V3 networks.

917,What is a depthwise separable convolution means?,"The standard convolution operation has the effect of filtering features based on theconvolutional kernels and combining features in order to produce a new representation.The filtering and combination steps can be split into two steps via the use offactorized convolutions called depthwise separable convolutions for substantial reduction in computational cost. Depthwise separable convolution are made up of two layers: depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions.We use depthwise convolutions to apply a single filter per each input channel (input depth). Pointwise convolution, asimple 1\times 1 convolution, is then used to create a linear combination of the output of the depthwise layer. MobileNets use bothbatchnorm and ReLU nonlinearities for both layers. Depthwise convolution is extremely efficient relative to standard convolution. However it only filters input channels, it does not combine them to create new features. So an additional layer that computes a linear combination of the output of depthwise convolution via 1\times 1 convolution is needed in order to generate these new features. The combination of depthwise convolution and 1\times 1 (pointwise) convolution is called depthwise separable convolution which was originally introduced in [26]. The MobileNet model is based on depthwise separable convolutions which is a form of factorized convolutions which factorize a standard convolution into a depthwise convolution and a 1\times 1 convolution called a pointwise convolution. For MobileNets the depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel. The pointwise convolution then applies a 1\times 1 convolution to combine the outputs the depthwise convolution. A standard convolution both filters and combines inputs into a new set of outputs in one step.

920,What are the layers of depthwise separable convolution and discuss the function of each of them.,"Depthwise separable convolution are made up of two layers: depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions.We use depthwise convolutions to apply a single filter per each input channel (input depth). Pointwise convolution, asimple 1\times 1 convolution, is then used to create a linear combination of the output of the depthwise layer. MobileNets use bothbatchnorm and ReLU nonlinearities for both layers. The MobileNet model is based on depthwise separable convolutions which is a form of factorized convolutions which factorize a standard convolution into a depthwise convolution and a 1\times 1 convolution called a pointwise convolution. For MobileNets the depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel. The pointwise convolution then applies a 1\times 1 convolution to combine the outputs the depthwise convolution. A standard convolution both filters and combines inputs into a new set of outputs in one step. The depthwise separable convolution splits this into two layers, a separate layer for filtering and a separate layer for combining. This factorization has the effect of drastically reducing computation and model size. Figure 2 shows how a standard convolution 2(a) is factorized into a depthwise convolution 2(b) and a 1\times 1 pointwise convolution 2(c).",Depthwise separable convolutions have two layers—depthwise and pointwise.

The MobileNet model has only 13 million parameters with the usual 3 million for the body and 10 million for the final layer and 0.58 Million mult-adds. As shown in Tab. 11, the MobileNet version delivers only slightly decreased performance compared to PlaNet despite being much more compact. Moreover, it still outperforms Im2GPS by a large margin.

The models are trained on COCO train+val excluding 8k minival images and evaluated on minival.For both frameworks, MobileNet achieves comparable results to other networks with only a fraction of computational complexity and model size. We proposed a new model architecture called MobileNets based on depthwise separable convolutions. We investigated some of the important design decisions leading to an efficient model. We then demonstrated how to build smaller and faster MobileNets using width multiplier and resolution multiplier by trading off a reasonable amount of accuracy to reduce size and latency. We then compared different MobileNets to popular models demonstrating superior size, speed and accuracy characteristics. We concluded by demonstrating MobileNet’s effectiveness when applied to a wide variety of tasks.

931,What are the reasons for the remarkable progress in the image recognition task? ,"Tremendous progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets (i.e. ImageNet [1, 2]) and the recent revival of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) [3, 4].For data-driven learning, large-scale well-annotated datasets with representative data distribution characteristics are crucial to learning more accurate or generalizable models [5, 4].Unlike previous image datasets used in computer vision, ImageNet [1] offers a very comprehensive database of more than 1.2 million categorized natural images of 1000+ classes.The CNN models trained upon this database serve as the backbone for significantly improving many object detection and image segmentation problems using other datasets [6, 7], e.g., PASCAL [8] and medical image categorization [9, 10, 11, 12].However, there exists no large-scale annotated medical image dataset comparable to ImageNet, as data acquisition is difficult, and quality annotation is costly.","The authors cite the increases in the number of well-constructed large-scale datasets and the usage of CNNs as the main reasons for the progress in the field of image recognition.

932,Give examples of two techniques of employing CNNs to medical image,"There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: 1) training the “CNN from scratch” [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]; 2) using “off-the-shelf CNN” features (without retraining the CNN) as complementary information channels to existing hand-crafted image features, for Chest X-rays [10] and CT lung nodule identification [9, 12]; and 3) performing unsupervised pre-training on natural or medical images and fine-tuning on medical target images using CNN or other types of deep learning models [18, 19, 20, 21].A decompositional 2.5D view resampling and an aggregation of random view classification scores are used to eliminate the “curse-of-dimensionality” issue in [22], in order to acquire a sufficient number of training image samples. Although natural images and medical images differ significantly, conventional image descriptors developed for object recognition in natural images, such as the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) [30] and the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) [31], have been widely used for object detection and segmentation in medical image analysis. Recently, ImageNet pre-trained CNNs have been used for chest pathology identification and detection in X-ray and CT modalities [10, 9, 12].They have yielded the best performance results by integrating low-level image features (e.g., GIST [32], bag of visual words (BoVW) and bag-of-frequency [12]). However, the fine-tuning of an ImageNet pre-trained CNN model on medical image datasets has not yet been exploited. Until the detection aggregation approach [22], [41], thoracoabdominal lymph node (LN) detection via CADe mechanisms has yielded poor performance results. In [22], each 3D LN candidate produces up to 100 random 2.5D orthogonally sampled images or views which are then used to train an effective CNN model. The best performance on abdominal LN detection is achieved at 83% recall on 3FP per patient [22], using a “Cifar-10” CNN.

934,What is the number of images and classes does the ImageNet dataset have?,"Tremendous progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets (i.e. ImageNet [1, 2]) and the recent revival of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) [3, 4].For data-driven learning, large-scale well-annotated datasets with representative data distribution characteristics are crucial to learning more accurate or generalizable models [5, 4].Unlike previous image datasets used in computer vision, ImageNet [1] offers a very comprehensive database of more than 1.2 million categorized natural images of 1000+ classes.The CNN models trained upon this database serve as the backbone for significantly improving many object detection and image segmentation problems using other datasets [6, 7], e.g., PASCAL [8] and medical image categorization [9, 10, 11, 12].However, there exists no large-scale annotated medical image dataset comparable to ImageNet, as data acquisition is difficult, and quality annotation is costly. The AlexNet architecture was published in [4], achieved significantly improved performance over the other non-deep learning methods for ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012.This success has revived the interest in CNNs [3] in computer vision.ImageNet consists of 1.2 million 256\times 256 images belonging to 1000 categories.At times, the objects in the image are small and obscure, and thus pose more challenges for learning a successful classification model.More details about the ImageNet dataset will be discussed in Sec.

ImageNet [1] has more than 1.2 million 256\times 256 images categorized under 1000 object class categories.There are more than 1000 training images per class.The database is organized according to the WordNet [55] hierarchy, which currently contains only nouns in 1000 object categories.The image-object labels are obtained largely through crowd-sourcing, e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk, and human inspection.Some examples of object categories in ImageNet are “sea snake”, “sandwich”, “vase”, “leopard”, etc.ImageNet is currently the largest image dataset among other standard datasets for visual recognition.Indeed, the Caltech101, Caltech256 and Cifar10 dataset merely contain 60000 32\times 32 images and 10 object classes.Furthermore, due to the large number (1000+) of object classes, the objects belonging to each ImageNet class category can be occluded, partial and small, relative to those in the previous public image datasets.This significant intra-class variation poses greater challenges to any data-driven learning system that builds a classifier to fit given data and generalize to unseen data.For comparison, some example images of Cifar10 dataset and ImageNet images in the “tennis ball” class category are shown in Figure 7.The ImageNet dataset is publicly available, and the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) has become the standard benchmark for large-scale object recognition.",ImageNet has more than 1.2 million images and about 1000 classes.,MTL stands for Multi-Task Learning,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.480028777386304,9.36002158303973,0.0,0.004524886877828,0.217462807893753,0.2064900118293184,0.217462882399559,0.2779536843299866,0.0059115570409389,0.5,0.6862066343015715,0.7673944571701848

936,Give two examples of conventional image descriptors that can be used for object detection and segmentation in medical image analysis.,"Although natural images and medical images differ significantly, conventional image descriptors developed for object recognition in natural images, such as the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) [30] and the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) [31], have been widely used for object detection and segmentation in medical image analysis. Recently, ImageNet pre-trained CNNs have been used for chest pathology identification and detection in X-ray and CT modalities [10, 9, 12].They have yielded the best performance results by integrating low-level image features (e.g., GIST [32], bag of visual words (BoVW) and bag-of-frequency [12]).

937,What are the CNN architectures that were explored in this paper?,"We mainly explore three convolutional neural network architectures (CifarNet [5, 22], AlexNet [4] and GoogLeNet [33]) with different model training parameter values.The current deep learning models [22, 52, 53] in medical image tasks are at least 2\sim 5 orders of magnitude smaller than even AlexNet [4].More complex CNN models [22, 52] have only about 150K or 15K parameters.Roth et al. [22] adopt the CNN architecture tailored to the Cifar-10 dataset [5] and operate on image windows of 32\times 32\times 3 pixels for lymph node detection, while the simplest CNN in [54] has only one convolutional, pooling, and FC layer, respectively. We use CifarNet [5] as used in [22] as a baseline for the LN detection.AlexNet [4] and GoogLeNet [33] are also modified to evaluate these state-of-the-art CNN architecture from ImageNet classification task [2] to our CADe problems and datasets.A simplified illustration of three CNN architectures exploited is shown in Figure 5.CifarNet always takes 32\times 32\times 3 image patches as input while AlexNet and GoogLeNet are originally designed for the fixed image dimension of 256\times 256\times 3 pixels.We also reduced the filter size, stride and pooling parameters of AlexNet and GoogLeNet to accommodate a smaller input size of 64\times 64\times 3 pixels.We do so to produce and evaluate “simplified” AlexNet and GoogLeNet versions that are better suited to the smaller scale training datasets common in CADe problems.Throughout the paper, we refer to the models as CifarNet (32x32) or CifarNet (dropping 32x32); AlexNet (256x256) or AlexNet-H (high resolution); AlexNet (64x64) or AlexNet-L (low resolution); GoogLeNet (256x256) or GoogLeNet-H and GoogLeNet (64x64) or GoogLeNet-L (dropping 3 since all image inputs are three channels). The AlexNet architecture was published in [4], achieved significantly improved performance over the other non-deep learning methods for ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012.This success has revived the interest in CNNs [3] in computer vision.ImageNet consists of 1.2 million 256\times 256 images belonging to 1000 categories.At times, the objects in the image are small and obscure, and thus pose more challenges for learning a successful classification model.More details about the ImageNet dataset will be discussed in Sec. III-B.AlexNet has five convolution layers, three pooling layers, and two fully-connected layers with approximately 60 million free parameters.AlexNet is our default CNN architecture for evaluation and analysis in the remainder of the paper. In this section, we evaluate and compare the performances of nine CNN model configurations (CifarNet, AlexNet-ImNet,AlexNet-RI-H, AlexNet-TL-H, AlexNet-RI-L, GoogLeNet-RI-H, GoogLeNet-TL-H, GoogLeNet-RI-L and combined) on two important CADe problems using publicly available datasets [22, 41, 37].

GoogLeNet is the state-of-the-art deep model, which has outperformed other notable models, such as AlexNet, OverFeat, and VGGNet [67, 68] in various computer vision benchmarks. Likewise, a reasonable assumption is that OverFeat and VGGNet may generate quantitative performance results ranked between AlexNet’s and GoogLeNet’s. For completeness, we include the Overfeat and VGGNet in the following evaluations, to bolster our hypothesis.","The paper uses AlexNet, CifarNet, and GoogLeNet with various numbers of parameters.",Yes,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.101335940045618,4.576001955034213,0.0,0.0008326394671107,0.0430958233773708,0.1429052203893661,0.0430957563221454,,0.0004543384522881,,0.8852379059217138,0.7455153462817168
938,What are the computer-aided detection problems studied in this paper?,"Two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification are studied in this work. On mediastinal LN detection, we surpass all currently reported results.We obtain 86\% sensitivity on 3 false positives (FP) per patient, versus the prior state-of-art sensitivities of 78\% [36] (stacked shallow learning) and 70\% [22] (CNN), as prior state-of-the-art. For the first time, ILD classification results under the patient-level five-fold cross-validation protocol (CV5) are investigated and reported. The ILD dataset [37] contains 905 annotated image slices with 120 patients and 6 ILD labels. Such sparsely annotated datasets are generally difficult for CNN learning, due to the paucity of labeled instances. In this paper, we exploit and extensively evaluate three important, previously under-studied factors on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture, dataset characteristics, and transfer learning.We evaluate CNN performance on two different computer-aided diagnosis applications: thoraco-abdominal lymph node detection and interstitial lung disease classification.The empirical evaluation, CNN model visualization, CNN performance analysis, and conclusive insights can be generalized to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks. Until the detection aggregation approach [22, 41], thoracoabdominal lymph node (LN) detection via CADe mechanisms has yielded poor performance results. In [22], each 3D LN candidate produces up to 100 random 2.5D orthogonally sampled images or views which are then used to train an effective CNN model. The best performance on abdominal LN detection is achieved at 83\% recall on 3FP per patient [22], using a “Cifar-10” CNN.

940,What are the reasons and goals behind image sampling ?,"There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: 1) training the “CNN from scratch” [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]; 2) using “off-the-shelf CNN” features (without retraining the CNN) as complementary information channels to existing hand-crafted image features, for Chest X-rays [10] and CT lung nodule identification [9, 12]; and 3) performing unsupervised pre-training on natural or medical images and fine-tuning on medical target images using CNN or other types of deep learning models [18, 19, 20, 21].A decompositional 2.5D view resampling and an aggregation of random view classification scores are used to eliminate the “curse-of-dimensionality” issue in [22], in order to acquire a sufficient number of training image samples. Medical datasets are often “biased”, in that the number of healthy samples is much larger than the number of diseased instances, or that the numbers of images per class are uneven. In ILD dataset, the number of fibrosis samples is about 3.5 times greater than the number of emphysema samples. The number of non-LNs is 3\sim 4 times greater than the number of LNs in lymph node detection. Different sampling or resampling rates are routinely applied to both ILD and LN detection to balance the data sample number or scale per class, as in[22]. We refer this as “Equal Prior”. If we use the same sampling rate, that will lead to a “Biased Prior” across different classes. Evaluation protocols and details are critical to deriving significant empirical findings [34].Our experimental results suggest that different CNN architectures and dataset re-sampling protocols are critical for the LN detection tasks where the amount of labeled training data is sufficient and spatial contexts are local.Since LN images are more flexible than ILD images with respect to resampling and reformatting, LN datasets may be more readily augmented by such image transformations. As a result, LN datasets contain more training and testing data instances (due to data auugmentation) than ILD datasets. They nonetheless remain less comprehensive than natural image datasets, such as ImageNet.Fine-tuning ImageNet-trained models for ILD classification is clearly advantageous and yields early promising results, when the amount of labeled training data is highly insufficient and multi-class categorization is used, as opposed to the LN dataset’s binary class categorization.Another significant finding is that CNNs trained from scratch or fine-tuned from ImageNet models consistently outperform CNNs that merely use off-the-shelf CNN features, in both the LN and ILD classification problems. We further analyze, via CNN activation visualizations, when and why transfer learning from non-medical to medical images in CADe problems can be valuable.","Image sampling is useful for data augmentation to create larger datasets for training, and can also be used to balance the number of data per class during the data augmentation process.","Mask R-CNN adds a segmentation mask output, requiring pixel-to-pixel alignment, whereas Faster R-CNN only has class and bounding box outputs",0.0909090860020663,0.0,0.0454545405475211,1.4780822562194806,23.64733935011365,19.291527647196816,0.0470219435736677,0.0066225165562913,0.2424412220716476,0.4376878866800677,0.2424411922693252,0.5795496106147766,0.003799876138115,0.5,0.7491735623454421,0.7552797927997698

945,How did the authors leverage the CNN architectures designed for color images and to transfer CNN parameters pre-trained on ImageNet to be able to use it on the medical dataset ?,"To leverage the CNN architectures designed for color images and to transfer CNN parameters pre-trained on ImageNet, we transform all gray-scale axial CT slice images via three CT window ranges: lung window range [-1400, -200HU], high-attenuation range [-160, 240HU], and low-attenuation range [-1400; -950HU]. We then encode the transformed images into RGB channels (to be aligned with the input channels of CNN models [4], [33] pre-trained from natural image datasets [1]). The low-attenuation CT window is useful for visualizing certain texture patterns of lung diseases (especially emphysema). The usage of different CT attenuation channels improves classification results over the usage of a single CT windowing channel, as demonstrated in [40]. More importantly, these CT windowing processes do not depend on the lung segmentation, which instead is directly defined in the CT HU space. Figure 4 shows a representative example of lung, high-attenuation, and low-attenuation CT windowing for an axis lung CT slice.","The authors transformed every gray-scale axial CT image using the three CT windows of lung window range [-1400, -200HU], high-attenuation range [-160, 240HU], and low-attenuation range [-1400; -950HU], then encoded the transformed images into RGB images.","Yes, the β-VAE's objective controls overlap",0.0555555527777779,0.0,0.0555555527777779,0.8853994618255676,9.948795035369224,9.22312282405342,0.0222717149220489,0.0017113519680547,0.0396569594740867,0.2765401358957644,0.0396569333970546,0.3160096406936645,0.0006125984324638,0.6666666666666666,0.7599550805049367,0.7477685987398742
946,How does CNN model learns to ignore areas that appear in both healthy and diseased lungs?,"As observed in [40], lung segmentation is crucial to holistic slice-level ILD classification. We empirically compare performance in two scenarios with a rough lung segmentation111This can be achieved by segmenting the lung using simple label-fusion methods [48]. In the first case, we overlay the target image slice with the average lung mask among the training folds. In the second, we perform simple morphology operations to obtain the lung boundary. In order to retain information from the inside of the lung, we apply Gaussian smoothing to the regions outside of the lung boundary. There is no significant difference between two setups. Due to the high precision of CNN based image processing, highly accurate lung segmentation is not necessary . The localization of ILD regions within the lung is simultaneously learned through selectively weighted CNN reception fields in the deepest convolutional layers during the classification based CNN training [49, 50].Some areas outside of the lung appear in both healthy or diseased images. CNN training learns to ignore them by setting very small filter weights around the corresponding regions (Figure 13). This observation is validated by [40].",The model learns very small weights in the filters for such areas.,Monolingual and multilingual,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.646859481343467,9.4851446110076,0.0,0.0024937655860349,-0.036132026463747,0.2200226645778725,-0.036132026463747,,0.0062665499941121,,0.8131015215632962,0.712208519156258

950,What are the models that yielded the least competitive detection accuracy results on the Thoracoabdominal Lymph Node Detection?,"Results for lymph node detection in the mediastinum and abdomen are reported in Table II.FROC curves are illustrated in Figure 8.The area-under-the-FROC-curve (AUC) and true positive rate (TPR, recall or sensitivity) at three false positives per patient (TPR/3FP) are used as performance metrics.Of the nine investigated CNN models, CifarNet, AlexNet-ImNet and GoogLeNet-RI-H generally yielded the least competitive detection accuracy results.Our LN datasets are significantly more complex (i.e., display much larger within-class appearance variations), especially due to the extracted fields-of-view (FOVs) of (35mm-128mm) compared to (30mm-45mm) in [22], where CifarNet is also employed.In this experiment, CifarNet is under-trained with respect to our enhanced LN datasets, due to its limited input resolution and parameter complexity.The inferior performance of AlexNet-ImNet implies that using the pre-trained ImageNet CNNs alone as “off-the-shelf” deep image feature extractors may not be optimal or adequate for mediastinal and abdominal LN detection tasks.To complement “off-the-shelf” CNN features, [10, 9, 12] all add and integrate various other hand-crafted image features as hybrid inputs for the final CADe classification.","CifarNet, AlexNet-ImNet and GoogLeNet-RI-H were the models that had the worst results.","The key reasons behind Mask R-CNN outperforming all the winners of COCO 2015-2016 are the introduction of a third branch for object mask prediction, which requires pixel-to-pixel alignment, and the decoupling of mask and class prediction",0.0975609716835218,0.0,0.0487804838786439,0.6269916824103032,10.036232352626234,9.033199154734202,0.1219512195121951,0.0104772991850989,0.3300739228725433,0.3115191739120763,0.3300738930702209,0.069673053920269,0.0042430743344403,0.0,0.7723984290344464,0.7767907668752396
951,Why did the GoogLENet-RI-H performs poorly in the Thoracoabdominal Lymph Node Detection task?,"GoogLeNet-RI-H performs poorly, as it is susceptible to over-fitting. No sufficient data samples are available to train GoogLeNet-RI-H with random initialization.Indeed, due to GoogLeNet-RI-H’s complexity and 22-layer depth, million-image datasets may be required to properly train this model.However, GoogLeNet-TL-H significantly improves upon GoogLeNet-RI-H (0.81 versus 0.61 TPR/3FP in mediastinum; 0.70 versus 0.48 TPR/3FP in abdomen). This indicates that transfer learning offers a much better initialization of CNN parameters than random initialization. Likewise, AlexNet-TL-H consistently outperforms AlexNet-RI-H, though by smaller margins (0.81 versus 0.79 TPR/3FP in mediastinum; 0.69 versus 0.67 TPR/3FP in abdomen). This is also consistent with the findings reported for ILD detection in Table III and Figure 11.","The model suffers from over-fitting, as it is a very complex model but it does not have enough training data for training.","Based on the context provided, the uses of approximate posterior inference of the latent variable z given an observed value x for parameters θ include:

1. Efficient approximate ML or MAP estimation for the parameters θ.
2. Efficient approximate posterior inference of the latent variable z given an observed value x for a choice of parameters θ.
3. Efficient approximate marginal inference of the variable x.

These uses are relevant in computer vision applications such as image denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution, where the ability to perform efficient inference on the latent variables and the parameters of the generative model is important. Additionally, the recognition model q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) can be interpreted as a probabilistic encoder, and p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}) as a probabilistic decoder, which can be useful in coding theory and data representation tasks",0.1290322548132733,0.0,0.1075268784691872,0.0028157611171069,5.524130461405692,5.0638151985187045,0.1399491094147582,0.010132501948558,0.1707610487937927,0.6790852512763097,0.1830994337797165,0.3215464651584625,0.0126547655344621,,0.7192707063384992,0.7238311444403303
952,What is the best performing CNN model in the abdominal LN detection?,"Many of our CNN models achieve notably better (FROC-AUC and TPR/3FP) results than the previous state-of-the-art models [36] for mediastinal LN detection: GoogLeNet-RI-L obtains an AUC=0.95 and 0.85 TPR/3FP, versus AUC=0.92 and 0.70 TPR/3FP [22] and 0.78 TPR/3FP [36] which uses stacked shallow learning.This difference lies in the fact that annotated lymph node segmentation masks are required to learn a mid-level semantic boundary detector [36], whereas CNN approaches only need LN locations for training [22]. In abdominal LN detection, [22] obtains the best trade-off between its CNN model complexity and sampled data configuration. Our best performing CNN model is GoogLeNet-TL (256x256) which obtains an AUC=0.92 and 0.70 TPR/3FP.",The best performing model is GoogLeNet-TL.,"Sure! Here's my answer:

These numbers represent the perplexity of the language model on the holdout data set, which is a common measure of progress in language modeling. In this case, a lower perplexity value indicates a better fit of the model to the data, and a value of 51.3 or 30.0 would indicate that the model is performing well on the given task",0.1132075451619793,0.0298507448875028,0.0754716961053756,0.0019276240779694,6.54195506943515,6.000628723158686,0.318200663349917,0.0103828682673588,0.0448203161358833,0.6159164644881543,0.0483471155166626,0.5980107188224792,0.0124161441487691,,0.7156586678387754,0.7635263415184983
953,What is the difference between five-fold cross validation and leave-one-patient out?,"To investigate the performance difference between five-fold cross-validation (CV) in Sec. IV-B and leave-one-patient-out (LOO) validation, this experiment is performed under the LOO protocol. By comparing results in Table III (CV-5) to those in Table VI (LOO), one can see that LOO’s quantitative performances are remarkably better than CV-5’s. For example, in ILD slice-level classification, the accuracy level drastically increases from 0.46 to 0.867 using AlexNet-TL, and from 0.57 to 0.902 for GoogLeNet-TL.",LOO performs better than five-fold cross validation.,The authors used a distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approach for training the distilled models,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.39665050470507,7.047487878528804,0.0,0.0099009900990099,0.15422223508358,0.3237391114234924,0.1542222946882248,0.1656600534915924,0.0025965842570211,0.6666666666666666,0.7360027042746017,0.7549283977990646
954,How is the original ILD images were reconstructed ?,"The last pooling layer (pool-5) activation maps of the ImageNet pre-trained AlexNet [4] (analogical to AlexNet-ImNet) and AlexNet-TL, obtained by processing two input images of Figure 2 (b,c), are shown in Figure 13 (a,b). The last pooling layer activation map summarizes the entire input image by highlighting which relative locations or neural reception fields relative to the image are activated. There are a total of 256 (6x6) reception fields in AlexNet [4]. Pooling units where the relative image location of the disease region is present in the image are highlighted with green boxes. Next, we reconstruct the original ILD images using the process of de-convolution, back-propagating with convolution and un-pooling from the activation maps of the chosen pooling units [72]. From the reconstructed images (Figure 13 bottom), we observe that with fine-tuning, AlexNet-TL detects and localizes objects of interest (ILD disease regions depicted in in Figure 2 (b) and (c)) better than AlexNet-ImNet. The filters shown in Figure 13 that better localize regions on the input images (Figure 2 (b) and (c)) respectively, produce relatively higher activations (in the top 5%) among all 512 reception field responses in the fine-tuned AlexNet-TL model. As observed in [73], the final CNN classification score can not be driven solely by a single strong activation in the receptions fields, but often by a sparse set of high activations (i.e., varying selective or sparse activations per input image).","A process consisting of deconvolution, back-propagation with convolution, and un-pooling from the activation maps of the pooling units was used to reconstruct the original ILD images.","Through cross-attention layers that produce spatial attention maps for each textual token, the embeddings of visual and textual features are fused during the noise prediction process",0.2127659524490721,0.0,0.0851063779809871,2.09293736351962,24.73832040060316,21.749034846405817,0.1215277777777777,0.0111779879621668,0.197632223367691,0.4549604306559381,0.197632223367691,0.5555840134620667,0.0036597231556469,0.0,0.7644962594369668,0.7989322878208794
955,Was Transfer learning beneficial on the CADe process? ,"While it is a more practical CADe scheme, slice-level CNN learning [40] is very challenging, as it is restricted to only 905 CT image slices with tagged ILD labels. We only benchmark the slice-level ILD classification results in this section. Even with the help of data augmentation (described in Sec. II), the classification accuracy of GoogLeNet-TL from Table III is only 0.57. However, transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained model is consistently beneficial, as evidenced by AlexNet-TL (0.46) versus AlexNet-RI (0.44), and GoogLeNet-TL (0.57) versus GoogLeNet-RI (0.41). It especially prevents GoogLeNet from over-fitting on the limited CADe datasets. Finally, when the cross-validation is conducted by randomly splitting the set of all 905 CT axial slices into five folds, markedly higher F-scores are obtained (Slice-Random in Table IV). This further validates the claim that the dataset poorly generalizes ILDs for different patients. Figure 10 shows examples of misclassified ILD patches (in axial view), with their ground truth labels and inaccurately classified labels. •Deep CNN architectures with 8, even 22 layers [4, 33], can be useful even for CADe problems where the available training datasets are limited. Previously, CNN models used in medical image analysis applications have often been 2\sim 5 orders of magnitude smaller.•The trade-off between using better learning models and using more training data [51] should be carefully considered when searching for an optimal solution to any CADe problem (e.g., mediastinal and abdominal LN detection).•Limited datasets can be a bottleneck to further advancement of CADe.

Our method uses a very deep convolutional network inspired by VGG-net used for ImageNet classification [19]. We find increasing our network depth shows a significant improvement in accuracy. Our final model uses 20 weight layers. By cascading small filters many times in a deep network structure, contextual information over large image regions is exploited in an efficient way. With very deep networks, however, convergence speed becomes a critical issue during training. We propose a simple yet effective training procedure.

958,Did increasing the network depth improved the results?,"However, we argue that increasing depth significantly boosts performance. We successfully use 20 weight layers (3\times 3 for each layer). Our network is very deep (20 vs. 3 [6]) and information used for reconstruction (receptive field) is much larger (41\times 41 vs. 13\times 13). In this section, we study three properties of our proposed method. First, we show that large depth is necessary for the task of SR. A very deep network utilizes more contextual information in an image and models complex functions with many nonlinear layers. We experimentally verify that deeper networks give better performances than shallow ones. We now experimentally show that very deep networks significantly improve SR performance. We train and test networks of depth ranging from 5 to 20 (only counting weight layers excluding nonlinearity layers). In Figure 3, we show the results. In most cases, performance increases as depth increases. As depth increases, performance improves rapidly. In this work, we have presented a super-resolution method using very deep networks. Training a very deep network is hard due to a slow convergence rate. We use residual-learning and extremely high learning rates to optimize a very deep network fast. Convergence speed is maximized and we use gradient clipping to ensure the training stability. We have demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing method by a large margin on benchmarked images. We believe our approach is readily applicable to other image restoration problems such as denoising and compression artifact removal.","Yes, it did boost performance.","Sure!

959,What is the issue that come with very deep networks?,"One problem with using a very deep network to predict dense outputs is that the size of the feature map gets reduced every time convolution operations are applied. For example, when an input of size (n+1)\times(n+1) is applied to a network with receptive field size n\times n, the output image is 1\times 1. High Learning Rates for Very Deep NetworksTraining deep models can fail to converge in realistic limit of time. SRCNN [6] fails to show superior performance with more than three weight layers. While there can be various reasons, one possibility is that they stopped their training procedure before networks converged. Their learning rate 10^{-5} is too small for a network to converge within a week on a common GPU. Looking at Fig. 9 of [6], it is not easy to say their deeper networks have converged and their performances were saturated. While more training will eventually resolve the issue, but increasing depth to 20 does not seems practical with SRCNN. Multi-Scale While very deep models can boost performance, more parameters are now needed to define a network. Typically, one network is created for each scale factor. Considering that fractional scale factors are often used, we need an economical way to store and retrieve networks. In this work, we have presented a super-resolution method using very deep networks. Training a very deep network is hard due to a slow convergence rate. We use residual-learning and extremely high learning rates to optimize a very deep network fast.

Neighbor embedding [4, 15] methods interpolate the patch subspace. Sparse coding [25, 26, 21, 22] methods use a learned compact dictionary based on sparse signal representation.

963,What are the limitations of the SRCNN in the SISR task?,"Scale As in most existing SR methods, SRCNN is trained for a single scale factor and is supposed to work only with the specified scale. Thus, if a new scale is on demand, a new model has to be trained. To cope with multiple scale SR (possibly including fractional factors), we need to construct individual single scale SR system for each scale of interest. While SRCNN successfully introduced a deep learning technique into the super-resolution (SR) problem, we find its limitations in three aspects: first, it relies on the context of small image regions; second, training converges too slowly; third, the network only works for a single scale. We provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Compared methods are A+ [22], RFL[18], SelfEx [11] and SRCNN [5]. In Table 3, we provide a summary of quantitative evaluation on several datasets.

964,How did the authors speed up the training?,"It is a basic rule of thumb to make learning rate high to boost training. But simply setting learning rate high can also lead to vanishing/exploding gradients [2]. For the reason, we suggest an adjustable gradient clipping for maximal boost in speed while suppressing exploding gradients. For maximal speed of convergence, we clip the gradients to [-\frac{\theta}{\gamma},\frac{\theta}{\gamma}], where \gamma denotes the current learning rate. We find the adjustable gradient clipping makes our convergence procedure extremely fast. Our 20-layer network training is done within 4 hours whereas 3-layer SRCNN takes several days to train. Convergence We suggest a way to speed-up the training: residual-learning CNN and extremely high learning rates. As LR image and HR image share the same information to a large extent, explicitly modelling the residual image, which is the difference between HR and LR images, is advantageous. We propose a network structure for efficient learning when input and output are highly correlated. Moreover, our initial learning rate is 10^{4} times higher than that of SRCNN [6]. This is enabled by residual-learning and gradient clipping.","The authors used residual learning, extremely high learning rates, and adjustable gradient clipping.","The local model only considers entity links as potential antecedents for a mention span, while the global model uses bidirectional connections between mentions to overcome the limitation of the local model",0.0512820468376072,0.0,0.0512820468376072,1.0699102941148824,11.447027406028225,9.453327164142149,0.0852272727272727,0.0102276476410425,-0.0063677597790956,0.4042640804640345,-0.0063677043654024,0.3277575671672821,0.0064105762210419,0.0,0.7548106919860459,0.7599247234682497

Thus, if a new scale is on demand, a new model has to be trained. To cope with multiple scale SR (possibly including fractional factors), we need to construct individual single scale SR system for each scale of interest. However, preparing many individual machines for all possible scenarios to cope with multiple scales is inefficient and impractical.In this work, we design and train a single network to handle multiple scale SR problem efficiently. This turns out to work very well. Our single machine is compared favorably to a single-scale expert for the given sub-task. For three scales factors (×2,3,4\times 2,3,4× 2 , 3 , 4), we can reduce the number of parameters by three-fold. Scale Factor We propose a single-model SR approach. Scales are typically user-specified and can be arbitrary including fractions. For example, one might need smooth zoom-in in an image viewer or resizing to a specific dimension. Training and storing many scale-dependent models in preparation for all possible scenarios is impractical. We find a single convolutional network is sufficient for multi-scale-factor super-resolution. Contribution In summary, in this work, we propose a highly accurate SR method based on a very deep convolutional network. Very deep networks converge too slowly if small learning rates are used. Boosting convergence rate with high learning rates lead to exploding gradients and we resolve the issue with residual-learning and gradient clipping. In addition, we extend our work to cope with multi-scale SR problem in a single network. Our method is relatively accurate and fast in comparison to state-of-the-art methods as illustrated in Figure 1.","Existing methods are only trained for a single scale, so adapting them to other scales requires retraining.

First, white noise has a flat power spectral density, which means it contains equal amounts of power at all frequencies. This allows the network to learn more generalizable features that are less sensitive to specific frequencies or patterns in the data. In contrast, Salt-and-pepper noise has a high frequency component that may not be desirable for certain tasks. Gaussian noise, on the other hand, has a heavy tail, which may make it more difficult to train the network.

Second, white noise is a more efficient choice because it has a lower variance than other types of noise. This means that the network needs to be trained on less data to achieve the same level of performance, which can reduce the risk of overfitting.

Finally, white noise is a more convenient choice because it is easy to generate and manipulate. It can be sampled from a uniform distribution, which makes it easy to control the amount of noise added to the network.

969,What are the reasons of using residual learning ?,"Residual-Learning In SRCNN, the exact copy of the input has to go through all layers until it reaches the output layer. With many weight layers, this becomes an end-to-end relation requiring very long-term memory. For this reason, the vanishing/exploding gradients problem [2] can be critical. We can solve this problem simply with residual-learning. Second, we show that our residual-learning network converges much faster than the standard CNN. Moreover, our network gives a significant boost in performance. First, we find that this residual network converges much faster. Two networks are compared experimentally: the residual network and the standard non-residual network. We use depth 10 (weight layers) and scale factor 2. Performance curves for various learning rates are shown in Figure 4. All use the same learning rate scheduling mechanism that has been mentioned above. Second, at convergence, the residual network shows superior performance. In Figure 4, residual networks give higher PSNR when training is done. Another remark is that if small learning rates are used, networks do not converge in the given number of epochs. If initial learning rate 0.1 is used, PSNR of a residual-learning network reaches 36.90 within 10 epochs. But if 0.001 is used instead, the network never reaches the same level of performance (its performance is 36.52 after 80 epochs). In a similar manner, residual and non-residual networks show dramatic performance gaps after 10 epochs (36.90 vs. 27.42 for rate 0.1).","Residual learning solves the vanishing/exploding gradients problem, allowing for the model to converge faster and perform better.","Sure!

972,What is gradient clipping?,"Adjustable Gradient ClippingGradient clipping is a technique that is often used in training recurrent neural networks [17]. But, to our knowledge, its usage is limited in training CNNs. While there exist many ways to limit gradients, one of the common strategies is to clip individual gradients to the predefined range[-\theta,\theta]. With clipping, gradients are in a certain range. With stochastic gradient descent commonly used for training, learning rate is multiplied to adjust the step size. If high learning rate is used, it is likely that \theta is tuned to be small to avoid exploding gradients in a high learning rate regime. But as learning rate is annealed to get smaller, the effective gradient (gradient multiplied by learning rate) approaches zero and training can take exponentially many iterations to converge if learning rate is decreased geometrically.",Gradient clipping is a technique often used in training RNNs that alters hyperparameters such that the gradients are always within a certain range.,Zalando is Europe's largest online fashion platform,0.0714285676785716,0.0,0.0714285676785716,1.5732934811145336,13.169524562333264,11.090233201394351,0.0223214285714285,0.0031717263253285,-0.0302455183118581,0.3264125185353413,-0.030245529487729,0.1289099752902984,0.0023043699534299,,0.7043175849361445,0.6787047190972013

974,What was the goal behind train a multi-scale model ?,"Scale As in most existing SR methods, SRCNN is trained for a single scale factor and is supposed to work only with the specified scale. Thus, if a new scale is on demand, a new model has to be trained. To cope with multiple scale SR (possibly including fractional factors), we need to construct individual single scale SR system for each scale of interest. However, preparing many individual machines for all possible scenarios to cope with multiple scales is inefficient and impractical.In this work, we design and train a single network to handle multiple scale SR problem efficiently. This turns out to work very well. Our single machine is compared favorably to a single-scale expert for the given sub-task. For three scales factors (×2,3,4\times 2,3,4× 2 , 3 , 4), we can reduce the number of parameters by three-fold. For this reason, we also train a multi-scale model. With this approach, parameters are shared across all predefined scale factors. Training a multi-scale model is straightforward. Training datasets for several specified scales are combined into one big dataset. Third, we show that our method with a single network performs as well as a method using multiple networks trained for each scale. We can effectively reduce model capacity (the number of parameters) of multi-network approaches. Scale Factor We propose a single-model SR approach. Scales are typically user-specified and can be arbitrary including fractions. For example, one might need smooth zoom-in in an image viewer or resizing to a specific dimension. Training and storing many scale-dependent models in preparation for all possible scenarios is impractical. We find a single convolutional network is sufficient for multi-scale-factor super-resolution.","Single-scale models can only be used for one scale, so a new model must be trained for new scales.

978,What is the key difference between inductive and transductive learning?,"Inductive transfer learning has had a large impact on computer vision (CV). Applied CV models (including object detection, classification, and segmentation) are rarely trained from scratch, but instead are fine-tuned from models that have been pretrained on ImageNet, MS-COCO, and other datasets Sharif Razavian et al. (2014); Long et al. (2015a); He et al. (2016); Huang et al. (2017). We are interested in the most general inductive transfer learning setting for NLP Pan and Yang (2010): Given a static source task \mathcal{T}_{S} and any target task \mathcal{T}_{T} with \mathcal{T}_{S}\neq\mathcal{T}_{T}, we would like to improve performance on \mathcal{T}_{T}. Language modeling can be seen as the ideal source task and a counterpart of ImageNet for NLP: It captures many facets of language relevant for downstream tasks, such as long-term dependencies Linzen et al. (2016), hierarchical relations Gulordava et al. (2018), and sentiment Radford et al. (2017). In contrast to tasks like MT McCann et al. (2017) and entailment Conneau et al. (2017), it provides data in near-unlimited quantities for most domains and languages. Additionally, a pretrained LM can be easily adapted to the idiosyncrasies of a target task, which we show significantly improves performance (see Section 5). Moreover, language modeling already is a key component of existing tasks such as MT and dialogue modeling. Formally, language modeling induces a hypothesis space \mathcal{H} that should be useful for many other NLP tasks Vapnik and Kotz (1982); Baxter (2000). While Deep Learning models have achieved state-of-the-art on many NLP tasks, these models are trained from scratch, requiring large datasets, and days to converge. Research in NLP focused mostly on transductive transfer Blitzer et al. (2007). For inductive transfer, fine-tuning pretrained word embeddings Mikolov et al. (2013), a simple transfer technique that only targets a model’s first layer, has had a large impact in practice and is used in most state-of-the-art models. Recent approaches that concatenate embeddings derived from other tasks with the input at different layers Peters et al. (2017); McCann et al. (2017); Peters et al. (2018) still train the main task model from scratch and treat pretrained embeddings as fixed parameters, limiting their usefulness.","General inductive transfer learning is, given a static source task and any target task where the source task and target task are not equal, to improve the performance of the target task. This occurs by fine-tuning a model that has been pretrained on other datasets. What transductive transfer learning is and the difference between transductive and inductive transfer learning cannot be answered from this paper.","A significant tradeoff in accuracy is expected when basic network architectures are represented in low-bit computations, as the reduced precision can lead to loss of information and increased error rates",0.1621621573959095,0.0,0.1351351303688825,0.839647124413334,25.06078180637437,21.05716826025297,0.0746268656716418,0.0048939641109298,0.1280925720930099,0.4227839601668567,0.1873070895671844,0.3587940633296966,0.0096659825266338,,0.7559699516837166,0.7433230864811069
979,What is catastrophic forgetting?,"Fine-tuning the target classifier is the most critical part of the transfer learning method. Overly aggressive fine-tuning will cause catastrophic forgetting, eliminating the benefit of the information captured through language modeling; too cautious fine-tuning will lead to slow convergence (and resultant overfitting). Besides discriminative fine-tuning and triangular learning rates, we propose gradual unfreezing for fine-tuning the classifier. We show that not the idea of LM fine-tuning but our lack of knowledge of how to train them effectively has been hindering wider adoption. LMs overfit to small datasets and suffered catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned with a classifier. Compared to CV, NLP models are typically more shallow and thus require different fine-tuning methods. On all datasets, fine-tuning the full model leads to the lowest error comparatively early in training, e.g. already after the first epoch on IMDb. The error then increases as the model starts to overfit and knowledge captured through pretraining is lost. In contrast, ULMFiT is more stable and suffers from no such catastrophic forgetting; performance remains similar or improves until late epochs, which shows the positive effect of the learning rate schedule.",Catastrophic forgetting involved increasing error as a model start to overfit and knowledge captured through pretraining is lost.,"Sure!

980,"What does ""MT domains"" mean? ","Hypercolumns In NLP, only recently have methods been proposed that go beyond transferring word embeddings. The prevailing approach is to pretrain embeddings that capture additional context via other tasks. Embeddings at different levels are then used as features, concatenated either with the word embeddings or with the inputs at intermediate layers. This method is known as hypercolumns (Hariharan et al., 2015) in CV2 and is used by Peters et al. (2017), Peters et al. (2018), Wieting and Gimpel (2017), Conneau et al. (2017), and McCann et al. (2017) who use language modeling, paraphrasing, entailment, and Machine Translation (MT) respectively for pretraining. Specifically, Peters et al. (2018) require engineered custom architectures, while we show state-of-the-art performance with the same basic architecture across a range of tasks. In CV, hypercolumns have been nearly entirely superseded by end-to-end fine-tuning (Long et al., 2015a).",MT stands for Machine Translation.,"Sure! Here's my answer:

981,What metrics are used to compare the performance of ULMFiT against existing approaches?,"In order to assess the impact of each contribution, we perform a series of analyses and ablations. We run experiments on three corpora, IMDb, TREC-6, and AG that are representative of different tasks, genres, and sizes. For all experiments, we split off 10\% of the training set and report error rates on this validation set with unidirectional LMs. We fine-tune the classifier for 50 epochs and train all methods but ULMFiT with early stopping. Our contributions are the following: 1) We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), a method that can be used to achieve CV-like transfer learning for any task for NLP. 2) We propose discriminative fine-tuning, slanted triangular learning rates, and gradual unfreezing, novel techniques to retain previous knowledge and avoid catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. 3) We significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on six representative text classification datasets, with an error reduction of 18-24% on the majority of datasets. 4) We show that our method enables extremely sample-efficient transfer learning and perform an extensive ablation analysis. 5) We make the pretrained models and our code available to enable wider adoption. For consistency, we report all results as error rates (lower is better). We show the test error rates on the IMDb and TREC-6 datasets used by McCann et al. (2017) in Table 2. Our method outperforms both CoVe, a state-of-the-art transfer learning method based on hypercolumns, as well as the state-of-the-art on both datasets. On IMDb, we reduce the error dramatically by 43.9% and 22% with regard to CoVe and the state-of-the-art respectively. This is promising as the existing state-of-the-art requires complex architectures (Peters et al., 2018), multiple forms of attention (McCann et al., 2017) and sophisticated embedding schemes (Johnson and Zhang, 2016), while our method employs a regular LSTM with dropout. We note that the language model fine-tuning approach of Dai and Le (2015) only achieves an error of 7.64 vs. 4.6 for our method on IMDb, demonstrating the benefit of transferring knowledge from a large ImageNet-like corpus using our fine-tuning techniques. IMDb in particular is reflective of real world datasets: Its documents are generally a few paragraphs long—similar to emails (e.g for legal discovery) and online comments (e.g for community management); and sentiment analysis is similar to many commercial applications, e.g. product response tracking and support email routing.","For consistency, the authors reported all results as error rates where lower is better.","No, NASNets does not perform better than MobileNet and ShuffleNet under resource-constrained settings",0.0740740690809331,0.0,0.0740740690809331,2.908317710573757,18.752910760303227,15.823915090927947,0.0632911392405063,0.0092002830856334,0.1646144241094589,0.2010281793948894,0.1646144688129425,0.2176017016172409,0.0028788587025897,,0.7846795443812922,0.7448106745625775
982,Does the proposed approach in the paper require a labelled dataset?,"One of the main benefits of transfer learning is being able to train a model for a task with a small number of labels. We evaluate ULMFiT on different numbers of labeled examples in two settings: only labeled examples are used for LM fine-tuning (‘supervised’); and all task data is available and can be used to fine-tune the LM (‘semi-supervised’). We compare ULMFiT to training from scratch—which is necessary for hypercolumn-based approaches. We split off balanced fractions of the training data, keep the validation set fixed, and use the same hyperparameters as before. We show the results in Figure 3. We propose Universal Language Model Finetuning (ULMFiT), which pretrains a language model (LM) on a large general-domain corpus and fine-tunes it on the target task using novel techniques.

983,How well do the proposed model in this paper and the model in Dai and Lee (2015) generalize to documents of varying lengths?,"We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), which pretrains a language model (LM) on a large general-domain corpus and fine-tunes it on the target task using novel techniques. The method is universal in the sense that it meets these practical criteria: 1) It works across tasks varying in document size, number, and label type; 2) it uses a single architecture and training process; 3) it requires no custom feature engineering or preprocessing; and 4) it does not require additional in-domain documents or labels. We evaluate our method on six widely-studied datasets, with varying numbers of documents and varying document length, used by state-of-the-art text classification and transfer learning approaches Johnson and Zhang (2017); McCann et al. (2017) as instances of three common text classification tasks: sentiment analysis, question classification, and topic classification. We show the statistics for each dataset and task in Table 1. For consistency, we report all results as error rates (lower is better). We show the test error rates on the IMDb and TREC-6 datasets used by McCann et al. (2017) in Table 2. Our method outperforms both CoVe, a state-of-the-art transfer learning method based on hypercolumns, as well as the state-of-the-art on both datasets. On IMDb, we reduce the error dramatically by 43.9% and 22% with regard to CoVe and the state-of-the-art respectively. This is promising as the existing state-of-the-art requires complex architectures Peters et al. (2018), multiple forms of attention McCann et al.

We note that the language model fine-tuning approach of Dai and Le (2015) only achieves an error of 7.64 vs. 4.6 for our method on IMDb, demonstrating the benefit of transferring knowledge from a large ImageNet-like corpus using our fine-tuning techniques. IMDb in particular is reflective of real-world datasets: Its documents are generally a few paragraphs long—similar to emails (e.g for legal discovery) and online comments (e.g for community management); and sentiment analysis is similar to many commercial applications, e.g. product response tracking and support email routing. We propose a new method, Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) that addresses these issues and enables robust inductive transfer learning for any NLP task, akin to fine-tuning ImageNet models: The same 3-layer LSTM architecture—with the same hyperparameters and no additions other than tuned dropout hyperparameters—outperforms highly engineered models and transfer learning approaches on six widely studied text classification tasks. On IMDb, with 100 labeled examples, ULMFiT matches the performance of training from scratch with 10×10\times10 × and—given 50k unlabeled examples—with 100×100\times100 × more data.","This work’s method was evaluated in six widely-studied datasets which varied in document length and experimental results demonstrated that the method outperformed existing approaches in all of these datasets.

Note that the parameters in these task-specific classifier layers are the only ones that are learned from scratch. The first linear layer takes as the input the pooled last hidden layer states.

Note that despite pretraining on more than two orders of magnitude less data than the 7 million sentence pairs used by McCann et al.

The results are shown in Table 2.","Facial recognition (FR) techniques can be broadly classified into traditional and deep learning-based methods. Traditional methods include local-feature-based FR, which uses handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and holistic approaches, which derive a low-dimensional representation of the face through certain distribution assumptions. These methods have been shown to be effective in controlled environments but struggle with uncontrolled facial changes, such as lighting, pose, expression, and disguise.

Deep learning-based methods, on the other hand, have shown promising results in addressing these challenges. These methods use neural networks to learn a robust representation of the face, which can be more effective in real-world applications. DeepFace, a 9-layer model trained on 4 million facial images, achieved SOTA accuracy on the LFW benchmark in 2014, and subsequent deep learning-based methods have further improved the accuracy to above 99.80% in just three years.

However, despite the progress made by deep learning-based methods, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as privacy concerns and the need for better understanding of the ""identity capacity"" of deep representations. Additionally, deep learning-based methods require large amounts of training data, which can be difficult to obtain in real-world applications.

","We propose a new method, Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) that addresses these issues and enables robust inductive transfer learning for any NLP task, akin to fine-tuning ImageNet models: The same 3-layer LSTM architecture—with the same hyperparameters and no additions other than tuned dropout hyperparameters—outperforms highly engineered models and transfer learning approaches on six widely studied text classification tasks. On IMDb, with 100 labeled examples, ULMFiT matches the performance of training from scratch with 10×10\times10 × and—given 50k unlabeled examples—with 100×100\times100 × more data. Our contributions are the following: 1) We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), a method that can be used to achieve CV-like transfer learning for any task for NLP. 2) We propose discriminative fine-tuning, slanted triangular learning rates, and gradual unfreezing, novel techniques to retain previous knowledge and avoid catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. 3) We significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on six representative text classification datasets, with an error reduction of 18-24% on the majority of datasets. 4) We show that our method enables extremely sample-efficient transfer learning and perform an extensive ablation analysis. 5) We make the pretrained models and our code available to enable wider adoption.

Using the same learning rate (LR) or an annealed learning rate throughout training is not the best way to achieve this behaviour.Instead, we propose slanted triangular learning rates (STLR), which first linearly increases the learning rate and then linearly decays it according to the following update schedule, which can be seen in Figure 2:\begin{split}cut&=\lfloor T\cdot cut\_frac\rfloor\\p&=\begin{cases}t/cut,&\text{if}\ t<cut\\1-\frac{t-cut}{cut\cdot(1/cut\_frac-1)},&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\\\eta_{t}&=\eta_{max}\cdot\frac{1+p\cdot(ratio-1)}{ratio}\end{split}(3)where T is the number of training iterations555In other words, the number of epochs times the number of updates per epoch., cut\_frac is the fraction of iterations we increase the LR, cut is the iteration when we switch from increasing to decreasing the LR, p is the fraction of the number of iterations we have increased or will decrease the LR respectively, ratio specifies how much smaller the lowest LR is from the maximum LR \eta_{max}, and \eta_{t} is the learning rate at iteration t.

1004,What are some other approaches for semantic similarity and how do they differ to Sentence Transformers in architecture and performance?,"A retrieved past feedback that is incorrect might cause the model to make a mistake, thus necessitating a good retrieval function. We propose a two-stage method for effective retrieval involving: transforming \mathbf{x}, followed by a similarity lookup of the transformed \mathbf{x} in \mathcal{M}. When the task involves high surface-level similarity among past feedback, such as in lexical word tasks, then a simple heuristic-based transformation is sufficient.However, such simple transformations are insufficient for tasks that involves more complex retrieval e.g., when two lexically dissimilar situations can share the same understanding.For example, consider two situations from ert-nl: Filling a false time sheet at work and Being at a party, and telling parents I am studying.These situations look lexically dissimilar but correspond to the same underlying social principle lying to authority.In our experiments, off-the-shelf methods failed to address these challenges (see §4 later). After the transformation stage, the closest matching entry is then used as the corresponding \mathbf{fb}. Transformation reduces \mathcal{M}(\mathbf{x}) to a search over \mathbf{fb}_{1},\mathbf{fb}_{2},\ldots,\mathbf{fb}_{|\mathcal{M}|} with \hat{\mathbf{fb}} as the search query. We compute similarity based on a fine-tuned Sentence transformers (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). To address these challenges with transformation in complex tasks, we have designed a novel SEQ 2 SEQ based transformation called GUD - IR. Given x, GUD - IR generates a transformed feedback fb for x using a generative SEQ 2 SEQ model. Our approach is inspired and supported by the recent success of generate and retrieve (Mao et al., 2021) methods. However, despite the similarity, the methods have different goals: Mao et al. (2021) leverage generative models for query expansion, whereas our goal is explainable input understanding. See Appendix B for more details on GUD - IR.","The authors mention that they experiment with using a sentence transformer (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) and a custom Seq2Seq model called GUD-IR for their retrieval function.

1005,How accurate or correct was their few-shot approach to making GPT-3 verbalize its understanding?,"We operationalize this idea by including task verbalization in the prompt (Fig. 3).Given a question What sounds like < sighted > ?, a vanilla prompting approach will generate the answer cited.In contrast, we include a \mathbf{u} the homophone for in the prompt.gpt-3 is adept at reasoning with just a handful of examples, and thus can be expected to mimic the prompt to generate task understanding and answer.gpt-3 generates such additional information in all our tasks.Given a test question What sounds similar to < sighted > ?, if the model generates the word that has the same meaning as \mathbf{u}, the user has a reason to believe that the answer is wrong. Figure 1 presents a sample interaction between a user and gpt-3 that our setup enables.The model was asked for a similar word. However, the model’s (incorrect) task understanding \mathbf{u} was “The homophone of good is”.The user can detect such discrepancy between the intended and interpreted task instruction, and can provide feedback \mathbf{fb} as ""similar to means with a similar meaning"", clarifying that they actually wanted a synonym.Crucially, note that such instructional correction is feasible even if the user does not knowthe correct answer to their question, as they are critiquing the model’s understanding of theirintent, rather than the answers themselves.Thus, our setup does not require the users to be experts at tasks being solved, another advantage of our approach. We present \ours, a novel, memory-enhanced gpt-3 that allows users to interact and improve the model without retraining. A key insight is to have the model articulate not just its answer but also its understanding of the user’s intent, providing an avenue for feedback.We show that deployed systems with fixed large-language models can still be improved by interacting with end-users, potentially improving their performance and broadening their utility. In Tandon et al. (2022), we show that using a memory of user feedback can be used to repair erroneous model in a supervised setting.In this work, we build upon the recent advances in few-shot prompting to modify gpt-3’s behavior by adding user feedback to the query (prompt).Like others, we use gpt-3 with few-shot prompting, where the prompt consistsof a prefix prefix containing a few input-output “training” examples of the task, followed by the input x, e.g., a question,to operate on. However, while prior work has focused on constructing better prefixes, e.g., dynamically selecting good “training” examplesbased on the question Le Scao and Rush (2021); Liu et al. (2021a), or even representing the prefix latently Li and Liang (2021),our work elaborates the input x itself to clarify the intended task, by adding user feedback fb from previous misunderstandings.","The authors mention in multiple places how their iterative correction/feedback process depends on GPT verbalizing it's thinking process or understanding of the user's inputs or needs.

1007,Why does the approach need a gating mechanism when a good retrieval should be able to correctly filter out irrelevant feedback from the memory?,": A gating function allowing irrelevant, retrieved feedback to be ignored. A retrieved past feedback that is incorrect might cause the model to make a mistake, thus necessitating a good retrieval function. We propose a two-stage method for effective retrieval involving: transforming \mathbf{x}, followed by a similarity lookup of the transformed \mathbf{x} in \mathcal{M}. When the task involves high surface-level similarity among past feedback, such as in lexical word tasks, then a simple heuristic-based transformation is sufficient.However, such simple transformations are insufficient for tasks that involves more complex retrieval e.g., when two lexically dissimilar situations can share the same understanding.For example, consider two situations from ert-nl: Filling a false time sheet at work and Being at a party, and telling parents I am studying.These situations look lexically dissimilar but correspond to the same underlying social principle lying to authority.In our experiments, off-the-shelf methods failed to address these challenges (see §4 later). Extending the discussion on noise in feedback, our setting assumes that users will not provide any adversarial feedback. However, in real-world environments, this assumption is unlikely to hold. Additionally, there is a risk in the real-world deployment of our system, wherein an adversarial user might provide harmful feedback, thus maliciously controlling the systems (potentially a home-based robot) where our method is deployed. Thus, robust mechanisms such as gud-ir and memory adapters will be critical for successful real-world deployments.","A gating function is needed precisely because the retrieval function might not be able to filter out irrelevant feedback from memory. This is a challenging thing to implement since syntactically or lexically similar things might or might not refer to similar concepts. Another challenge is with adversarial feedback, made by users intending to mess with the system. It is true that a gating function in the combiner would not be required if the retrieval function was near perfect at eliminating irrelevant feedback. Regardless, some form of filtering has to be done at some stage - whether it's in the lookup/retrieval function or in the combiner function does not specifically matter, but the existence of a filtering mechanism is crucial for MemPrompt-like systems to work.","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

No.

Using more epochs during training does not necessarily increase the validation accuracy. In fact, overfitting can occur if the model is trained for too many epochs, which can negatively impact the validation accuracy. In this case, the optimal hyperparameters were already identified through grid search, and further increasing the number of epochs may not improve the model's performance",0.1159420241125815,0.0220994428509518,0.1014492704893932,1.142455806512895,29.13623314350126,25.03559246919319,0.1094605160281469,0.0061895214017958,0.072777010500431,0.4836023342596837,0.1496019557118415,0.4578382074832916,0.0120932166855883,0.4,0.7684891837293626,0.7077190172467358

If the model gives a wrong answer to query \mathbf{x}, then \mathbf{fb} is used as the simulated corrective feedback.The sources for these datasets are listed in Appendix  §E. The lexical relation task is to predict a word with a given lexical relationship to an input word.We use five relationships: synonym (syn), antonym (ant), homophone (hom), definition (defn), and sentence usage generation (sent).","The five kinds of lexical question-and-answer tasks that the authors mention are: synonyms, antonyms, homophones, definitions and sentence usage generation. An example of a synonym task could be ""what is a word that has the same meaning as encumbrance"".","Using relative encoding compared to absolute encoding can provide several advantages, such as:

* Incorporating positional information into the self-attention mechanism, allowing the model to capture relative relationships between nodes on the graph.
* Distinguishing between true and created edges, as in the case of SAN (Kreuzer et al., 2021).
* Allowing for the incorporation of structural information into the graph Transformer, as in the case of centrality measures and shortest path distances (Ying et al., 2021).

1011,How did they edit the prompt based on previous examples? Was it by editing the original text of the prompt or simply by concatenating the examples?,"In our setup, given an input \mathbf{x}, a model generates an output \mathbf{y} and a sentence \mathbf{u} expressing its understanding of the task, a skill learned through few-shot examples in theprompt (Appendix D).The user can then critique \mathbf{u} by providing natural language feedback \mathbf{fb}. This is feasible even if the user does not know the correctness of \mathbf{y} because they are critiquing the model’s understanding of their intent rather the answers themselves.  As mentioned, given an input \mathbf{x}, we prompt the model to generate an output \mathbf{y} and a sentence \mathbf{u} expressing its understanding of the task.Thus, the in-context examples for \oursare of the form \mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y}.In addition to the input \mathbf{x}, \oursretrieves a \mathbf{fb} if a question similar to \mathbf{x} has been asked before.To enable the model to react to such feedback, we also include examples of the form (\mathbf{x},\mathbf{fb}\rightarrow\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y}) in the prompt, which are aimed to teach the model to react to \mathbf{fb} (Appendix D). Our approach, \ours, pairs gpt-3 with a growing memory of cases where the model misunderstood user’s intent and was provided with corrective feedback.This feedback is question dependent, and thus the prompt for each sample is edited to adapt to the input.In this sense, our work can be seen as an instance of prompt engineering Liu et al.

Further, it is desirable to have a system that can leverage past feedback on new, unseen examples for prompt-editing. We maintain a memory \mathcal{M} of such feedback as a set of key-value pairs, where thekey is a misunderstood question, and the value is the user’s feedback to correct that misunderstanding. Given a new question, we check if the model has made a mistakeon a similar question earlier, by querying the memory for a similar question. If found,append the corresponding feedback to the question prompt. This mechanism aims toprevent the model from making the same type of mistake twice.

1012,Is this work focused only on solving cases where GPT-3 misunderstands the users' intents?,"Finally, our work is a simple example of debugging and learning via dialog. While system debugging through dialogue has been explored in many contexts (Hixon et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Davis, 1977), our contribution is a dialogue about the model’s understanding of the user’s intent. Our approach, \ours, pairs gpt-3 with a growing memory of cases where the model misunderstood user’s intent and was provided with corrective feedback.This feedback is question dependent, and thus the prompt for each sample is edited to adapt to the input.In this sense, our work can be seen as an instance of prompt engineering Liu et al. (2021b) which involves editing the prompts. Our work adds interactivity to prompt engineering as it involves dynamically updating the prompt for every instance. Figure 1 presents a sample interaction between a user and gpt-3 that our setup enables.The model was asked for a similar word. However, the model’s (incorrect) task understanding \mathbf{u} was “The homophone of good is”.The user can detect such discrepancy between the intended and interpreted task instruction, and can provide feedback \mathbf{fb} as ""similar to means with a similar meaning"", clarifying that they actually wanted a synonym.Crucially, note that such instructional correction is feasible even if the user does not knowthe correct answer to their question, as they are critiquing the model’s understanding of theirintent, rather than the answers themselves.Thus, our setup does not require the users to be experts at tasks being solved, another advantage of our approach. This paper sets out the general architecture and a simple implementation of its components.We then demonstrate the system on four tasks, using simulated user feedback:(1) lexical relations (e.g., antonyms, Figure 1),(2) word scrambling (e.g., anagrams), (3) ethics (with user feedback being the appropriate class of ethicalconsideration, e.g., “it is about cheating”, using a small set of categories), and (4) ethics (with user feedback beingnatural language). We find that in all cases, gpt-3’s accuracy significantly increases with time, without retraining,as our approach enables it to use corrective feedback from earlier examples to avoid similar misunderstandings on future examples. In summary, our contributions are:\bulletWe show that a large model like gpt-3 can be improved after deployment, without retraining, through a memory-assisted architecture.\bulletOur implementation, \ours, is the first demonstration that this is possible - this is an important step forward for real use of LMs, and the paper sets out a general architecture that others can build on, a specific implementation, and detailed evaluation on multiple tasks. We demonstrate an application of \oursfor personalization with a use-case where user language preferences can be folded in the memory. We simulate a user who does not speak fluent English and uses code-mixed language. The queries posed by the user contain words from two Indian languages: Hindi and Punjabi. gpt-3 predictably misunderstands the task. The user clarifies the meanings of their dialect/language phrases. While initial queries fail, subsequent queries that reuse similar words succeed because their clarifications are present in the memory (details in Appendix §G). We present \ours, a novel, memory-enhanced gpt-3 that allows users to interact and improve the model without retraining. A key insight is to have the model articulate not just its answer but also its understanding of the user’s intent, providing an avenue for feedback.We show that deployed systems with fixed large-language models can still be improved by interacting with end-users, potentially improving their performance and broadening their utility. In Tandon et al. (2022), we show that using a memory of user feedback can be used to repair erroneous model in a supervised setting.In this work, we build upon the recent advances in few-shot prompting to modify gpt-3’s behavior by adding user feedback to the query (prompt).Like others, we use gpt-3 with few-shot prompting, where the prompt consistsof a prefix prefix containing a few input-output “training” examples of the task, followed by the input x, e.g., a question,to operate on.

1020,What weaknesses would a dataset that without entity replacement or anonymization have when training a reading comprehension model? Why is this a necessary step in the process?,"To prevent such degenerate solutions and create a focused task we anonymise andrandomise our corpora with the following procedure,a) use a coreference system to establish coreferents in eachdata point;b) replace all entities with abstract entity markers according tocoreference;c) randomly permute these entity markers whenever a data point is loaded. Compare the original and anonymised version of the example in Table3. Clearly a human reader can answer both queries correctly.However in the anonymised setup the context document is required for answeringthe query, whereas the original version could also be answered by someone withthe requisite background knowledge.Therefore, following this procedure, the only remaining strategy for answeringquestions is to do so by exploiting the context presented with each question.Thus performance on our two corpora truly measures reading comprehensioncapability. Naturally a production system would benefit from using allavailable information sources, such as clues through language and co-occurrencestatistics.","Since the authors are attempting to build a reading comprehension model, not anonymizing the entities before using the dataset might lead to a situation where models use external information, or statistics on the distribution/frequency of words themselves to guess answers.

1021,"What is the main difference between the ""maximum frequency"" and ""exclusive frequency"" baselines? ","So far we have motivated the need for better datasets and tasks to evaluate thecapabilities of machine reading models. We proceed by describing a number ofbaselines, benchmarks and new models to evaluate against this paradigm. Wedefine two simple baselines, the majority baseline (maximum frequency)picks the entity most frequently observed in the context document, whereas theexclusive majority (exclusive frequency) chooses the entity mostfrequently observed in the context but not observed in the query. The ideabehind this exclusion is that the placeholder is unlikely to be mentioned twicein a single Cloze form query.","The main difference between the “maximum frequency” and “exclusive frequency” baselines is that the latter eliminates all entities found in the query as potential answers.

1022,All the models proposed in this paper are sequence-to-sequence models. True or False?,"Long short-term memory (LSTM, [18]) networks haverecently seen considerable success in tasks such as machine translation andlanguage modelling [17]. When used for translation, DeepLSTMs [19] have shown a remarkable ability to embed longsequences into a vector representation which contains enough information togenerate a full translation in another language. Our first neural model forreading comprehension tests the ability of Deep LSTM encoders to handlesignificantly longer sequences. We feed our documents one word at a time intoa Deep LSTM encoder, after a delimiter we then also feed the query into theencoder. Alternatively we also experiment with processing the query then thedocument. The result is that this model processes each document query pair as asingle long sequence. Given the embedded document and query the networkpredicts which token in the document answers the query. Within the group of neural models explored here, the results paint a clearpicture with the Impatient and the Attentive Readers outperforming all othermodels. This is consistent with our hypothesis that attention is a keyingredient for machine reading and question answering due to the need topropagate information over long distances. The Deep LSTM Readerperforms surprisingly well, once again demonstrating that this simple sequentialarchitecture can do a reasonable job of learning to abstract long sequences,even when they are up to two thousand tokens in length. However this model doesfail to match the performance of the attention based models, even though theseonly use single layer LSTMs.666Memory constraints prevented us fromexperimenting with deeper Attentive Readers.","The authors seem to be using LSTM models for performing their analysis and experiments.

1023,What is the main mathematical difference between the attentive LSTM reader and the vanilla Deep LSTM?,"The Attentive Reader can be viewed as a generalisation of the application ofMemory Networks to question answering [3]. That model employsan attention mechanism at the sentence level where each sentence is representedby a bag of embeddings. The Attentive Reader employs a finer grained tokenlevel attention mechanism where the tokens are embedded given their entirefuture and past context in the input document. We can visualise the attention mechanism as a heatmap over a context document togain further insight into the models’ performance. The highlighted words showwhich tokens in the document were attended to by the model. In addition we mustalso take into account that the vectors at each token integrate long rangecontextual information via the bidirectional LSTM encoders.Figure 3 depicts heat maps for two queries that were correctlyanswered by the Attentive Reader.777Note that these examples were chosenas they were short, the average CNN validation document contained 763 tokens and27 entities, thus most instances were significantly harder to answer than theseexamples. In both cases confidently arriving at the correct answer requires themodel to perform both significant lexical generalsiation, e.g. ‘killed’\rightarrow ‘deceased’, and co-reference or anaphora resolution, e.g. ‘ent119 was killed’ \rightarrow ‘he was identified.’ However it is alsoclear that the model is able to integrate these signals with rough heuristicindicators such as the proximity of query words to the candidate answer.",The main difference between the attention-based LSTM and the vanilla one is that the former addresses the limitation of vanilla LSTM’s fixed and limited context size by taking into account the entire context of every token via a token-level attention mechanism.,The cost function of the depthwise convolution is D_{K}\cdot D_{K}\cdot\alpha M\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F},0.1739130394234405,0.0,0.1304347785538753,1.2350387043213578,15.553243521185706,14.23287866458296,0.0471698113207547,0.003409388932599,0.0487808845937252,0.1716857938424286,0.0487808622419834,0.3093041777610779,0.0108056604608773,0.0,0.7661768989376826,0.6957819720170593

1028,Do the authors claim that bigger datasets would improve the performance and expressiveness of reading comprehension models?,"While obtaining supervised natural language reading comprehension data hasproved difficult, some researchers have explored generating synthetic narrativesand queries [3, 4]. Such approaches allowthe generation of almost unlimited amounts of supervised data and enableresearchers to isolate the performance of their algorithms on individualsimulated phenomena. Work on such data has shown that neural network basedmodels hold promise for modelling reading comprehension, something that wewill build upon here. Historically, however, many similar approaches inComputational Linguistics have failed to manage the transition from syntheticdata to real environments, as such closed worlds inevitably fail tocapture the complexity, richness, and noise of natural language[5]. The supervised paradigm for training machine reading and comprehension modelsprovides a promising avenue for making progress on the path to building fullnatural language understanding systems. We have demonstrated a methodology forobtaining a large number of document-query-answer triples and shown thatrecurrent and attention based neural networks provide an effective modellingframework for this task.Our analysis indicates that the Attentive and Impatient Readers are able topropagate and integrate semantic information over long distances.

1032,Could the authors have used a BiLSTM instead of an LSTM to improve the performance of their proposed model further?,"It is natural to model p(S_{t}|I,S_{0},\ldots,S_{t-1}) with aRecurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the variable number ofwords we condition upon up to t-1 is expressed by a fixed lengthhidden state or memory h_{t}. This memory is updated after seeing anew input x_{t} by using a non-linear function f:h_{t+1}=f(h_{t},x_{t})\;.(3)To make the above RNN more concrete two crucial design choices are to be made: what isthe exact form of f and how are the images and words fed as inputs x_{t}. Forf we use a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) net, which has shown state-of-the artperformance on sequence tasks such as translation. This model is outlined in thenext section. The LSTM model is trained to predict each word of thesentence after it has seen the image as well as all preceding words as defined byp(S_{t}|I,S_{0},\ldots,S_{t-1}). For this purpose, it is instructive to thinkof the LSTM in unrolled form – a copy of the LSTM memory is created for theimage and each sentence word such that all LSTMs share the same parameters and theoutput m_{t-1} of the LSTM at time t-1 is fed to the LSTM at time t (seeFigure 3). All recurrent connections are transformed to feed-forward connections in theunrolled version. In more detail, if we denote by I the inputimage and by S=(S_{0},\ldots,S_{N}) a true sentence describing this image, theunrolling procedure reads:\displaystyle x_{-1}\displaystyle=\displaystyle\textrm{CNN}(I)(10)\displaystyle x_{t}\displaystyle=\displaystyle W_{e}S_{t},\quad t\in\{0\ldots N-1\}\quad(11)\displaystyle p_{t+1}\displaystyle=\displaystyle\textrm{LSTM}(x_{t}),\quad t\in\{0\ldots N-1\}\quad(12)where we represent each word as a one-hot vector S_{t} of dimension equal to thesize of the dictionary. Note that we denote by S_{0} a special start word and byS_{N} a special stop word which designates the start and end of the sentence.In particular by emitting the stop word the LSTM signals that a complete sentencehas been generated. Both the image and the words are mapped to the same space,the image by using a vision CNN, the words by using word embedding W_{e}. The imageI is only input once, at t=-1, to inform the LSTM about the image contents. Weempirically verified that feeding the image at each time step as an extra input yieldsinferior results, as the network can explicitly exploit noise in the image andoverfits more easily.","While the paper shows that LSTM has shown good performance on some sequence tasks, since there is no evidential information about BiLSTM in this paper this question cannot be answered in this paper.

1037,"Can the architecture the authors' proposed be replaced with newer model architectures such as attention-based models or transformers, or is their task incompatible with these newer architectures?","In this work we combine deepconvolutional nets for image classification [12] withrecurrent networks for sequence modeling[10], to create a single networkthat generates descriptions of images. The RNN is trained in the context ofthis single “end-to-end” network.

The closest works are by Kiros et al. [15] whouse a neural net, but a feedforward one, to predict the next word given the imageand previous words. A recent work by Mao et al. [21] uses a recurrentNN for the same prediction task. This is very similar to the present proposal butthere are a number of important differences: we use a more powerful RNN model,and provide the visual input to the RNN model directly, which makes it possiblefor the RNN to keep track of the objects that have been explained by the text. Asa result of these seemingly insignificant differences, our system achievessubstantially better results on the established benchmarks. Lastly, Kiros et al. [14]propose to construct a joint multimodal embedding space by using a powerfulcomputer vision model and an LSTM that encodes text.

1042,"Why do the authors use heuristics to estimate a variable's life span in the computational graph, instead of calculating it exactly?","Memory Allocation.Note that each variable’s life time, namely the period between thecreation and the last time will be used, is known for a computation graph.So we can reuse memory for non-intersected variables.However, an ideal allocation strategy requires O(n^{2}) timecomplexity, where n is the number of variables. We proposed two heuristics strategies with linear time complexity.The first, called inplace, simulates the procedure of traversingthe graph, and keeps a reference counter of depended nodes that are not used sofar. If the counter reaches zero, the memory is recycled.The second, named co-share, allows two nodes to share a piece of memory if only ifthey cannot be run in parallel. Exploring co-share imposes one additionaldependency constraint.In particular, each time upon scheduling, among the pending paths in the graph, we find the longest path and perform needed memory allocations. Figure 7 shows the memory usages of the internal variables excepts for the outputs.As can be seen, both “inplace” and “co-share” can effective reduce the memoryfootprint. Combing them leads to a 2x reduction for all networks during modeltraining, and further improves to 4x for model prediction. For instance,even for the most expensive VGG net, training needs less than 16MB extra.","While calculating the variable's estimated life span costs quadratic time complexity, heuristics costs only linear time complexity which is much efficient.

While the vocabulary size is a contributing factor, the action space is larger because of the inherent structure of language.

In language modeling, the action space includes not only the vocabulary size but also the order and sequence of tokens. This means that the number of possible actions is exponentially larger than the vocabulary size, making it challenging to learn and optimize policies.

In contrast, the action space in the real world, such as degrees of movement, is discrete and finite, making it easier to learn and optimize policies.

1061,How is Nesterov-style momentum different from other momentum based optimizers such as Adam/AdamW?,"In the case of the TIMIT dataset, two additional (boolean) hyperparameters were considered (not tuned for the other two datasets).The first one was the choice between traditional momentum and Nesterov-style momentum [42]. Our analysis showed that this had no measurable effect on performance so the latter was arbitrarily chosen for all further experiments.The second one was whether to clip the gradients to the range [-1,1].

1062,The results section concludes that momentum affected neither the training compute cost nor the performance - why was this a surprising or unexpected result?,"One unexpected result of this study is that momentum affects neither performance nor training time in any significant way.This follows from the observation that for none of the datasets, momentum accounted for more than 1% of the variance of test set performance.It should be noted that for TIMIT the interaction between learning rate and momentum accounts for 2.5% of the total variance, but as with learning rate \times hidden size (cf. Interaction of Hyperparameters below) it does not reveal any interpretable structure.This may be the result of our choice to scale learning rates dependent on momentum (Section IV-B).These observations suggest that momentum does not offer substantial benefits when training LSTMs with online stochastic gradient descent. As expected, the learning rate is the most crucial hyperparameter, followed by the network size.Surprisingly though, the use of momentum was found to be unimportant in our setting of online gradient descent.Gaussian noise on the inputs was found to be moderately helpful for TIMIT, but harmful for the other datasets.",It is not clear why was the result an unexpected result since there is no evidential information of what the authors expected when choosing the hyperparameters to assess their importance.,"No. RPN is not used as a secondary classifier for proposing boundary boxes in the Faster R-CNN (F-RCNN) framework.

1063,How did the authors ensure that fair comparison between the 9 variants of LSTMs they analysed?,"For fair comparison, the setup needs to be similar for each variant.Different variants might require different settings of hyperparameters to give good performance, and we are interested in the best performance that can be achieved with each variant.For this reason we chose to tune the hyperparameters like learning rate or amount of input noise individually for each variant.Since hyperparameter space is large and impossible to traverse completely, random search was used in order to obtain good-performing hyperparameters [18] for every combination of variant and dataset.Random search was also chosen for the added benefit of providing enough data for analyzing the general effect of various hyperparameters on the performance of each LSTM variant (Section V-B).","To ensure the fair comparison that needs to be similar for each variant, the authors tuned the hyperparameters individually for each variant, and use random search to 1) obtain good hyperparameters and 2) collect enough amount of samples for analyzing the general effect of each variant.","Sure!

1064,What are the eight different LSTM variants that the authors experimented with?,"The focus of our study is to empirically compare different LSTM variants, and not to achieve state-of-the-art results.Therefore, our experiments are designed to keep the setup simple and the comparisons fair.The vanilla LSTM is used as a baseline and evaluated together with eight of its variants.Each variant adds, removes, or modifies the baseline in exactly one aspect, which allows to isolate their effect.They are evaluated on three different datasets from different domains to account for cross-domain variations. This paper reports the results of a large scale study on variants of the LSTM architecture. We conclude that the most commonly used LSTM architecture (vanilla LSTM) performs reasonably well on various datasets.None of the eight investigated modifications significantly improves performance.However, certain modifications such as coupling the input and forget gates (CIFG) or removing peephole connections (NP) simplified LSTMs in our experiments without significantly decreasing performance.These two variants are also attractive because they reduce the number of parameters and the computational cost of the LSTM. The first important observation based on Figure 3 is that removing the output activation function (NOAF) or the forget gate (NFG) significantly hurt performance on all three datasets. Apart from the CEC, the ability to forget old information and the squashing of the cell state appear to be critical for the LSTM architecture. Indeed, without the output activation function, the block output can in principle grow unbounded. Coupling the input and the forget gate avoids this problem and might render the use of an output non-linearity less important, which could explain why GRU performs well without it. Adding full gate recurrence (FGR) did not significantly change performance on TIMIT or IAM Online, but led to worse results on the JSB Chorales dataset. Given that this variant greatly increases the number of parameters, we generally advise against using it. Note that this feature was present in the original proposal of LSTM [14, 15], but has been absent in all following studies. Removing the input gate (NIG), the output gate (NOG), and the input activation function (NIAF) led to a significant reduction in performance on speech and handwriting recognition. However, there was no significant effect on music modeling performance. A small (but statistically insignificant) average performance improvement was observed for the NIG and NIAF architectures on music modeling. We hypothesize that these behaviors will generalize to similar problems such as language modeling. For supervised learning on continuous real-valued data (such as speech and handwriting recognition), the input gate, output gate, and input activation function are all crucial for obtaining good performance.","The authors conducted the experiment with these LSTM variants of the vanilla architecture to empirically compare different LSTM variants: No Input Gate (NIG), No Forget Gate (NFG), No Output Gate (NOG), No Input Activation Function (NIAF), No Output Activation Function (NOAF), Coupled Input and Forget Gate (CIFG), No Peepholes (NP), Full Gate Recurrence (FGR).","The authors did not use previous studies as baseline models because they wanted to focus on flexible musical expressions and personal interpretation, rather than following a composer's intent or imitating existing performances",0.1159420240117624,0.0249999952531259,0.1159420240117624,1.147396448993958,23.57528083894351,19.625536815354653,0.0402684563758389,0.0062353858144972,0.2016789317131042,0.3872860375020944,0.2016788870096206,0.2222409695386886,0.0050645159588038,,0.7861064377721686,0.7574521365940443
1065,Do the authors use different ratios of test-train-validation split for each dataset? ,"The performance is measured as classification error percentage. The training, testing, and validation sets are split in line with Halberstadt [37] into 3696, 400, and 192 sequences, having 304 frames on average. The TIMIT Speech corpus [26] is large enough to be a reasonable acoustic modeling benchmark for speech recognition, yet it is small enough to keep a large study such as ours manageable. Our experiments focus on the frame-wise classification task for this dataset, where the objective is to classify each audio-frame as one of 61 phones.2 From the raw audio we extract 12 Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCCs) [35] + energy over 25ms hamming-windows with stride of 10ms and a pre-emphasis coefficient of 0.97. This preprocessing is standard in speech recognition and was chosen in order to stay comparable with earlier LSTM-based results (e.g. [20, 36]). The 13 coefficients along with their first and second derivatives comprise the 39 inputs to the network and were normalized to have zero mean and unit variance. The IAM Online Handwriting Database [38] consists of English sentences as time series of pen movements that have to be mapped to characters. The IAM-OnDB dataset splits into one training set, two validation sets, and one test set, having 775, 192, 216, and 544 boards each. Each board, see Figure 2(a), contains multiple hand-written lines, which in turn consist of several strokes. We use one line per sequence, and joined the two validation sets together, so the final training, validation, and testing sets contain 5355, 2956 and 3859 sequences respectively.

1070,"What does ""temperature"" mean in context of the authors' proposed model?","In the simplest form of distillation, knowledge is transferred to the distilled model by training it on a transfer setand using a soft target distribution for each case in the transfer set that is produced by using the cumbersome modelwith a high temperature in its softmax. The same high temperature is used when training the distilled model, but afterit has been trained it uses a temperature of 1. Neural networks typically produce class probabilities by using a “softmax” output layer that converts the logit, zi , computed for each class into a probability, qi , by comparing zi with the other logits. qi = exp(zi/T ) P j exp(zj/T ) (1) 2 where T is a temperature that is normally set to 1.

Waiting for several years to train an ensemble of models wasnot an option, so we needed a much faster way to improve the baselinemodel. In order to derive groupings of object categories for the specialists, we decided to focus on categories that our fullnetwork often confuses. Even though we could have computed the confusion matrix and used it as a way to find suchclusters, we opted for a simpler approach that does not require the true labels to construct the clusters. In particular, we apply a clustering algorithm to the covariance matrix of the predictions of our generalist model, so thata set of classes S^{m} that are often predicted together will be used as targets for one of our specialist models, m. We applied an on-lineversion of the K-means algorithm to the columns of the covariance matrix, and obtained reasonable clusters (shown inTable 2). We tried several clustering algorithms which produced similar results. To reduce overfitting and share the work of learning lower level feature detectors, each specialist model is initialized with the weights of the generalist model. These weights are then slightly modified by training the specialist with half its examples coming from its special subset and half sampled at random from the remainder of the training set. After training, we can correct for the biased training set by incrementing the logit of the dustbin class by the log of the proportion by which the specialist class is oversampled.","The K-means algorithm clusters the set of classes that the models often predict together.

If we allow specialists to have a full softmax over allclasses, there may be a much better way to prevent them overfitting than usingearly stopping. A specialist is trained on data that is highlyenriched in its special classes. This means that the effective sizeof its training set is much smaller and it has a strong tendency tooverfit on its special classes.

In this paper, we refer to the term {D}_{src}(x) as a probability distribution over sources given by D. The generator G tries to minimize this objective, while the discriminator D tries to maximize it. Generative Adversarial Networks. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) [3] have shown remarkable results in various computer vision tasks such as image generation [6, 24, 32, 8], image translation [7, 9, 33], super-resolution imaging [14], and face image synthesis [10, 16, 26, 31].

1099,They perform only a qualitative analysis of the proposed model. Is it true?,"Qualitative evaluation. Fig. 4 shows the facial attribute transfer results on CelebA. We observed that our method provides a higher visual quality of translation results on test data compared to the cross-domain models. One possible reason is the regularization effect of StarGAN through a multi-task learning framework. In other words, rather than training a model to perform a fixed translation (e.g., brown-to-blond hair), which is prone to overfitting, we train our model to flexibly translate images according to the labels of the target domain. This allows our model to learn reliable features universally applicable to multiple domains of images with different facial attribute values. Quantitative evaluation protocol. For quantitative evaluations, we performed two user studies in a survey format using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess single and multiple attribute transfer tasks. Given an input image, the Turkers were instructed to choose the best generated image based on perceptual realism, quality of transfer in attribute(s), and preservation of a figure’s original identity. The options were four randomly shuffled images generated from four different methods. The generated images in one study have a single attribute transfer in either hair color (black, blond, brown), gender, or age. In another study, the generated images involve a combination of attribute transfers. Each Turker was asked 30 to 40 questions with a few simple yet logical questions for validating human effort. The number of validated Turkers in each user study is 146 and 100 in single and multiple transfer tasks, respectively. Quantitative results. Tables 1 and 2 show the results of our AMT experiment on single- and multi-attribute transfer tasks, respectively. StarGAN obtained the majority of votes for best transferring attributes in all cases.In the case of gender changes in Table 1, the voting difference between our model and other models was marginal, e.g., 39.1% for StarGAN vs. 31.4% for DIAT. However, in multi-attribute changes, e.g., the ‘G+A’ case in Table 2, the performance difference becomes significant, e.g., 49.8% for StarGAN vs. 20.3% for IcGAN), clearly showing the advantages of StarGAN in more complicated, multi-attribute transfer tasks. This is because unlike the other methods, StarGAN can handle image translation involving multiple attribute changes by randomly generating a target domain label in the training phase. Qualitative evaluation. As seen in Fig. 5, StarGAN clearly generates the most natural-looking expressions while properly maintaining the personal identity and facial features of the input. While DIAT and CycleGAN mostly preserve the identity of the input, many of their results are shown blurry and do not maintain the degree of sharpness as seen in the input. IcGAN even fails to preserve the personal identity in the image by generating male images. Quantitative evaluation. For a quantitative evaluation, we compute the classification error of a facial expression on synthesized images. We trained a facial expression classifier on the RaFD dataset (90%/10% splitting for training and test sets) using a ResNet-18 architecture [5], resulting in a near-perfect accuracy of 99.55%. We then trained each of image translation models using the same training set and performed image translation on the same, unseen test set. Finally, we classified the expression of these translated images using the above-mentioned classifier. As can be seen in Table 3, our model achieves the lowest classification error, indicating that our model produces the most realistic facial expressions among all the methods compared.",False.

Meanwhile, they are ineffective that even though there exist global features that can be learned from images of all domains such as face shapes, each generator cannot fully utilize the entire training data and only can learn from two domains out of k. Failure to fully utilize training data is likely to limit the quality of generated images.

1103,What is an example attribute used in experiment of joint training?,"Several image datasets come with a number of labeled attributes. For instance, the CelebA[19] dataset contains 40 labels related to facial attributes such as hair color, gender, and age, and the RaFD [13] dataset has 8 labels for facial expressions such as ‘happy’, ‘angry’ and ‘sad’. These settings enable us to perform more interesting tasks, namely multi-domain image-to-image translation, where we change images according to attributes from multiple domains. The first five columns in Fig. StarGAN: Unified Generative Adversarial Networks  for Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation show how a CelebA image can be translated according to any of the four domains, ‘blond hair’, ‘gender’, ‘aged’, and ‘pale skin’. We can further extend to training multiple domains from different datasets, such as jointly training CelebA and RaFD images to change a CelebA image’s facial expression using features learned by training on RaFD, as in the rightmost columns of Fig. StarGAN: Unified Generative Adversarial Networks  for Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation.

StarGAN-JNT exhibits emotional expressions with high visual quality, while StarGAN-SNG generates reasonable but blurry images with gray backgrounds. This difference is due to the fact that StarGAN-JNT learns to translate CelebA images during training but not StarGAN-SNG. In other words, StarGAN-JNT can leverage both datasets to improve shared low-level tasks such facial keypoint detection and segmentation. By utilizing both CelebA and RaFD, StarGAN-JNT can improve these low-level tasks, which is beneficial to learning facial expression synthesis.",We can't know from given paragraphs.,"KG-Classifier works as a query in the attention-like mechanism, using the hidden representation h^{l}_{KGC} of the KG-Classifier adapter to substitute Q^{l} in the equation",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.125508654753644,3.0941314910652338,0.0,0.0099009900990099,0.0931648388504982,0.3008736660351623,0.0931648090481758,0.2049508541822433,0.0033133374991183,0.0,0.7734577468857119,0.7361051835475869

1105,What problem can occur when you train a generator only with an adversarial loss and a domain classification loss?,"Reconstruction Loss. By minimizing the adversarial and classification losses, G is trained to generate images that are realistic and classified to its correct target domain. However, minimizing the losses (Eqs. (1) and (3)) does not guarantee that translated images preserve the content of its input images while changing only the domain-related part of the inputs. To alleviate this problem, we apply a cycle consistency loss [9, 33] to the generator, defined as\mathcal{L}_{rec}={\mathbb{E}}_{x,c,c^{\prime}}[{||x-G(G(x,c),c^{\prime})||}_{1}],(4)where G takes in the translated image G(x,c) and the original domain label c^{\prime} as input and tries to reconstruct the original image x. We adopt the L1 norm as our reconstruction loss. Note that we use a single generator twice, first to translate an original image into an image in the target domain and then to reconstruct the original image from the translated image.","When loss function does not contains reconstruction loss, minimizing the losses does not guarantee that translated images preserve the content of its input images while changing only the domain-related part of the inputs.","Sure!

1106,"Why do they divide domain classification loss in two terms for real image and fake image, respectively?","Domain Classification Loss. For a given input image x and a target domain label c, our goal is to translate x into an output image y, which is properly classified to the target domain c. To achieve this condition, we add an auxiliary classifier on top of D and impose the domain classification loss when optimizing both D and G. That is, we decompose the objective into two terms: a domain classification loss of real images used to optimize D, and a domain classification loss of fake images used to optimize G. In detail, the former is defined as\mathcal{L}_{cls}^{r}={\mathbb{E}}_{x,c^{\prime}}[-\log{{D}_{cls}(c^{\prime}|x)}],(2)where the term {D}_{cls}(c^{\prime}|x) represents a probability distribution over domain labels computed by D. By minimizing this objective, D learns to classify a real image x to its corresponding original domain c^{\prime}. We assume that the input image and domain label pair (x,c^{\prime}) is given by the training data. On the other hand, the loss function for the domain classification of fake images is defined as\mathcal{L}_{cls}^{f}={\mathbb{E}}_{x,c}[-\log{{D}_{cls}(c|G(x,c))}].(3)In other words, G tries to minimize this objective to generate images that can be classified as the target domain c.

1107,How do they make StarGAN to ignore unspecified labels?,"Mask Vector. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a mask vector m that allows StarGAN to ignore unspecified labels and focus on the explicitly known label provided by a particular dataset. In StarGAN, we use an n-dimensional one-hot vector to represent m, with n being the number of datasets. In addition, we define a unified version of the label as a vector\tilde{c}=[{c}_{1},...,{c}_{n},m],(7)where [\cdot] refers to concatenation, and {c}_{i} represents a vector for the labels of the i-th dataset. The vector of the known label {c}_{i} can be represented as either a binary vector for binary attributes or a one-hot vector for categorical attributes. For the remaining n\mathbb{-}1 unknown labels we simply assign zero values. In our experiments, we utilize the CelebA and RaFD datasets, where n is two. Training Strategy. When training StarGAN with multiple datasets, we use the domain label \tilde{c} defined in Eq. (7) as input to the generator. By doing so, the generator learns to ignore the unspecified labels, which are zero vectors, and focus on the explicitly given label. The structure of the generator is exactly the same as in training with a single dataset, except for the dimension of the input label \tilde{c}. On the other hand, we extend the auxiliary classifier of the discriminator to generate probability distributions over labels for all datasets. Then, we train the model in a multi-task learning setting, where the discriminator tries to minimize only the classification error associated to the known label. For example, when training with images in CelebA, the discriminator minimizes only classification errors for labels related to CelebA attributes, and not facial expressions related to RaFD. Under these settings, by alternating between CelebA and RaFD the discriminator learns all of the discriminative features for both datasets, and the generator learns to control all the labels in both datasets.","By using mask vector, StarGAN was allowed to ignore unspecified labels.",The authors chose a greedy approach for the general classifier because it is computationally efficient and yields small perturbations that are believed to be good approximations of the minimal perturbation,0.0499999960125003,0.0,0.0499999960125003,0.8354147375169957,9.510976984872686,7.604876042455122,0.0340136054421768,0.0102389078498293,0.1431858092546463,0.3279138433897023,0.1431858390569687,0.4301201105117798,0.0122984264161408,0.0,0.7596170686487521,0.7624766788824235

For the remaining n\mathbb{-}1 unknown labels we simply assign zero values. In our experiments, we utilize the CelebA and RaFD datasets, where n is two. Learned role of mask vector. In this experiment, we gave a one-hot vector c by setting the dimension of a particular facial expression (available from the second dataset, RaFD) to one. In this case, since the label associated with the second data set is explicitly given, the proper mask vector would be [0,1]. Fig. 7 shows the case where this proper mask vector was given and the opposite case where a wrong mask vector of [1,0] was given.When the wrong mask vector was used, StarGAN-JNT fails to synthesize facial expressions, and it manipulates the age of the input image. This is because the model ignores the facial expression label as unknown and treats the facial attribute label as valid by the mask vector. Note that since one of the facial attributes is ‘young’, the model translates the image from young to old when it takes in a zero vector as input. From this behavior, we can confirm that StarGAN properly learned the intended role of a mask vector in image-to-image translations when involving all the labels from multiple datasets altogether. In this paper, we proposed StarGAN, a scalable image-to-image translation model among multiple domains using a single generator and a discriminator. Besides the advantages in scalability, StarGAN generated images of higher visual quality compared to existing methods [16, 23, 33], owing to the generalization capability behind the multi-task learning setting. In addition, the use of the proposed simple mask vector enables StarGAN to utilize multiple datasets with different sets of domain labels, thus handling all available labels from them. We hope our work to enable users to develop interesting image translation applications across multiple domains.  We also introduce a simple but effective approach that enables joint training between domains of different datasets by adding a mask vector to the domain label. Our proposed method ensures that the model can ignore unknown labels and focus on the label provided by a particular dataset. In this manner, our model can perform well on tasks such as synthesizing facial expressions of CelebA images using features learned from RaFD, as shown in the rightmost columns of Fig. StarGAN: Unified Generative Adversarial Networks  for Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation. As far as our knowledge goes, our work is the first to successfully perform multi-domain image translation across different datasets. Overall, our contributions are as follows:\bulletWe propose StarGAN, a novel generative adversarial network that learns the mappings among multiple domains using only a single generator and a discriminator, training effectively from images of all domains.\bulletWe demonstrate how we can successfully learn multi-domain image translation between multiple datasets by utilizing a mask vector method that enables StarGAN to control all available domain labels.\bulletWe provide both qualitative and quantitative results on facial attribute transfer and facial expression synthesis tasks using StarGAN, showing its superiority over baseline models.","In order to ignore unspecified vectors and link different domains, mask vectors are necessray.","The authors computed the contributions of the pixels using the absolute value of the elementwise product of the gradient and the input, and then used a threshold-based approach to clip pixels with smaller contributions",0.1081081035500367,0.0,0.0540540494959828,0.981612240918818,10.678925337767335,9.211309534609228,0.0837988826815642,0.0101979604079184,0.2079062163829803,0.3790050806336453,0.2079063057899475,0.5181565284729004,0.0077547747730988,0.0,0.7901667569802453,0.7507819099925935

Is it true?,"Another important advantage of our model is the scalability in terms of the number of parameters required. The last column in Table 3 shows that the number of parameters required to learn all translations by StarGAN is seven times smaller than that of DIAT and fourteen times smaller than that of CycleGAN.

1110,How many benchmark dataset are used to evaluate the proposed model?,"We utilize three standard citation network benchmark datasets—Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed (Sen et al., 2008)—and closely follow the transductive experimental setup of Yang et al.

We allow for only 20 nodes per class to be used for training—however, honoring the transductive setup, the training algorithm has access to all of the nodes’ feature vectors. The predictive power of the trained models is evaluated on 1000 test nodes, and we use 500 additional nodes for validation purposes (the same ones as used by Kipf & Welling (2017)).

1113,What point is different in GATs in terms of assigning weight compared to GCN?,"The graph attentional layer described in subsection 2.1 directly addresses several issues that were present in prior approaches to modelling graph-structured data with neural networks:•Computationally, it is highly efficient: the operation of the self-attentional layer can be parallelized across all edges, and the computation of output features can be parallelized across all nodes. No eigendecompositions or similar costly matrix operations are required. The time complexity of a single GAT attention head computing F^{\prime} features may be expressed as O(|V|FF^{\prime}+|E|F^{\prime}), where F is the number of input features, and |V| and |E| are the numbers of nodes and edges in the graph, respectively. This complexity is on par with the baseline methods such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2017). Applying multi-head attention multiplies the storage and parameter requirements by a factor of K, while the individual heads’ computations are fully independent and can be parallelized.•As opposed to GCNs, our model allows for (implicitly) assigning different importances to nodes of a same neighborhood, enabling a leap in model capacity. Furthermore, analyzing the learned attentional weights may lead to benefits in interpretability, as was the case in the machine translation domain (e.g. the qualitative analysis of Bahdanau et al. (2015)).•The attention mechanism is applied in a shared manner to all edges in the graph, and therefore it does not depend on upfront access to the global graph structure or (features of) all of its nodes (a limitation of many prior techniques). This has several desirable implications:–The graph is not required to be undirected (we may simply leave out computing \alpha_{ij} if edge j\rightarrow i is not present).–It makes our technique directly applicable to inductive learning—including tasks where the model is evaluated on graphs that are completely unseen during training.•The recently published inductive method of Hamilton et al. (2017) samples a fixed-size neighborhood of each node, in order to keep its computational footprint consistent; this does not allow it access to the entirety of the neighborhood while performing inference. Moreover, this technique achieved some of its strongest results when an LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)-based neighborhood aggregator is used. This assumes the existence of a consistent sequential node ordering across neighborhoods, and the authors have rectified it by consistently feeding randomly-ordered sequences to the LSTM. Our technique does not suffer from either of these issues—it works with the entirety of the neighborhood (at the expense of a variable computational footprint, which is still on-par with methods like the GCN), and does not assume any ordering within it.•As mentioned in Section 1, GAT can be reformulated as a particular instance of MoNet (Monti et al., 2016). More specifically, setting the pseudo-coordinate function to be u(x,y)=f(x)\|f(y), where f(x) represent (potentially MLP-transformed) features of node x and \| is concatenation; and the weight function to be w_{j}(u)=\mathrm{softmax}(\mathrm{MLP}(u)) (with the softmax performed over the entire neighborhood of a node) would make MoNet’s patch operator similar to ours. Nevertheless, one should note that, in comparison to previously considered MoNet instances, our model uses node features for similarity computations, rather than the node’s structural properties (which would assume knowing the graph structure upfront). We were able to produce a version of the GAT layer that leverages sparse matrix operations, reducing the storage complexity to linear in the number of nodes and edges and enabling the execution of GAT models on larger graph datasets. However, the tensor manipulation framework we used only supports sparse matrix multiplication for rank-2 tensors, which limits the batching capabilities of the layer as it is currently implemented (especially for datasets with multiple graphs). Appropriately addressing this constraint is an important direction for future work. Depending on the regularity of the graph structure in place, GPUs may not be able to offer major performance benefits compared to CPUs in these sparse scenarios. It should also be noted that the size of the “receptive field” of our model is upper-bounded by the depth of the network (similarly as for GCN and similar models). Techniques such as skip connections (He et al., 2016) could be readily applied for appropriately extending the depth, however. Lastly, parallelization across all the graph edges, especially in a distributed manner, may involve a lot of redundant computation, as the neighborhoods will often highly overlap in graphs of interest. For the inductive learning task, we apply a three-layer GAT model. Both of the first two layers consist of K=4 attention heads computing F^{\prime}=256 features (for a total of 1024 features), followed by an ELU nonlinearity. The final layer is used for (multi-label) classification: K=6 attention heads computing 121 features each, that are averaged and followed by a logistic sigmoid activation. The training sets for this task are sufficiently large and we found no need to apply L_{2} regularization or dropout—we have, however, successfully employed skip connections (He et al., 2016) across the intermediate attentional layer. We utilize a batch size of 2 graphs during training. To strictly evaluate the benefits of applying an attention mechanism in this setting (i.e. comparing with a near GCN-equivalent model), we also provide the results when a constant attention mechanism, a(x,y)=1, is used, with the same architecture—this will assign the same weight to every neighbor.",GATs uses implicit weight assigning while GCN doesn't.,8.5 MBytes (68 Mbits) of on-chip memory,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.420041655274257,6.31503124145569,0.0,0.0086741016109045,0.0442266054451465,0.1181318599444168,0.0442266874015331,0.1763537675142288,0.0065289607915937,0.5,0.7503822746423646,0.7018464739727176

(2017). Specifically, K independent attention mechanisms execute the transformation of Equation 4, and then their features are concatenated, resulting in the following output feature representation:\vec{h}^{\prime}_{i}=\operatorname*{\scalebox{1.0}[1.5]{$\parallel$}}_{k=1}^{K}\sigma\left(\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}_{i}}\alpha_{ij}^{k}{\bf W}^{k}\vec{h}_{j}\right)(5)where \parallel represents concatenation, \alpha_{ij}^{k} are normalized attention coefficients computed by the k-th attention mechanism (a^{k}), and {\bf W}^{k} is the corresponding input linear transformation’s weight matrix. Note that, in this setting, the final returned output, {\bf h}^{\prime}, will consist of KF^{\prime} features (rather than F^{\prime}) for each node.","to make self-attention stable, they used different mechanism which uses multi-head attention, similar to Vaswani et al.'s one.",To facilitate transfer learning from CNN models trained on ImageNet,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.697966938705164,12.523475204028871,0.0230414746543778,0.0058479532163742,0.0831423625349998,0.2880026668310165,0.098863810300827,0.1787723153829574,0.0007641387690874,,0.8788555035569652,0.7863390908424017

1119,Why was Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) proposed before even if Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) have been successful in many tasks?,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to tackle problems such as image classification (He et al., 2016), semantic segmentation (Jégou et al., 2017) or machine translation (Gehring et al., 2016), where the underlying data representation has a grid-like structure. These architectures efficiently reuse their local filters, with learnable parameters, by applying them to all the input positions. There have been several attempts in the literature to extend neural networks to deal with arbitrarily structured graphs. Early work used recursive neural networks to process data represented in graph domains as directed acyclic graphs (Frasconi et al., 1998; Sperduti & Starita, 1997). Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) were introduced in Gori et al. (2005) and Scarselli et al. (2009) as a generalization of recursive neural networks that can directly deal with a more general class of graphs, e.g. cyclic, directed and undirected graphs. GNNs consist of an iterative process, which propagates the node states until equilibrium; followed by a neural network, which produces an output for each node based on its state. This idea was adopted and improved by Li et al.

1120,What does “patchwise training” mean?,"This method is efficient, both asymptotically and absolutely, and precludes the need for the complications in other works.Patchwise training is common [27, 2, 8, 28, 11], but lacks the efficiency of fully convolutional training.Our approach does not make use of pre- and post-processing complications, including superpixels [8, 16], proposals [16, 14], or post-hoc refinement by random fields or local classifiers [8, 16].Our model transfers recent success in classification [19, 31, 32] to dense prediction by reinterpreting classification nets as fully convolutional and fine-tuning from their learned representations.In contrast, previous works have applied small convnets without supervised pre-training [8, 28, 27]. In stochastic optimization, gradient computation is driven by the training distribution.Both patchwise training and fully-convolutional training can be made to produce any distribution, although their relative computational efficiency depends on overlap and minibatch size.Whole image fully convolutional training is identical to patchwise training where each batch consists of all the receptive fields of the units below the loss for an image (or collection of images).While this is more efficient than uniform sampling of patches, it reduces the number of possible batches.However, random selection of patches within an image may be recovered simply.Restricting the loss to a randomly sampled subset of its spatial terms (or, equivalently applying a DropConnect mask [36] between the output and the loss) excludes patches from the gradient computation.",there is no clue to define what does patchwise train mean.,"Yes.

1129,"What does ""injecting"" information into attention layers mean?","Meanwhile, a parallel line of research has exploredinjecting predefined patterns into attention matrices of transformers in an attemptto reduce the run-time complexity of self-attention while maintaining competitive accuracy.This can be done by either replacing theattention weights with a fixed matrix (Raganato et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2020); or alternatively by guiding the attention weights through more flexible masking strategies (Mihaylov and Frank, 2019; Child et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2021). Once the important patterns are identified, there are two common approaches(i.e. fixing and masking)to injectthem as constraints to the attention matrices in the transformer-based neural models (see §3.2). The pipeline alsoenables two scenarios,in which injectingthe patterns can be beneficial:the first one is to train a new model with the patterns injected, while the second one is to enhance the original model.

Lastly, while it may be argued that this step of the pipeline can be automated by directly evaluating the importance and relevance of predefined patterns (e.g. syntax, discourse) based on intuitions, as indicated below, our interactive approach allows the discovery of interpretable patterns which otherwise would be hard to define due to the infinite search space of possible patterns.

1132,What is the BERTSum model and how does it differ from just the BERT model?,"We adopt the popular BERTSum (Liu and Lapata, 2019) for extractive summarization. With the contextualized representation from BERT, the model uses a binary classifier to predict whether each sentence belongs in the summary. We train the model on the CNN/DM dataset (See et al., 2017), and use ROUGE (Lin, 2004) as the evaluation metric.

Specifically, by injecting human-interpretable patterns into the model, we increase the model’s descriptive accuracy by explicitly encoding useful relationships between input tokens in the attention weights while simultaneously improving the predictive accuracy in task performance. Further, the patterns are relevant for the problem since they are discovered in the human-in-the-loop process and are verified to be important for the task. As shown in Table 1, our pattern-infused models outperform the plain transformer models for both the CNN/DM and NYT-50 datasets under all three settings(6 Layer 8 Heads, 6 Layer 12 Heads, and 6 Layer 12 Heads with BERT embeddings).Similarly for topic segmentation,results also show that the pattern-injection approach substantially outperforms the vanilla transformer across all metrics.It is worthemphasizing that the performance gain is slightly higher for summarization models. When normalized by the ROUGE scores of extractive oracle summaries555As reported by Liu and Lapata (2019), the ROUGE scores (R-1/R-2/R-L) of the oracle upper bound for CNN/DM and NYT-50 are respectively, 52.59/31.24/48.87 and 49.18/33.24/46.02., the pattern-infused summarization models achieve an average 15\% improvement over the baselines, while the topic-segmentation models achieve a 12\% improvement over the baselines.In-line with prior work (McCoy et al., 2020), we also find that the performance is consistent across random seeds, where we report an extremely low standard deviation of0.03 (ROUGE) and 0.002 (F1) for extractive summarization and topic segmentation, respectively. Overall, the results from our experiments convincingly demonstrates the benefits of our approach and the generalizability of the patterns discovered by our pipeline. In summary, the key aim of our experiments was to verify consistent improvements over our own baselines under the same settings in order to probethe benefits (effectiveness and efficiency) of the discovered patterns for the task. Therefore, we do not perform extensive tuning to achieve the same results reported by Liu and Lapata (2019).",Interpretability is measured with the PDR framework.

1136,"Instead of automatically identifying important attention patterns, why should a human be involved in this process?","Once the the most important heads are identified, their attention distributions are inspected to look for patterns. In this work, we propose and test a novel human-in-the-loop pipeline that to the best of our knowledge is the first attemptto combine research on analyzing self-attention with work on injecting patterns into attention matrices.To start, human users visually explore the attention matrices of transformers to identify task-specific patterns that could be formalized as a predicate. After quantitatively evaluating the patterns on the validation set, they can be injected into attention heads of transformer models to simultaneously improve task accuracy and make the model more efficient by sparsifying the attention matrices111The implementation of our work is publicly available at: https://github.com/raymondzmc/Attention-Pattern-Exploitation. This is in contrast to previous work that mostly focuses on the trade-off between two metrics. To discovertask-specific patterns,we analyze the top-3 most important heads of each layer, and look forhuman-interpretable relationships encoded in the attention weights. In practice, we use the instance-level interactions provided by the visual framework (Li et al., 2021), and randomly select 5 validation examples per task for our analysis.The entire process takesless than one hour to complete for each task, where we manually examinethe attention weights for less than half of the tokens for each example.It is worth noting that detailed analysis regarding the trade-off between human costandpattern recallwould require extensive user studies beyond the scope of this work. As future work, we plan to apply our pipeline to other NLP tasks (e.g. language modeling, abstractive summarization) and explore and verify whether the important patterns from one task can be transferable to another task. Similarly, we also plan to apply our pipeline to different model variants to examine and compare the patterns encoded in the attention weights.In the long term, our pipeline could be naturally automated by replacing the pattern discovery step with evaluating predefined linguistic patterns. However, assessing the efficiency gains from injecting such patterns (requiring ground-truth annotations) would require more in-depth studies beyond the scope of this paper.Finally, since human factors are an important aspect of interpretability, we plan to conduct extensive user studies across different NLP tasks and model sizes to examine the trade-off between human-cost and the coverage of discovered patterns.",Human involvement can provide interpretable results from the identified patterns and the performance enhancement from the pattern injection.,"DPR retriever is different from BM25 in that it uses a PLM to empower the retriever with a single vector, while BM25 uses a traditional sparse retriever",0.1111111062500002,0.0,0.1111111062500002,1.499150776705216,20.44290904122222,16.305009895647046,0.050251256281407,0.0102778835173201,0.0975322052836418,0.2369858817463476,0.0975321531295776,0.3300275802612304,0.0051428626627996,,0.7220698784448918,0.7508512132381446
1137,"Why are the patterns only defined between pairs of tokens instead of other possible options (e.g., trios, sequence, sets)?","We define an attention pattern to be interpretable iff it can be modeled as a predicate P between any pair of input tokens (x_{i},x_{j}).For instance, the positional pattern ‘preceding token’ would be true if x_{i} appears before x_{j}. Candidate patterns can be discovered following two criteria:1) they are beneficial for the downstream task;2) they occur consistently among relevant tokens. This pattern describes the “attending to matching tokens” behaviour, wherethe attention value \alpha_{i,j}^{h} between input tokens x_{i} and x_{j} on the head h is high whenever x_{i}=x_{j}. For example, as shown in footnote 3 (i), the token ""photo"" mostly attends to other appearances of the token ""photo"" in the input sequence. To evaluate whether this pattern has a large global relevance for any head, we only consider tokens that appear at least twice within a single documents, and compute GR (Eq. 1), in which P(x_{i},x_{j}) holds if and only if x_{i}=x_{j}, i.e. \mathbbm{1}_{P(x_{i},x_{j})}=(\mathbbm{1}_{\textrm{freq}(x_{i})>1})\times(\mathbbm{1}_{x_{i}=x_{j}}). This pattern describes the behaviour of only attending to tokens within a text span.For summarization, these heads will focus on attending tokens within the same sentence (footnote 3 (ii)). Similarly, the same heads in topic segmentation models will focus on attending tokens within the same context (left or right).To evaluate this pattern, GR is computed with P(x_{i},x_{j}) holding iff x_{i} and x_{j} occur within the same text span. footnote 3 (C) reveals that this pattern appears more frequently in the mid to upper layers of the transformer encoder.",The structural definition of a pattern in this paper follows only naturally from the design of the attention mechanism.,"When the context provides misleading cues.

1138,"Then, overall, is it true that a pattern is determined to have global relevance on an attention head if the pattern has a significantly higher attention value across all samples in a dataset (compared to other heads)?","With a pattern discoveredin §3.1.2, this step confirms the pattern’s global relevance by empirically measuring the proportion of attention values aligning with the pattern. For each attention head, the associated predicate is evaluated over the entire validation set to ensure the pattern is not appearing by chance on the certain data that the user happen to look at. Specifically, we define the global relevance (GR) of a pattern P for a head h as follows:\textrm{GR}(P,h)=\frac{1}{|X|}\sum_{x\in X}\frac{\sum_{i}^{|x|}\sum_{j}^{|x|}\alpha_{i,j}^{(x,h)}\cdot\mathbbm{1}_{P(x_{i},x_{j})}}{|x|}(1)where the attention value from the token x_{i} to x_{j} on the head h for an input sample x, denoted as \alpha_{i,j}^{(x,h)}, is aggregated if and only if P(x_{i},x_{j}) holds. To validate a pattern’s generality, the relevance is averaged over the validation set X. This pattern describes the “attending to matching tokens” behaviour, wherethe attention value \alpha_{i,j}^{h} between input tokens x_{i} and x_{j} on the head h is high whenever x_{i}=x_{j}.

1139,How does using the fixed attention approach affect performance differently when compared to the masked attention approach?,"In this work, we injectthe discovered patternsby either fixing or masking the attention weights prior to the softmax function.For fixed attention weights, the attention logits in the scaled-dot-product attention is replaced with a fixed (possibly input dependent) matrix such that:\textrm{FixAttn}(V,X)=\sigma(F^{(P)}(X))V(2)where \sigma is the softmax operation, V is the value vectors, and F(X)\in[0,1] computes a binary matrix from the input sequence X based on the predicated P for the specific pattern. Similarly, a pattern can also be injectedby casting a mask over the attention weights computed from the key and query vectors, as:\textrm{MaskAttn}(Q,K,V,X)=\sigma(M^{(P)}(X)+QK^{T})V(3)where M(X)\in[0,-\infty) computes the desired behaviour in the same fashion as F(X), and is added to the attention logits to approximate the multiplication of the attention distribution by a weight. Although the two methods are very similar with respect to the improvement they contribute (see §4), masking allows more flexibility and is generally used for patterns with a large number of applicable tokens, while fixing is more rigid and better suited for a small number of applicable tokens.",There is no discussion on how the performance difference is brought about.,"By demonstrating that their method can successfully capture finer details of personalized objects that the image encoder (CLIP) is unlikely to have seen, such as color patterns on a teapot or a skull mug, using only a single word embedding",0.1249999964670139,0.0,0.0833333298003473,0.3745248996340621,9.09716375432396,7.836466658727964,0.093167701863354,0.0104166666666666,-0.0370635874569416,0.3404345188511015,-0.0370636470615863,0.125129833817482,0.0042026713036893,0.3333333333333333,0.7809466571037973,0.7411036154226249
1140,"How did the authors measure ""interpretability""?","In both scenarios, we argue the interpretability of the resulting model is improved. We provide a justification of our claim based on the Predictive, Descriptive, and Relevant (PDR) framework proposed by Murdoch et al. (2019). Specifically, by injecting human-interpretable patterns into the model, we increase the model’s descriptive accuracy by explicitly encoding useful relationships between input tokens in the attention weights while simultaneously improving the predictive accuracy in task performance. Further, the patterns are relevant for the problem since they are discovered in the human-in-the-loop process and are verified to be important for the task. Overall, with the discovered patterns injected,our models are arguably more interpretable thanplain transformers on both tasks, as we know with certaintythe information encoded in each masked/fixed attention heads. To further justify our claim of interpretability, the attention headswith patterns injectedtend to have higher importance scores than the other heads666An illustrative example is shown in Appendix C.1, suggesting that such patterns are effectively leveraged by the model. In the context of Machine Learning, interpretability can be defined as the description of the internals of a model in a way that is understandable to humans (Gilpin et al., 2018).With the rise of deep learning, various techniques have been proposed to interpret the inner workings of neural NLP models. For example, probing classifiers are often used for finding linguistic or knowledge information learned by neural networks (Conneau et al., 2018; Tenney et al., 2019; Pimentel et al., 2020; Voita and Titov, 2020; Hou and Sachan, 2021; Aghazadeh et al., 2022), while behaviour testing aims at understanding how models behave through inferences under different controlled settings (McCoy et al., 2019; Ross and Pavlick, 2019; Ribeiro et al., 2020; Koh et al., 2021; Goel et al., 2021).

1142,"What was the problem of previous work, R-CNN in terms of the efficiency?","The Region-based Convolutional Network method (R-CNN) [9] achieves excellent object detection accuracy by using a deep ConvNet to classify object proposals.R-CNN, however, has notable drawbacks:1.Training is a multi-stage pipeline.R-CNN first fine-tunes a ConvNet on object proposals using log loss.Then, it fits SVMs to ConvNet features.These SVMs act as object detectors, replacing the softmax classifier learnt by fine-tuning.In the third training stage, bounding-box regressors are learned.2.Training is expensive in space and time.For SVM and bounding-box regressor training, features are extracted from each object proposal in each image and written to disk.With very deep networks, such as VGG16, this process takes 2.5 GPU-days for the 5k images of the VOC07 trainval set.These features require hundreds of gigabytes of storage.3.Object detection is slow.At test-time, features are extracted from each object proposal in each test image.Detection with VGG16 takes 47s / image (on a GPU). R-CNN is slow because it performs a ConvNet forward pass for each object proposal, without sharing computation.Spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPPnets) [11] were proposed to speed up R-CNN by sharing computation.The SPPnet method computes a convolutional feature map for the entire input image and then classifies each object proposal using a feature vector extracted from the shared feature map.Features are extracted for a proposal by max-pooling the portion of the feature map inside the proposal into a fixed-size output (e.g., 6\times 6).Multiple output sizes are pooled and then concatenated as in spatial pyramid pooling [15].SPPnet accelerates R-CNN by 10 to 100\times at test time.Training time is also reduced by 3\times due to faster proposal feature extraction.",R-CNN needs multi-stage pipeline training and time consumes when evaluate them.,"A global key signature refers to a specific set of chords and their relationships that are associated with a particular key or tonality.

1147,How SPPnet address the drawback of R-CNN?,"R-CNN is slow because it performs a ConvNet forward pass for each object proposal, without sharing computation.Spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPPnets) [11] were proposed to speed up R-CNN by sharing computation.The SPPnet method computes a convolutional feature map for the entire input image and then classifies each object proposal using a feature vector extracted from the shared feature map.Features are extracted for a proposal by max-pooling the portion of the feature map inside the proposal into a fixed-size output (e.g., 6\times 6).Multiple output sizes are pooled and then concatenated as in spatial pyramid pooling [15].SPPnet accelerates R-CNN by 10 to 100\times at test time.Training time is also reduced by 3\times due to faster proposal feature extraction.","SPPnet computes a convolutional feature map for the entire input image and then classifies each object proposal using a feature vector extracted from the shared feature map.

Both char-level and word-level embeddings contribute towards the model’s performance. We conjecture that word-level embedding is better at representing the semantics of each word as a whole, while char-level embedding can better handle out-of-vocab (OOV) or rare words. To evaluate bi-directional attention, we remove C2Q and Q2C attentions. For ablating C2Q attention, we replace the attended question vector \tilde{\bf U} with the average of the output vectors of the question’s contextual embedding layer (LSTM). C2Q attention proves to be critical with a drop of more than 10 points on both metrics. For ablating Q2C attention, the output of the attention layer, {\bf G}, does not include terms that have the attended Q2C vectors, \tilde{\bf H}. To evaluate the attention flow, we study a dynamic attention model, where the attention is dynamically computed within the modeling layer’s LSTM, following previous work (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Wang & Jiang, 2016). This is in contrast with our approach, where the attention is pre-computed before flowing to the modeling layer. Despite being a simpler attention mechanism, our proposed static attention outperforms the dynamically computed attention by more than 3 points. We conjecture that separating out the attention layer results in a richer set of features computed in the first 4 layers which are then incorporated by the modeling layer.We also show the performance of BiDAF with several different definitions of \alpha and {\bm{\beta}} functions (Equation 1 and 2) in Appendix B.",They showed that.,"Sure!

1163,What is the difference between C2Q and Q2C?,"Context-to-query Attention.Context-to-query (C2Q) attention signifies which query words are most relevant to each context word.Let {\bf a}_{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{J} represent the attention weights on the query words by t-th context word, \sum{\bf a}_{tj}=1 for all t. The attention weight is computed by {\bf a}_{t}=\mathrm{softmax}({\bf S}_{t:})\in\mathbb{R}^{J},and subsequently each attended query vector is \tilde{{\bf U}}_{:t}=\sum_{j}{\bf a}_{tj}{\bf U}_{:j}.Hence \tilde{{\bf U}} is a 2d-by-T matrix containing the attended query vectors for the entire context. Query-to-context Attention.Query-to-context (Q2C) attention signifies which context words have the closest similarity to one of the query words and are hence critical for answering the query.

1164,Why did the author add one more direction in attention flow?,"In this paper, we introduce the Bi-Directional Attention Flow  (BiDAF) network, a hierarchical multi-stage architecture for modeling the representations of the context paragraph at different levels of granularity (Figure 1).BiDAF includes character-level, word-level, and contextual embeddings, and uses bi-directional attention flow to obtain a query-aware context representation.Our attention mechanism offers following improvements to the previously popular attention paradigms.First, our attention layer is not used to summarize the context paragraph into a fixed-size vector.Instead, the attention is computed for every time step, and the attended vector at each time step, along with the representations from previous layers, is allowed to flow through to the subsequent modeling layer.This reduces the information loss caused by early summarization.Second, we use a memory-less attention mechanism.That is, while we iteratively compute attention through time as in Bahdanau et al. (2015), the attention at each time step is a function of only the query and the context paragraph at the current time step and does not directly depend on the attention at the previous time step.We hypothesize that this simplification leads to the division of labor between the attention layer and the modeling layer.It forces the attention layer to focus on learning the attention between the query and the context, and enables the modeling layer to focus on learning the interaction within the query-aware context representation (the output of the attention layer).It also allows the attention at each time step to be unaffected from incorrect attendances at previous time steps.Our experiments show that memory-less attention gives a clear advantage over dynamic attention.Third, we use attention mechanisms in both directions, query-to-context and context-to-query, which provide complimentary information to each other. In this paper, we introduce BiDAF, a multi-stage hierarchical process that represents the context at different levels of granularity and uses a bi-directional attention flow mechanism to achieve a query-aware context representation without early summarization. The experimental evaluations show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art results in Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and CNN/DailyMail cloze test.

We follow the same setup as is done in Zhang & Li (2021), and adapt our GNN extractor to utilize the entire k-hop subgraph.The k-subgraph GNN extractor aggregates the updated node representations of all nodes within the k-hop neighborhood using a pooling function such as summation. Formally, if we denote by {\mathcal{N}}_{k}(u) the k-hop neighborhood of node u including itself, the representation of a node u is:\varphi(u,G)=\sum_{v\in{\mathcal{N}}_{k}(u)}\text{GNN}^{(k)}_{G}(v).(8)",Author extract entire k-hop subgraphs for each node.,"The availability of large-scale annotated datasets, such as ImageNet, and the revival of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have driven the remarkable progress in image recognition",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.231653567570066,5.423740175677549,0.0,0.0099009900990099,0.025492001324892,0.3707613587379456,0.025491964071989,0.2187914848327636,0.0155563004782746,0.3333333333333333,0.7345101257182826,0.7087791105665369
1170,what is limitations of gnns?,"While many different message-passing strategies have been proposed, some critical limitations have been uncovered in this class of GNNs. These include the limited expressiveness of GNNs (Xu et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2019), as well as known problems such as over-smoothing (Li et al., 2018, 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Oono & Suzuki, 2020) and over-squashing (Alon & Yahav, 2021).Over-smoothing manifests as all node representations converging to a constant after sufficiently many layers, while over-squashing occurs when messages from distant nodes are not effectively propagated through certain “bottlenecks” in a graph, since too many messages get compressed into a single fixed-length vector. Designing new architectures beyond neighborhood aggregation is thus essential to solve these problems. Message passing graph neural networks have recently been one of the leading methods for graph representation learning. An early seminal example is the GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017), which was based on performing convolutions on the graph. Gilmer et al. (2017) reformulated the early GNNs into a framework of message passing GNNs, which has since then become the predominant framework of GNNs in use today, with extensive examples (Hamilton et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019; Corso et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020b; Veličković et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020a; Yang et al., 2022). However, as mentioned above, they suffer from problems of limited expressiveness, over-smoothing, and over-squashing.","There are two most widely adopted limitations of GNNs : over-smoothing and over-squashing.
Over-smoothing is a phenomenon that indicates representations of GNNs get similar to each others as the number of layers increases.
Over-squashing is a difficulty of node representations to contain messages that come from distant neighbors.

1171,how the structure information of graphs different from the positional information of graphs?,"Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), which have proved to be successful in natural language understanding (Vaswani et al., 2017), computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), and biological sequence modeling (Rives et al., 2021), offer the potential to address these issues. Rather than only aggregating local neighborhood information in the message-passing mechanism, the Transformer architecture is able to capture interaction information between any node pair via a single self-attention layer.Moreover, in contrast to GNNs, the Transformer avoids introducing any structural inductive bias at intermediate layers, addressing the expressivity limitation of GNNs. Instead, it encodes structural or positional information about nodes only into input node features, albeit limiting how much information it can learn from the graph structure. Integrating information about the graph structure into the Transformer architecture has thus gained growing attention in the graph representation learning field. However, most existing approaches only encode positional relationships between nodes, rather than explicitly encoding the structural relationships. As a result, they may not identify structural similarities between nodes and could fail to model the structural interaction between nodes (see Figure 1). This could explain why their performance was dominated by sparse GNNs in several tasks (Dwivedi et al., 2022). We further argue that only using absolute positional encoding with the Transformer would exhibit a too relaxed structural inductive bias which is not guaranteed to generate similar node representations even if two nodes have similar local structures. This is due to the fact that distance or Laplacian-based positional representations generally serve as structural or positional signatures but do not provide a measure of structural similarity between nodes, especially in the inductive case where two nodes are from different graphs.

In contrast, the subgraph representations used in the structure-aware attention can be tailored to measure the structural similarity between nodes, and thus generate similar node-level representations if they possess similar attributes and surrounding structures. We can formally state this in the following theorem:","Structural information of graphs serves a measure of structural similarity between nodes.

1172,"What are the advantages of using relative encoding compared to absolute encoding, which performs well?","While the absolute encoding methods listed above can be used with message passing GNNs, they also play a crucial role in the (graph) Transformer architecture. Graph Transformer (Dwivedi & Bresson, 2021) provided an early example of how to generalize the Transformer architecture to graphs, using Laplacian eigenvectors as an absolute encoding and computing attention on the immediate neighborhood of each node, rather than on the full graph. SAN (Kreuzer et al., 2021) also used the Laplacian eigenvectors for computing an absolute encoding, but computed attention on the full graph, while distinguishing between true and created edges. Many graph Transformer methods also use a relative encoding (Shaw et al., 2018) in addition to absolute encoding. This strategy incorporates representations of the relative position or distances between nodes on the graph directly into the self-attention mechanism, as opposed to the absolute encoding which is only applied once to the input node features. Mialon et al. (2021) propose a relative encoding by means of kernels on graphs to bias the self-attention calculation, which is then able to incorporate positional information into Transformers via the choice of kernel function. Other recent work seeks to incorporate structural information into the graph Transformer, for example by encoding some carefully selected graph theoretic properties such as centrality measures and shortest path distances as positional representations (Ying et al., 2021) or by using GNNs to integrate the graph structure (Rong et al., 2020; Jain et al., 2021; Mialon et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2021).","The advantage of relative encoding compared to absolute encoding is the flexibility of using representations of position or distances into the self-attention mechanism directly.

1173,"What is the meaning of ""using graph structures explicitly""?","In this work, we address the critical question of how to encode structural information into a Transformer architecture. Our principal contribution is to introduce a flexible structure-aware self-attention mechanism that explicitly considers the graph structure and thus captures structural interaction between nodes. The resulting class of Transformers, which we call the Structure-Aware Transformer (SAT), can provide structure-aware representations of graphs, in contrast to most existing position-aware Transformers for graph-structured data. Specifically:•We reformulate the self-attention mechanism in Vaswani et al. (2017) as a kernel smoother andextend the original exponential kernel on node features to also account for local structures, by extracting a subgraph representation centered around each node.•We propose several methods for automatically generating the subgraph representations, enabling the resulting kernel smoother to simultaneously capture structural and attributed similarities between nodes. The resulting representations are theoretically guaranteed to be at least as expressive as the subgraph representations.•We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAT models on five graph and node property prediction benchmarks by showing it achieves better performance than state-of-the-art GNNs and Transformers. Furthermore, we show how SAT can easily leverage any GNN to compute the node representations which incorporate subgraph information and outperform the base GNN, making it an effortless enhancer of any existing GNN.•Finally, we show that we can attribute the performance gains to the structure-aware aspect of our architecture, and showcase how SAT is more interpretable than the classic Transformer with an absolute encoding. The key contribution of SAT is its ability to explicitly incorporate structural information in the self-attention. Here, we seek to demonstrate that this information provides crucial predictive information, and study how the choice of k affects the results. Figure 2(a) shows how the test MAE is impacted by varying k for k-subtree and k-subgraph extractors using PNA on the ZINC dataset. All models use the RWPE. k=0 corresponds to the vanilla Transformer only using absolute positional encoding, i.e. not using structure. We find that incorporating structural information leads to substantial improvement in performance, with optimal performance around k=3 for both k-subtree and k-subgraph extractors. As k increases beyond k=4, the performance in k-subtree extractors deteriorated, which is consistent with the observed phenomenon that GNNs work best in shallower networks (Kipf & Welling, 2017). We observe that k-subgraph does not suffer as much from this issue, underscoring a new aspect of its usefulness. On the other hand, k-subtree extractors are more computationally efficient and scalable to larger OGB datasets.","The meaning of using graph structures explicitly is to explicity incorporate structural information into the self-attention.
The reason is that both P3 and P7 state the main contribution of SAT with paraphrasing.
P3 indicates that to consider graph structure explicitly is a main idea of SAT, and P7 emphasizes it as to incorporate structural information in the self-attention.","Once the instance has been classified as a whole, it is sufficient to predict a binary mask without concern for the categories because the box branch has already accurately classified the instance, and the mask prediction can focus solely on the instance's boundaries without being influenced by the categories",0.1866666616675557,0.0,0.159999995000889,1.7480196349515862,23.317693292759355,20.07736715877492,0.1209585610200364,0.0086741016109045,0.0116543751209974,0.4183805885009987,0.087541714310646,0.5537845492362976,0.008170690457696,,0.7322536553114408,0.7359009899987515
1174,Can kernel functions other than the exponential kernel be applied?,"As presented above, self-attention in the Transformer can be rewritten as a kernel smoother where the kernel is a trainable exponential kernel defined on node features, and which only captures attributed similarity between a pair of nodes. The problem with this kernel smoother is that it cannot filter out nodes that are structurally different from the node of interest when they have the same or similar node features. In order to also incorporate the structural similarity between nodes, we consider a more generalized kernel that additionally accounts for the local substructures around each node. By introducing a set of subgraphs centered at each node, we define our structure-aware attention as:\text{SA-attn}(v):=\sum_{u\in V}\frac{\kappa_{\text{graph}}(S_{G}(v),S_{G}(u))}{\sum_{w\in V}\kappa_{\text{graph}}(S_{G}(v),S_{G}(w))}f(x_{u}),(5)where S_{G}(v) denotes a subgraph in G centered at a node v associated with node features \mathbf{X} and \kappa_{\text{graph}} can be any kernel that compares a pair of subgraphs. This new self-attention function not only takes the attributed similarity into account but also the structural similarity between subgraphs. It thus generates more expressive node representations than the original self-attention, as we will show in Section 4.4. Moreover, this self-attention is no longer equivariant to any permutation of nodes but only to nodes whose features and subgraphs coincide, which is a desirable property. In the rest of the paper, we will consider the following form of \kappa_{\text{graph}} that already includes a large class of expressive and computationally tractable models:\kappa_{\text{graph}}(S_{G}(v),S_{G}(u))=\kappa_{\exp}(\varphi(v,G),\varphi(u,G)),(6)where \varphi(u,G) is a structure extractor that extracts vector representations of some subgraph centered at u with node features \mathbf{X}. We provide several alternatives of the structure extractor below. It is worth noting that our structure-aware self-attention is flexible enough to be combined with any model that generates representations of subgraphs, including GNNs and (differentiable) graph kernels. For notational simplicity, we assume there are no edge attributes, but our method can easily incorporate edge attributes as long as the structure extractor can accommodate them. The edge attributes are consequently not considered in the self-attention computation, but are incorporated into the structure-aware node representations. In the structure extractors presented in this paper, this means that edge attributes were included whenever the base GNN was able to handle edge attributes.","Any kernel that compares a pair of subgraphs can replace the exponential kernel.

We respectively train a SAT model and a Transformer with a CLS readout on the Mutagenicity dataset, and visualize the attention scores between the [CLS] node and other nodes learned by SAT and the Transformer in Figure 4. The salient difference between the two models is that SAT has structure-aware node embeddings, and thus we can attribute the following interpretability gains to that. While both models manage to identify some chemical motifs known for mutagenicity, such as NO{}_{2} and NH{}_{2}, the attention scores learned by SAT are sparser and more informative, meaning that SAT puts more attention weights on these known mutagenic motifs than the Transformer with RWPE. The vanilla Transformer even fails to put attention on some important atoms such as the H atoms in the NH{}_{2} group. The only H atoms highlighted by SAT are those in the NH{}_{2} group, suggesting that our SAT indeed takes the structure into account.

Relations in these datasets need not necessarily encode directed subject-object relations, but are also used to encode the presence, or absence, of a specific feature for a given entity. In each dataset, the targets to be classified are properties of a group of entities represented as nodes. The exact statistics of the datasets can be found in Table 1. For a more detailed description of the datasets the reader is referred to ? (?). We remove relations that were used to create entity labels: employs and affiliation for AIFB, isMutagenic for MUTAG, hasLithogenesis for BGS, and objectCategory and material for AM.

We evaluate our algorithm on three node-classification benchmarks, which test GraphSAGE’s ability to generate useful embeddings on unseen data.We use two evolving document graphs based on citation data and Reddit post data (predicting paper and post categories, respectively), and a multi-graph generalization experiment based on a dataset of protein-protein interactions (predicting protein functions).Using these benchmarks, we show that our approach is able to effectively generate representations for unseen nodes and outperform relevant baselines by a significant margin: across domains, our supervised approach improves classification F1-scores by an average of 51% compared to using node features alone and GraphSAGE consistently outperforms a strong, transductive baseline [28], despite this baseline taking ∼100×{\sim}100\times∼ 100 × longer to run on unseen nodes.We also show that the new aggregator architectures we propose provide significant gains (7.4% on average) compared to an aggregator inspired by graph convolutional networks [17].Lastly, we probe the expressive capability of our approach and show, through theoretical analysis, that GraphSAGE is capable of learning structural information about a node’s role in a graph, despite the fact that it is inherently based on features (Section 5).","The roles of nodes can be their protein function or categories.

1206,How many experimental setting factors have been considered in experiments?,"Experimental set-up.To contextualize the empirical results on our inductive benchmarks, we compare against four baselines:a random classifer, a logistic regression feature-based classifier (that ignores graph structure), the DeepWalk algorithm [28] as a representative factorization-based approach, and aconcatenation of the raw features and DeepWalk embeddings.We also compare four variants of GraphSAGE that use the different aggregator functions (Section 3.3).Since, the “convolutional” variant of GraphSAGE is an extended, inductive version of Kipf et al’s semi-supervised GCN [17], we term this variant GraphSAGE-GCN.We test unsupervised variants of GraphSAGE  trained according to the loss in Equation (1), as well as supervised variants that are trained directly on classification cross-entropy loss.For all the GraphSAGE variants we used rectified linear units as the non-linearity and set K=2 with neighborhood sample sizes S_{1}=25 and S_{2}=10 (see Section 4.4 for sensitivity analyses). All models were implemented in TensorFlow [1] with the Adam optimizer [16] (except DeepWalk, which performed better with the vanilla gradient descent optimizer).We designed our experiments with the goals of (i) verifying the improvement of GraphSAGE over the baseline approaches (i.e., raw features and DeepWalk) and (ii) providing a rigorous comparison of the different GraphSAGE aggregator architectures.In order to provide a fair comparison, all models share an identical implementation of their minibatch iterators, loss function and neighborhood sampler (when applicable).Moreover, in order to guard against unintentional “hyperparameter hacking” in the comparisons between GraphSAGE aggregators, we sweep over the same set of hyperparameters for all GraphSAGE variants (choosing the best setting for each variant according to performance on a validation set).The set of possible hyperparameter values was determined on early validation tests using subsets of the citation and Reddit data that we then discarded from our analyses.The appendix contains further implementation details.555Code and links to the datasets: http://snap.stanford.edu/graphsage/","As far as my knowledge, seven factors are considered in experiments.

The most significant of which is app install advertisements (Gogel, 2018; Lee and Shin, 2016) and mobile app recommendations (Zhuet al., 2014). Yahoo posted a large scale prediction engine for app install advertising based on a two-step logistic regression model considering user features generated from behaviors on apps (Bhamidipatiet al., 2017). For reducing sparseness, Yahoo also classifies apps into predefined interest taxonomies when understanding app usage patterns (Radosavljevicet al., 2016). Usage patterns of apps are learned for app purchase recommendations with a Deep Memory Network(Gligorijevic et al., 2018). Beyond app install advertising, users’ app-installation behaviors are also used for news recommendations (Liuet al., 2017), where the knowledge of the neighborhood of the cold-start users is transferred from an APP domain to a new domain.A large survey on mobile app user behaviors across main app markets around the world was conducted to instruct cross-country app competitions and analyze the challenges for software engineering (Lim et al., 2014).

1211,"What does ""long-tailed app"" mean?","•Retention, installation and uninstallation need to be modeled collectively. They represent the preference of users from different aspects, and building representations for the three parts separately and then concatenating them may limit the performance. For example, for users who have installed multiple games, uninstalling a game app may only indicate that she has finished the game and wants to start a new one. While for a user who has not installed other games, immediately uninstalling after installation may suggest that she does not like this kind of game at all. Modeling such complex relationships using traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is challenging.•Actions of (un)installing apps are low-frequency and unevenly distributed over time. Figure 1 presents a demo of app installation and uninstallation records of a user. As excitement over the new phone fades, most users only install or uninstall apps when they need to. Moreover, users usually do not operate for even a month but may suddenly install or uninstall several apps in a single day. In this case, various intervals between every two behaviors are not omittable. Although RNN-based models have succeeded in analyzing user activities (Hidasi et al., 2016; Liet al., 2017), the behaviors in those scenarios are usually with notably higher-frequency and nearly even distribution over time. Therefore, traditional RNNs may not perform well for this task.•Many long-tailed apps suffer from serious sparsity. Popular apps like Wechat and Alipay have been installed on almost all the smartphones in China, while long-tailed apps may only have a few hundreds of installations among one million users. However, user’s behaviors over the long-tailed apps often reflect one’s personalized interests better. Building effective user representations need to utilize the information from long-tailed apps without suffering from severe sparsity.","Long-tailed application is a type of software or service that is not installed in a number of users. As it is installed in a few users, it can easily represent the properties and behaviors of users.","The retention autoencoder part helps to solve the sparsity problem by encoding retention into a low-dimensional dense encoding, \bm{x}^{(1)}, which plays an important role in the transformer encoder part",0.1153846103846156,0.0,0.1153846103846156,1.267244413387174,20.041467288728416,16.58456814192009,0.0511508951406649,0.0084572761738116,-0.0637998208403587,0.3759562639681026,0.0507970824837684,0.2204864770174026,0.0043012640249932,,0.6859325796898174,0.7055299765815501

1214,What are the two roles of autoencoder in proposed model?,"The role of this autoencoder is two-folds. Firstly, it helps to learn high-quality app embeddings from the co-occurrence relationship of apps. The weight matrix of the first hidden layer \mathbf{W}^{(1)} acts as the shared app embedding matrix \mathbf{W}^{a} for the whole network, i.e., we have(2)\mathbf{W}^{a}=\mathbf{W}^{(1)}\in\mathbb{R}^{M\times{d_{model}}}.To further alleviate the problem of sparsity, the shared app embedding matrix is carefully designed and tied with some other weight matrices. More details are provided in Section 4.3. Secondly, this autoencoder provides effective representations of user retention for the transformer part. The transformer encoder part needs to be fed with the retention for compressing long-term interests into user embeddings. However, retention is originally in the form of high-dimensional sparse features. This autoencoder encodes retention into the first hidden layer \bm{x}^{(1)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{model}}. As a low-dimensional dense encoding, \bm{x}^{(1)} plays an important role in the transformer encoder part.","Two roles of autoencoder in proposed models are to help to learn co-occurunce relationship among applications and to help transformer encoder to learn effective user retention representations.
The reason is that autoencoder helps to learn high-quality app embeddings from the co-occurrence relationship.
Meanwhile, the autoencoder helps transformers to encode effective low-dimensional representations.","Sure! Here's my answer:

1215,Which part of the proposed model helps to solve the sparsity problem?,"Secondly, this autoencoder provides effective representations of user retention for the transformer part. The transformer encoder part needs to be fed with the retention for compressing long-term interests into user embeddings. However, retention is originally in the form of high-dimensional sparse features. This autoencoder encodes retention into the first hidden layer \bm{x}^{(1)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{model}}. As a low-dimensional dense encoding, \bm{x}^{(1)} plays an important role in the transformer encoder part. We carefully design our weight matrices for several parts of the model, which helps to solve the sparsity problem and tightly couple the autoencoder part and the transformer parts. As shown in Figure 5, the app embeddings are built based on both the app ID and its corresponding category ID. Even if the usage of some app is gravely sparse, its category can still provide valid information. This setting helps to overcome the problem of sparsity. As introduced previously, we repeatedly use the M\times d_{model} embedding matrix for apps, i.e., at the input and output of the retention autoencoder, the input of the transformer encoder, the output for the masked app prediction, the output of the transformer decoder, as well as the reconstruction part for retention from the user embeddings (bottleneck). We tie the weight matrices of all these parts together, i.e.,(3)\displaystyle\mathbf{W}^{\Omega}=\mathbf{W}^{\Theta}=\mathbf{W}^{\Phi}=\mathbf{W}^{(4)}={\mathbf{W}^{a}}^{\mathrm{T}}.We reduce the total number of parameters by tying weight matrices of the above layers, which benefits of overcoming the problem of sparsity. Moreover, weight tying benefits the backpropagation of the gradient and speeds the convergence.","Both transformers and retention autoencoder parts try to solve the sparsity problem by using tied weight matrices.
The reason of this is that \mathbf{W}^{\Omega}=\mathbf{W}^{\Theta}=\mathbf{W}^{\Phi}=\mathbf{W}^{(4)}={\mathbf{W}^{a}}^{\mathrm{T}}. 
Since \mathbf{W}^{\Omega} is used in transformer part and \mathbf{W}^{(4)} is used in autoencoder part, both of them try to solve the sparsity problem.","GATs allow for (implicitly) assigning different importances to nodes of a same neighborhood, whereas GCNs assume all neighbors have equal importance",0.0727272680066118,0.0,0.0727272680066118,0.4208068144472901,19.141703679284067,15.65894037697371,0.0276243093922651,0.0046449900464499,0.1004261225461959,0.3093913214177077,0.0728421136736869,0.465670645236969,0.0034454967217051,0.0,0.7355618287745672,0.745246116945518

1217,Are the three stages sequentially conducted in the model?,"The first learning stage is to use basic level masking, It treat a sentence as a sequence of basic Language unit, for English, the basic language unit is word, and for Chinese, the basic language unit is Chinese Character. In the training process, We randomly mask 15 percents of basic language units, and using other basic units in the sentence as inputs, and train a transformer to predict the mask units.Based on basic level mask, we can obtain a basic word representation. Because it is trained on a random mask of basic semantic units, high level semantic knowledge is hard to be fully modeled. The second stage is to employ phrase-level masking. Phrase is a small group of words or characters together acting as a conceptual unit. For English, we use lexical analysis and chunking tools to get the boundary of phrases in the sentences, and use some language dependent segmentation tools to get the word/phrase information in other language such as Chinese. In phrase-level mask stage, we also use basic language units as training input, unlike random basic units mask, this time we randomly select a few phrases in the sentence, mask and predict all the basic units in the same phrase.

1218,How did ERINE model incorporate knowledge into the language model?,"In this paper, we propose a model called ERNIE (enhanced representation through knowledge integration) by using knowledge masking strategies. In addition to basic masking strategy, we use two kinds of knowledge strategies: phrase-level strategy and entity-level strategy. We take a phrase or a entity as one unit, which is usually composed of several words. All of the words in the same unit are masked during word representation training, instead of only one word or character being masked. In this way, the prior knowledge of phrases and entities are implicitly learned during the training procedure.Instead of adding the knowledge embedding directly, ERNIE implicitly learned the information about knowledge and longer semantic dependency, such as the relationship between entities, the property of a entity and the type of a event, to guide word embedding learning.

The reasoning for this is due to several aspects of the Make-A-Video method:

1. Bypassing the need for paired text-video data: Make-A-Video leverages joint text-image priors to extend a diffusion-based T2I model to T2V, which allows for potentially scaling to larger quantities of video data. This sets it apart from prior works that are restricted to narrow domains or require large-scale paired text-video data.
2. Fine-tuning the T2I model for video generation: Make-A-Video fine-tunes the T2I model for video generation, which adapts the model weights effectively and gain an advantage over freezing the weights as in CogVideo.
3. Efficient architecture: Make-A-Video uses a pseudo-3D convolution and temporal attention layers, which better leverage a T2I architecture and allow for better temporal information fusion compared to VDM.

It is easy for the model to predict the missing word of the entity  Harry Potter by word collocations inside this entity without the help of long contexts.The model cannot predict  Harry Potter according to the relationship between  Harry Potter and J.

1224,"Compared with phrase-level masking, what are the advantages of entity-level phrase?","In this paper, we propose a model called ERNIE (enhanced representation through knowledge integration) by using knowledge masking strategies. In addition to basic masking strategy, we use two kinds of knowledge strategies: phrase-level strategy and entity-level strategy. We take a phrase or a entity as one unit, which is usually composed of several words. All of the words in the same unit are masked during word representation training, instead of only one word or character being masked. In this way, the prior knowledge of phrases and entities are implicitly learned during the training procedure.Instead of adding the knowledge embedding directly, ERNIE implicitly learned the information about knowledge and longer semantic dependency, such as the relationship between entities, the property of a entity and the type of a event, to guide word embedding learning. This can make the model have better generalization and adaptability.","Compared to entity-level masking, phrase-level masking make models have better generalization and adaptability.

1225,What is the instance of 'paired examples'?,"This problem can be more broadly described as image-to-image translation [22], converting an image from one representation of a given scene, x, to another, y, e.g., grayscale to color, image to semantic labels, edge-map to photograph.Years of research in computer vision, image processing, computational photography, and graphics have produced powerful translation systems in the supervised setting, where example image pairs \{x_{i},y_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N} are available (Figure 2, left), e.g.,[11, 19, 22, 23, 28, 33, 45, 56, 58, 62].However, obtaining paired training data can be difficult and expensive. For example, only a couple of datasets exist for tasks like semantic segmentation (e.g., [4]), and they are relatively small.Obtaining input-output pairs for graphics tasks like artistic stylization can be even more difficult since the desired output is highly complex, typically requiring artistic authoring. For many tasks, like object transfiguration (e.g., zebra\leftrightarrowhorse,  Figure 1 top-middle), the desired output is not even well-defined. Figure 8 shows some example results on other paired datasets used in “pix2pix” [22], such as architectural labels\leftrightarrowphotos from the CMP Facade Database [40], and edges\leftrightarrowshoes from the UT Zappos50Kdataset [60]. The image quality of our results is close to those produced by the fully supervised pix2pix while our method learns the mapping without paired supervision.","[Paired training data consists of training examples ({xi, yi}^N i=1), where the correspondence between xi

1226,What is the definition of 'cycle consistency loss'?,"Cycle ConsistencyThe idea of using transitivity as a way to regularize structured data has a long history. In visual tracking, enforcing simple forward-backward consistency has been a standard trick for decades [24, 48]. In the language domain, verifying and improving translations via “back translation and reconciliation” is a technique used by human translators [3] (including, humorously, by Mark Twain [51]), as well as by machines [17].More recently, higher-order cycle consistency has been used instructure from motion [61],3D shape matching [21], co-segmentation [55], dense semantic alignment [65, 64], and depth estimation [14]. Of these, Zhou et al. [64] and Godard et al. [14] are most similar to our work, as they use a cycle consistency loss as a way of using transitivity to supervise CNN training.In this work, we are introducing a similar loss to push G and F to be consistent with each other. Concurrent with our work, in these same proceedings, Yi et al. [59] independently use a similar objective for unpaired image-to-image translation, inspired by dual learning in machine translation [17]. Adversarial training can, in theory, learn mappings G and F that produce outputs identically distributed as target domains Y and X respectively (strictly speaking, this requires G and F to be stochastic functions) [15]. However, with large enough capacity, a network can map the same set of input images to any random permutation of images in the target domain, where any of the learned mappings can induce an output distribution that matches the target distribution. Thus, adversarial losses alone cannot guarantee that the learned function can map an individual input x_{i} to a desired output y_{i}. To further reduce the space of possible mapping functions, we argue that the learned mapping functions should be cycle-consistent: as shown in Figure 3 (b), for each image x from domain X, the image translation cycle should be able to bring x back to the original image, i.e., x\rightarrow G(x)\rightarrow F(G(x))\approx x. We call this forward cycle consistency. Similarly, as illustrated in Figure 3 (c), for each image y from domain Y, G and F should also satisfy backward cycle consistency: y\rightarrow F(y)\rightarrow G(F(y))\approx y.We incentivize this behavior using a cycle consistency loss:\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{\text{cyc}}(G,F)=\displaystyle\ \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{\text{data}}(x)}[\lVert F(G(x))-x\rVert_{1}]\displaystyle+\displaystyle\ \mathbb{E}_{y\sim p_{\text{data}}(y)}[\lVert G(F(y))-y\rVert_{1}].(2)In preliminary experiments, we also tried replacing the L1 norm in this loss with an adversarial loss between F(G(x)) and x, and between G(F(y)) and y, but did not observe improved performance. These issues call for adding more structure to our objective. Therefore, we exploit the property that translation should be “cycle consistent”, in the sense that if we translate, e.g., a sentence from English to French, and then translate it back from French to English, we should arrive back at the original sentence [3]. Mathematically, if we have a translator G:X\rightarrow Y and another translator F:Y\rightarrow X, then G and F should be inverses of each other, and both mappings should be bijections. We apply this structural assumption by training both the mapping G and F simultaneously, and adding a cycle consistency loss [64] that encourages F(G(x))\approx x and G(F(y))\approx y. Combining this loss with adversarial losses on domains X and Y yields our full objective for unpaired image-to-image translation.","[Cyclic consistency implies that for each image x from domain X, the image translation cycle should be able to bring x back to the original image. The data can be of any nature other than an image as well.]","BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr-D, SPICE, R{}_{\text{V}}, R{}_{\text{SR1}}, R{}_{\text{SR2}}, Div-n, and self-CIDEr",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7260966982351943,4.2006708752438,3.6651481814434415,0.0112866817155756,0.0028125799028381,0.0689391121268272,0.1030785284423525,0.1482515484094619,0.0343912951648235,0.0107557039093238,1.0,0.7023064496902508,0.7337984461146776

Figure 17 shows several typical failure cases. On translation tasks that involve color and texture changes, as many of those reported above, the method often succeeds. We have also explored tasks that require geometric changes, with little success. For example, on the task of dog\rightarrowcat transfiguration, the learned translation degenerates into making minimal changes to the input (Figure 17). This failure might be caused by our generator architectures which are tailored for good performance on the appearance changes. Handling more varied and extreme transformations, especially geometric changes, is an important problem for future work. Some failure cases are caused by the distribution characteristics of the training datasets.

1230,How can we check if the model suffers from mode collapse?,"In Table 4 and Table 5, we compare against ablations of our full loss. Removing the GAN loss substantially degrades results, as does removing the cycle-consistency loss. We therefore conclude that both terms are critical to our results. We also evaluate our method with the cycle loss in only one direction: GAN + forward cycle loss \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{\text{data}}(x)}[\lVert F(G(x))-x\rVert_{1}], or GAN + backward cycle loss \mathbb{E}_{y\sim p_{\text{data}}(y)}[\lVert G(F(y))-y\rVert_{1}] (Equation 2) and find that it often incurs training instability and causes mode collapse, especially for the direction of the mapping that was removed. Figure 7 shows several qualitative examples. [We therefore seek an algorithm that can learn to translate between domains without paired input-output examples (Figure 2, right). We assume there is some underlying relationship between the domains – for example, that they are two different renderings of the same underlying scene – and seek to learn that relationship.

We may train a mapping G : X → Y such that the output yˆ = G(x), x ∈ X, is indistinguishable from images y ∈ Y by an adversary trained to classify yˆ apart from y. In theory, this objective can induce an output distribution over yˆ that matches the empirical distribution pdata(y) (in general, this requires G to be stochastic). The optimal G thereby translates the domain X to a domain Yˆ distributed identically to Y . However, such a translation does not guarantee that an individual input x and output y are paired up in a meaningful way – there are infinitely many mappings G that will induce the same distribution over yˆ.

2. Training CNNs using both single frames and multiple frames with five scales as input [273].
3. Applying LSTM units on top of CNN to obtain end-to-end features for recognizing spoofing faces [274].

5. Inversely decomposing spoof faces into live faces and spoof noise patterns [277].
6. Detecting adversarial samples by characterizing abnormal filter response behavior in the hidden layers and removing the most problematic filters [280].
7. Providing open source implementations of adversarial detection and mitigation algorithms [281].

1235,Would 'bijection' always be guaranteed in this case?,"These issues call for adding more structure to our objective. Therefore, we exploit the property that translation should be “cycle consistent”, in the sense that if we translate, e.g., a sentence from English to French, and then translate it back from French to English, we should arrive back at the original sentence [3]. Mathematically, if we have a translator G:X\rightarrow Y and another translator F:Y\rightarrow X, then G and F should be inverses of each other, and both mappings should be bijections. We apply this structural assumption by training both the mapping G and F simultaneously, and adding a cycle consistency loss [64] that encourages F(G(x))\approx x and G(F(y))\approx y. Combining this loss with adversarial losses on domains X and Y yields our full objective for unpaired image-to-image translation.","If there is a translator G:X\rightarrow Y and another translator F:Y\rightarrow X, then G and F should be inverses of each other, and both mappings should be bijections.

1236,What is the definition of 'translate'?,"This problem can be more broadly described as image-to-image translation [22], converting an image from one representation of a given scene, x, to another, y, e.g., grayscale to color, image to semantic labels, edge-map to photograph.Years of research in computer vision, image processing, computational photography, and graphics have produced powerful translation systems in the supervised setting, where example image pairs \{x_{i},y_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N} are available (Figure 2, left), e.g.,[11, 19, 22, 23, 28, 33, 45, 56, 58, 62].However, obtaining paired training data can be difficult and expensive. For example, only a couple of datasets exist for tasks like semantic segmentation (e.g., [4]), and they are relatively small.Obtaining input-output pairs for graphics tasks like artistic stylization can be even more difficult since the desired output is highly complex, typically requiring artistic authoring. For many tasks, like object transfiguration (e.g., zebra\leftrightarrowhorse,  Figure 1 top-middle), the desired output is not even well-defined.","[To ""translate"" an image means  to convert an image from one representation of a given scene to another, e.g., grayscale to color, image to semantic labels, etc. ]","Yes.

1237,Could we guess more about what is the instance of 'underlying relationship'?,"We therefore seek an algorithm that can learn to translate between domains without paired input-output examples (Figure 2, right). We assume there is some underlying relationship between the domains – for example, that they are two different renderings of the same underlying scene – and seek to learn that relationship. Although we lack supervision in the form of paired examples, we can exploit supervision at the level of sets: we are given one set of images in domain X and a different set in domain Y. We may train a mapping G:X\rightarrow Y such that the output \hat{y}=G(x), x\in X, is indistinguishable from images y\in Y by an adversary trained to classify \hat{y} apart from y. In theory, this objective can induce an output distribution over \hat{y} that matches the empirical distribution p_{data}(y) (in general, this requires G to be stochastic) [16]. The optimal G thereby translates the domain X to a domain \hat{Y} distributed identically to Y.

1240,"Normally, GAN training is unstable. Does this framework help to make the model stable?","We apply two techniques from recent works to stabilize our model training procedure. First, for \mathcal{L}_{\text{GAN}} (Equation 1), we replace the negative log likelihood objective by a least-squares loss [35]. This loss is more stable during training and generates higher quality results. In particular, for a GAN loss \mathcal{L}_{\text{GAN}}(G,D,X,Y), we train the G to minimize \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{\text{data}}(x)}[(D(G(x))-1)^{2}] and train the D to minimize \mathbb{E}_{y\sim p_{\text{data}}(y)}[(D(y)-1)^{2}]+\mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{\text{data}}(x)}[D(G(x))^{2}]. Second, to reduce model oscillation [15], we follow Shrivastava et al.’s strategy [46] and update the discriminators using a history of generated images rather than the ones produced by thelatest generators. We keep an image buffer that stores the 50 previously created images. In Table 4 and Table 5, we compare against ablations of our full loss. Removing the GAN loss substantially degrades results, as does removing the cycle-consistency loss. We therefore conclude that both terms are critical to our results. We also evaluate our method with the cycle loss in only one direction: GAN + forward cycle loss \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{\text{data}}(x)}[\lVert F(G(x))-x\rVert_{1}], or GAN + backward cycle loss \mathbb{E}_{y\sim p_{\text{data}}(y)}[\lVert G(F(y))-y\rVert_{1}] (Equation 2) and find that it often incurs training instability and causes mode collapse, especially for the direction of the mapping that was removed. Figure 7 shows several qualitative examples.","[The paper applies two techniques to stabilize its model training procedure.

Our approach, prototypical networks, is based on the idea that there exists an embedding in which points cluster around a single prototype representation for each class.

1243,What is the definition of 'episodes'?,"Two recent approaches have made significant progress in few-shot learning.Vinyals et al. (2016) proposed matching networks, which uses an attention mechanism over a learned embedding of the labeled set of examples (the support set) to predict classes for the unlabeled points (the query set). Matching networks can be interpreted as a weighted nearest-neighbor classifier applied within an embedding space. Notably, this model utilizes sampled mini-batches called episodes during training, where each episode is designed to mimic the few-shot task by subsampling classes as well as data points. The use of episodes makes the training problem more faithful to the test environment and thereby improves generalization.Ravi and Larochelle (2017) take the episodic training idea further and propose a meta-learning approach to few-shot learning. Their approach involves training an LSTM Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) to produce the updates to a classifier, given an episode, such that it will generalize well to a test-set. Here, rather than training a single model over multiple episodes, the LSTM meta-learner learns to train a custom model for each episode. Prototypical networks compute an M-dimensional representation \mathbf{c}_{k}\in\mathbb{R}^{M}, or prototype, of each class through an embedding function f_{\bm{\phi}}:\mathbb{R}^{D}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{M} with learnable parameters \bm{\phi}.

Training episodes are formed by randomly selecting a subset of classes from the training set, then choosing a subset of examples within each class to act as the support set and a subset of the remainder to serve as query points.

1254,"In related work, what is the most relevant method to this paper?","The literature on metric learning is vast (Kulis, 2012; Bellet et al., 2013); we summarize here the work most relevant to our proposed method. Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) (Goldberger et al., 2004) learns a Mahalanobis distance to maximize K-nearest-neighbor’s (KNN) leave-one-out accuracy in the transformed space.Salakhutdinov and Hinton (2007) extend NCA by using a neural network to perform the transformation. Large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) classification (Weinberger et al., 2005) also attempts to optimize KNN accuracy but does so using a hinge loss that encourages the local neighborhood of a point to contain other points with the same label. The DNet-KNN (Min et al., 2009) is another margin-based method that improves upon LMNN by utilizing a neural network to perform the embedding instead of a simple linear transformation. Of these, our method is most similar to the non-linear extension of NCA (Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2007) because we use a neural network to perform the embedding and we optimize a softmax based on Euclidean distances in the transformed space, as opposed to a margin loss. A key distinction between our approach and non-linear NCA is that we form a softmax directly over classes, rather than individual points, computed from distances to each class’s prototype representation. This allows each class to have a concise representation independent of the number of data points and obviates the need to store the entire support set to make predictions.","[The paper’s method is most similar to the non-linear extension of NCA because the paper uses a neural network to perform the embedding and optimizes a softmax based on Euclidean distances in the transformed space, as opposed to a margin loss.]",No,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3584905660377355,1.572327044025157,0.0,0.0002438429651304,0.0184675026684999,0.2637174725532532,0.0184675343334674,,0.0003246981072995,,0.0,0.7266967541144604

1256,What distance metric this paper uses,"In convolutional neural networks, a local region of a pixel consists of pixels with array indices within certain Manhattan distance (kernel size) of the pixel. In a point set sampled from a metric space, the neighborhood of a point is defined by metric distance. A few very recent works [20, 28] have studied how to apply deep learning to unordered sets. They ignore the underlying distance metric even if the point set does possess one. As a result, they are unable to capture local context of points and are sensitive to global set translation and normalization. In this work, we target at points sampled from a metric space and tackle these issues by explicitly considering the underlying distance metric in our design. Suppose that \mathcal{X}=(M,d) is a discrete metric space whose metric is inherited from a Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{n}, where M\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n} is the set of points and d is the distance metric. In addition, the density of M in the ambient Euclidean space may not be uniform everywhere. We are interested in learning set functions f that take such \mathcal{X} as the input (along with additional features for each point) and produce information of semantic interest regrading \mathcal{X}.

1273,What is the definition of 'task'?,"Few-shot learning is well-studied in the domain of supervised tasks, where the goal is to learn a new function from only a few input/output pairs for that task, using prior data from similar tasks for meta-learning. For example, the goal might be to classify images of a Segway after seeing only one or a few examples of a Segway, with a model that has previously seen many other types of objects. Likewise, in few-shot regression, the goal is to predict the outputs of a continuous-valued function from only a few datapoints sampled from that function, after training on many functions with similar statistical properties. We consider a model, denoted f, that maps observations \mathbf{x} to outputs \mathbf{a}.During meta-learning, the modelis trained to be able to adapt to a large or infinite number of tasks.Since we would like to apply our framework to a variety of learning problems, from classification to reinforcement learning, we introduce a generic notion of a learning task below.Formally, each task \mathcal{T}=\{\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{a}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{x}_{H},\mathbf{a}_{H}),q(\mathbf{x}_{1}),q(\mathbf{x}_{t+1}|\mathbf{x}_{t},\mathbf{a}_{t}),H\}consists of a loss function \mathcal{L}, a distribution over initial observations q(\mathbf{x}_{1}), a transition distribution q(\mathbf{x}_{t+1}|\mathbf{x}_{t},\mathbf{a}_{t}), and an episode length H. In i.i.d. supervised learning problems, the length H\!=\!1.The model may generate samples of length H by choosing an output \mathbf{a}_{t} at each time t.The loss \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{a}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{x}_{H},\mathbf{a}_{H})\rightarrow\mathbb{R}, provides task-specific feedback, which might be in the form of a misclassification loss or a cost function in a Markov decision process.","Task means what the agent wants to learn.

1274,What is the definition of 'meta-learning'?,"Learning quickly is a hallmark of human intelligence, whether it involves recognizing objects from a few examples or quickly learning new skillsafter just minutes of experience. Our artificial agents should be able to do the same, learning and adapting quickly from only a few examples, and continuing to adapt as more data becomes available. This kind of fast and flexible learning is challenging, since the agent must integrate its prior experience with a small amount of new information, while avoiding overfitting to the new data. Furthermore, the form of prior experience and new data will depend on the task. As such, for the greatest applicability, the mechanism for learning to learn (or meta-learning) should be general to the task and the form of computation required to complete the task. In this work, we propose a meta-learning algorithm that is general and model-agnostic, in the sense that it can be directly applied to any learning problem and model that is trained with a gradient descent procedure. Our focus is on deep neural network models, but we illustrate how our approach can easily handle different architectures and different problem settings, including classification, regression, and policy gradient reinforcement learning, with minimal modification.In meta-learning, the goal of the trained model is to quickly learn a new task from a small amount of new data, and the model istrained by the meta-learner to be able to learn on a large number of different tasks.The key idea underlying our method is totrain the model’s initial parameters such that the model has maximal performance on a new task after the parameters have been updatedthrough one or more gradient steps computed with a small amount of data from that new task.Unlike prior meta-learning methods that learn an update function or learning rule (Schmidhuber, 1987; Bengio et al., 1992; Andrychowicz et al., 2016; Ravi & Larochelle, 2017), our algorithm does not expand the number of learned parameters nor place constraints on the model architecture (e.g. by requiring a recurrent model (Santoro et al., 2016) or a Siamese network (Koch, 2015)), and it can be readily combined with fully connected, convolutional, or recurrent neural networks. It can also be used with a variety of loss functions, including differentiable supervised losses and non-differentiable reinforcement learning objectives.  In reinforcement learning (RL), the goal of few-shot meta-learning is to enable an agent to quickly acquire a policy for a new test task using only a small amount of experience in the test setting. A new task might involve achieving a new goal or succeeding on a previously trained goal in a new environment. For example, an agent might learn to quickly figure out how to navigate mazes so that, when faced with a new maze, it can determine how to reliably reach the exit with only a few samples.In this section, we will discuss how MAML can be applied to meta-learning for RL. All of the meta-learning problems that we consider require some amount of adaptation to new tasks at test-time. When possible, we compare our results to an oracle that receives the identity of the task (which is a problem-dependent representation) as an additional input, as an upper bound on the performance of the model. All of the experiments were performed using TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2016), which allows for automatic differentiation through the gradient update(s) during meta-learning. The code is available online111Code for the regression and supervised experiments is at github.com/cbfinn/maml and code for the RL experiments is at github.com/cbfinn/maml_rl. The primary contribution of this work is a simple model- and task-agnostic algorithm for meta-learning that trains a model’s parameters such that a small number of gradient updates will lead to fast learning on a new task.We demonstrate the algorithm on different model types, including fully connected and convolutional networks, and in several distinct domains, including few-shot regression, image classification, and reinforcement learning.Our evaluation shows that our meta-learning algorithm compares favorably to state-of-the-art one-shot learning methods designed specifically for supervised classification, while using fewer parameters, but that it can also be readily applied to regression and can accelerate reinforcement learning in the presence of task variability, substantially outperforming direct pretraining as initialization. The goal of few-shot meta-learningis to train a model that can quickly adapt to a new task using only a few datapoints and training iterations.To accomplish this, the model or learner is trained during a meta-learning phase on a set of tasks, such that the trained model can quickly adapt to new tasks using only a small number of examples or trials.In effect, the meta-learning problem treats entire tasks as training examples.In this section, we formalize this meta-learning problem setting in a general manner, including brief examples of different learning domains.We will discuss two different learning domains in detail in Section 3. We consider a model, denoted f, that maps observations \mathbf{x} to outputs \mathbf{a}.During meta-learning, the modelis trained to be able to adapt to a large or infinite number of tasks.Since we would like to apply our framework to a variety of learning problems, from classification to reinforcement learning, we introduce a generic notion of a learning task below.Formally, each task \mathcal{T}=\{\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{a}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{x}_{H},\mathbf{a}_{H}),q(\mathbf{x}_{1}),q(\mathbf{x}_{t+1}|\mathbf{x}_{t},\mathbf{a}_{t}),H\}consists of a loss function \mathcal{L}, a distribution over initial observations q(\mathbf{x}_{1}), a transition distribution q(\mathbf{x}_{t+1}|\mathbf{x}_{t},\mathbf{a}_{t}), and an episode length H. In i.i.d. supervised learning problems, the length H\!=\!1.The model may generate samples of length H by choosing an output \mathbf{a}_{t} at each time t.The loss \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{a}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{x}_{H},\mathbf{a}_{H})\rightarrow\mathbb{R}, provides task-specific feedback, which might be in the form of a misclassification loss or a cost function in a Markov decision process.",Meta-learning is a learning method that enables a model to quickly adapt to tasks during learning.

1275,What type of parameter would be considered a 'good' initial parameter?,"The process of training a model’s parameters such that a few gradient steps, or even a single gradient step, can produce good results on a new task can be viewed from a feature learning standpoint as building an internal representation that is broadly suitable for many tasks. If the internal representation is suitable to many tasks, simply fine-tuning the parameters slightly (e.g. by primarily modifying the top layer weights in a feedforward model) can produce good results. In effect, our procedure optimizes for models that are easy and fast to fine-tune, allowing the adaptation to happen in the right space for fast learning. From a dynamical systems standpoint, our learning process can be viewed as maximizing the sensitivity of the loss functions of new tasks with respect to the parameters: when the sensitivity is high, small local changes to the parameters can lead to large improvements in the task loss. Our approach is also related to methods for initialization of deep networks. In computer vision, models pretrained on large-scale image classification have been shown to learn effective features for a range of problems (Donahue et al., 2014). In contrast, our method explicitly optimizes the model for fast adaptability, allowing it to adapt to new tasks with only a few examples.Our method can also be viewed as explicitly maximizing sensitivity of new task losses to the model parameters.A number of prior works have explored sensitivity in deep networks, often in the context of initialization (Saxe et al., 2014; Kirkpatrick et al., 2016). Most of these works have considered good random initializations, though a number of papers have addressed data-dependent initializers (Krähenbühl et al., 2016; Salimans & Kingma, 2016), including learned initializations (Husken & Goerick, 2000; Maclaurin et al., 2015). In contrast, our method explicitly trains the parameters for sensitivity on a given task distribution, allowing for extremely efficient adaptation for problems such as K-shot learning and rapid reinforcement learning in only one or a few gradient steps. In contrast to prior work, which has sought to train recurrent neural networks that ingest entire datasets (Santoro et al., 2016; Duan et al., 2016b) or feature embeddings that can be combined with nonparametric methods at test time (Vinyals et al., 2016; Koch, 2015), we propose a method that can learn the parameters of any standard model via meta-learning in such a way as to prepare that model for fast adaptation. The intuition behind this approach is that some internal representations are more transferrable than others. For example, a neural network might learn internal features that are broadly applicable to all tasks in p(\mathcal{T}), rather than a single individual task. How can we encourage the emergence of such general-purpose representations? We take an explicit approach to this problem: since the model will be fine-tuned using a gradient-based learning rule on a new task, we will aim to learn a model in such a way that this gradient-based learning rule can make rapid progress on new tasks drawn from p(\mathcal{T}), without overfitting. In effect, we will aim to find model parameters that are sensitive to changes in the task, such that small changes in the parameters will produce large improvements on the loss function of any task drawn from p(\mathcal{T}), when altered in the direction of the gradient of that loss (see Figure 1). We make no assumption on the form of the model, other than to assume that it is parametrized by some parameter vector \theta, and that the loss function is smooth enough in \theta that we can use gradient-based learning techniques.","A good initial parameter is a parameter that gives good performance in many tasks even with a little fine-tuning of the parameter.

1276,Is it true that this paper's learning process can be viewed as maximizing the sensitivity of the loss functions of new tasks with respect to the parameters?,"The model parameters are trained by optimizing for the performance of f_{\theta_{i}^{\prime}} with respect to \theta across tasks sampled from p(\mathcal{T}).More concretely, the meta-objective is as follows:\displaystyle\vspace{-0.2cm}\min_{\theta}\sum_{\mathcal{T}_{i}\sim p(\mathcal{T})}\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_{i}}(f_{\theta_{i}^{\prime}})=\sum_{\mathcal{T}_{i}\sim p(\mathcal{T})}\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_{i}}(f_{\theta-\alpha\nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_{i}}(f_{\theta})})Note that the meta-optimization is performed over the model parameters \theta, whereas the objective is computed using the updated model parameters \theta^{\prime}.In effect, our proposed method aims to optimize the model parameters such that one or a small number of gradient steps on a new task will produce maximally effective behavior on that task.

1277,Why meta learning is better than transfer learning?,"We introduced a meta-learning method based on learning easily adaptable model parameters through gradient descent. Our approach has a number of benefits. It is simple and does not introduce any learned parameters for meta-learning. It can be combined with any model representation that is amenable to gradient-based training, and any differentiable objective, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. Lastly, since our method merely produces a weight initialization, adaptation can be performed with any amount of data and any number of gradient steps, though we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on classification with only one or five examples per class. We also show that our method can adapt an RL agent using policy gradients and a very modest amount of experience.","While transfer learning requires learned parameters, meta-learning does not require learned parameters.","Both SSD and YOLO use multi-scale feature maps for detection, but they differ in the number of scales and the size of the feature maps.

1278,How could the algorithm infer amplitude and phase in the case of showing only half of the input range?,"We evaluate performance by fine-tuning the model learned by MAML and the pretrained model on K=\{5,10,20\} datapoints. During fine-tuning, each gradient step is computed using the same K datapoints. The qualitative results, shown in Figure 2 and further expanded on in Appendix B show that the learned model is able to quickly adapt with only 5 datapoints, shown as purple triangles, whereas the model that is pretrained using standard supervised learning on all tasks is unable to adequately adapt with so few datapoints without catastrophic overfitting. Crucially, when the K datapoints are all in one half of the input range, the model trained with MAML can still infer the amplitude and phase in the other half of the range, demonstrating that the MAML trained model f has learned to model the periodic nature of the sine wave. Furthermore, we observe both in the qualitative and quantitative results (Figure 3 and Appendix B) that the model learned with MAML continues to improve with additional gradient steps, despite being trained for maximal performance after one gradient step. This improvement suggests that MAML optimizes the parameters such that they lie in a region that is amenable to fast adaptation and is sensitive to loss functions from p(\mathcal{T}), as discussed in Section 2.2, rather than overfitting to parameters \theta that only improve after one step.","As written in the paper, the authors claim that the meta-learned model f can learn the periodicity of a sine wave without looking at the entire dataset.","Yes.

1279,Is it true that the first-order approximation led to roughly 33% speed-up in network computation?,"A significant computational expense in MAML comes from the use of second derivatives when backpropagating the meta-gradient through the gradient operator in the meta-objective (see Equation (1)). On MiniImagenet, we show a comparison to a first-order approximation of MAML, where these second derivatives are omitted. Note that the resulting method still computes the meta-gradient at the post-update parameter values \theta_{i}^{\prime}, which provides for effective meta-learning. Surprisingly however, the performance of this method is nearly the same as that obtained with full second derivatives, suggesting that most of the improvement in MAML comes from the gradients of the objective at the post-update parameter values, rather than the second order updates from differentiating through the gradient update. Past work has observed that ReLU neural networks are locally almost linear (Goodfellow et al., 2015), which suggests that second derivatives may be close to zero in most cases, partially explaining the good performance of the first-order approximation. This approximation removes the need for computing Hessian-vector products in an additional backward pass, which we found led to roughly 33\% speed-up in network computation.","According to the paper, eliminating the Hessian calculation increases the overall calculation speed by 33%.","The SSD framework achieves high accuracy even with low resolution input images, improving the speed vs accuracy trade-off",0.1379310296313913,0.0,0.1379310296313913,2.673773914184628,21.291581383598302,17.984815692437568,0.1104972375690607,0.0104772991850989,0.2692451179027557,0.5301258373904874,0.2692450582981109,0.5717456340789795,0.0030775078797652,0.3333333333333333,0.7517110742744965,0.7952230012552473
1280,Why are there tradeoffs between sample variety and fidelity?,"This technique allows fine-grained, post-hoc selection of the trade-off between sample quality and variety for a given G. Notably, we can compute FID and IS for a range of thresholds, obtaining the variety-fidelity curve reminiscent of the precision-recall curve (Figure 17). As IS does not penalize lack of variety in class-conditional models, reducing the truncation threshold leads to a direct increase in IS (analogous to precision). FID penalizes lack of variety (analogous to recall) but also rewards precision, so we initially see a moderate improvement in FID, but as truncation approaches zero and variety diminishes, the FID sharply drops. The distribution shift caused by sampling with different latents than those seen in training is problematic for many models. Some of our larger models are not amenable to truncation, producing saturation artifacts (Figure 2(b)) when fed truncated noise. To counteract this, we seek to enforce amenability to truncation by conditioning G to be smooth, so that the full space of z will map to good output samples. For this, we turn to Orthogonal Regularization (Brock et al., 2017), which directly enforces the orthogonality condition: We evaluate our models on ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 (Russakovsky et al., 2015) at 128\times128, 256\times256, and 512\times512 resolutions, employing the settings from Table 1, row 8.The samples generated by our models are presented in Figure 4, with additional samples in Appendix A, and online222https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lWC6XEPD0LT5KUnPXeve_kWeY-FxH002.We report IS and FID in Table 2. As our models are able to trade sample variety for quality, it is unclear how best to compare against prior art; we accordingly report values at three settings, with complete curves in Appendix D. First, we report the FID/IS values at the truncation setting which attains the best FID. Second, we report the FID at the truncation setting for which our model’s IS is the same as that attained by the real validation data, reasoning that this is a passable measure of maximum sample variety achieved while still achieving a good level of “objectness.” Third, we report FID at the maximum IS achieved by each model, to demonstrate how much variety must be traded off to maximize quality. In all three cases, our models outperform the previous state-of-the-art IS and FID scores achieved by Miyato et al. (2018) and Zhang et al. (2018).","The tradeoff is as IS does not penalize lack of variety in class-conditional models, reducing the truncation threshold leads to a direct increase in IS (analogous to precision).

1284,How could we check whether D is overfitting the training set?,"We also observe that D’s loss approaches zero during training, but undergoes a sharp upward jump at collapse (Appendix F).One possible explanation for this behavior is that D is overfitting to the training set, memorizing training examples rather than learning some meaningful boundary between real and generated images. As a simple test for D’s memorization (related to Gulrajani et al. (2017)), we evaluate uncollapsed discriminators on the ImageNet training and validation sets, and measure what percentage of samples are classified as real or generated. While the training accuracy is consistently above 98%, the validation accuracy falls in the range of 50-55%, no better than random guessing (regardless of regularization strategy). This confirms that Dis indeed memorizing the training set;we deem this in line with D’s role, which is not explicitly to generalize, but to distill the training data and provide a useful learning signal for G.

1285,What if we train this model with small dataset?,"We note that some failure modes of our partially-trained models are distinct from those previously observed. Most previous failures involve local artifacts (Odena et al., 2016), images consisting of texture blobs instead of objects (Salimans et al., 2016), or the canonical mode collapse. We observe class leakage, where images from one class contain properties of another, as exemplified by Figure 4(d). We also find that many classes on ImageNet are more difficult than others for our model; our model is more successful at generating dogs (which make up a large portion of the dataset, and are mostly distinguished by their texture) than crowds (which comprise a small portion of the dataset and have more large-scale structure).

1286,What's the effect of expanding channel size?,"To confirm that our design choices are effective for even larger and more complex and diverse datasets, we also present results of our system on a subset of JFT-300M (Sun et al., 2017).The full JFT-300M dataset contains 300M real-world images labeled with 18K categories.Since the category distribution is heavily long-tailed, we subsample the dataset to keep only images with the 8.5K most common labels.The resulting dataset contains 292M images – two orders of magnitude larger than ImageNet. For images with multiple labels, we sample a single label randomly and independently whenever an image is sampled.To compute IS and FID for the GANs trained on this dataset, we use an Inception v2 classifier (Szegedy et al., 2016) trained on this dataset.Quantitative results are presented in Table 3.All models are trained with batch size 2048.We compare an ablated version of our model –comparable to SA-GAN (Zhang et al., 2018) but with the larger batch size –against a “full” BigGAN model that makes uses of all of the techniques applied to obtain the best results on ImageNet (shared embedding, skip-z, and orthogonal regularization).Our results show that these techniques substantially improve performance even in the setting of this much larger dataset at the same model capacity (64 base channels).We further show that for a dataset of this scale, we see significant additional improvements from expanding the capacity of our models to 128 base channels, while for ImageNet GANs that additional capacity was not beneficial.",expanding channel size substantially improves the performance of the model.,No,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3783783783783785,2.2522522522522523,0.0,0.0009990009990009,0.0204696133732795,0.0283658895641565,0.0204697027802467,,0.0004166239149067,,0.7506189953872333,0.728249019365459

1288,How the architecture is chosen,"Substitute Architecture: This factor is not the mostlimiting as the adversary must at least have some partial knowledge of theoracle input (e.g., images, text) andexpected output (e.g., classification). The adversary can thus usean architecture adapted to the input-output relation. For instance, aconvolutional neural network is suitable for image classification. Furthermore,we show in Section 6 that the type, number, and size of layers usedin the substitute DNN have relatively littleimpact on the success of the attack. Adversaries can also consider performingan architecture exploration and train several substitute models beforeselecting the one yielding the highest attack success. Substitute DNN Training Algorithm: We now describe the five-step training procedure outlined in Algorithm 1:•Initial Collection (1): The adversary collects a very small set S_{0} of inputs representative of the input domain. For instance, if the targeted oracle O classifies handwritten digits, the adversary collects 10 images of each digit 0 through 9. We show in Section 5 that this set does not necessarily have to come from the distribution from which the targeted oracle was trained.•Architecture Selection (2): The adversary selects an architecture to be trained as the substitute F. Again, this can be done using high-level knowledge of the classification task performed by the oracle (e.g., convolutional networks are appropriate for vision)•Substitute Training: The adversary iteratively trains moreaccurate substitute DNNs F_{\rho} by repeating the following for ρ∈0..ρm⁢a⁢x\rho\in 0..\rho_{max}italic_ρ ∈ 0 . . italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_a italic_x end_POSTSUBSCRIPT:–Labeling (3): By querying for the labels \tilde{O}(\vec{x}) output by oracle O, the adversary labels each sample \vec{x}\in S_{\rho} in its initial substitute training set S_{\rho}.–Training (4): The adversary trains the architecture chosen at step (2) using substitute training set S_{\rho} in conjunction with classical training techniques.–Augmentation (5): The adversary applies our augmentation technique on the initial substitute training set S_{\rho} to produce a larger substitute training set S_{\rho+1} with more synthetic training points. This new training set better represents the model’s decision boundaries. The adversary repeats steps (3) and (4) with the augmented set S_{\rho+1}.Step (3) is repeated several times to increase the substitute DNN’s accuracy and the similarity of its decision boundaries with the oracle. We introduce the term substitute training epoch, indexed with \rho, to refer to each iteration performed. This leads to this formalization of the Jacobian-based Dataset Augmentation performed at step (5) of our substitute training algorithm to find more synthetic training points:S_{\rho+1}=\{\vec{x}+\lambda\cdot\operatorname{sgn}(J_{F}[\tilde{O}(\vec{x})]):\vec{x}\in S_{\rho}\}\cup S_{\rho}(4)where \lambda is a parameter of the augmentation: it defines the size of the step taken in the sensitive direction identified by the Jacobian matrix to augment the set S_{\rho} into S_{\rho+1}. Choosing an Architecture: We train substitute DNNs A and F to M (cf.Table 13) using 150 samples from the MNIST test set as the substitute training set. During eachof the 6 substitute training epochs, the DNN is trained for 5 epochsfrom scratch. Between epochs, synthetic data is added to the training set using Jacobian-baseddataset augmentations with step \lambda=0.1. The substitutearchitectures differ from the oracle’s by the type, number, and sizeof layers. In Table 1,we report the accuracy of each architecture after 2 and 6 substitute training epochs, as well as the adversarialsample transferability after 6 epochs. Adversarial samples are crafted using the Goodfellow algorithm with an inputvariation of \varepsilon=0.4 (which we justify later). The last column ofTable 1shows that the choice of architecture has a limitedimpact on adversarial sample transferability, and therefore on the attacksuccess. The most important transferability drop follows from removing allconvolutional layers. Changing the hidden layer activation function fromrectified linear to a sigmoid does not impact transferability significantly. Goodfellow’s algorithm: Recall from Equation 5 the perturbation computed in the Goodfellow attack.Its only parameter is the variation \varepsilon added inthe direction of the gradient sign. We use the same architecture set asbefore to quantify the impact of \varepsilon onadversarial sample transferability.In Figure 8, architecture A outperformsall others: it is a copy of the oracle’s and acts as a baseline. Otherarchitectures have asymptotic transferability rates ranging between 72.24\%and 80.21\%, confirming that the substitute architecture choice hasa limited impact on transferability. Increasing the value of \varepsilon above0.4 yields little improvement in transferability and should be avoidedto guarantee indistinguishability of adversarial samples to humans.","The adversary (attacking part) must at least have some partial knowledge of the input (e.g., images, text) and expected output (e.g., classification) in order to select the architecture of the attacking system. The adversary selects an appropriate architecture adapted to the input-output relation. For instance, if the task is image classification or machine visioon, a convolutional neural network is the best choice. The parameters of the system (Deep Neural Network), like training epochs, number of layers , nodes etc., have relatively little impact on the success of the attack, so they do not determine the architecture.","Sure!

1289,The accuracy is achieved by which ML Model used for training the substitute,"Substitute DNN Training: The adversary uses the initial substitute training sets and the oracle to trainsubsitute DNNs. Our substitute architecture A, a standard forimage classification, is describedin Table 13 (cf. appendix).The substitute DNN is trained on ourmachine for 6 substitute epochs.Duringeach of these 6 epochs, the model is trained for 10 epochsfrom scratch with a learning rate of 10^{-2} and momentum of 0.9. Betweensubstitute epochs, we perform a Jacobian-based dataset augmentation with a stepsize of \lambda=0.1 to generate additional synthetic training data, which we label using the MetaMind oracle. The accuracy of the two substitute DNNs is reported inFigure 4. It is computed with the MNISTtest set (minus the 150 samples used in the first initial substitute trainingset). The adversary does not have access to this full test set: wesolely use it to analyze our results. The two substituteDNNs respectively achieve a 81.20\% and 67.00\% accuracy on the MNIST test set after 6 substitute training epochs. These accuracies fallshort of current state-of-the-art accuracies on this task. However, the adversary has access to a limited number ofsamples (in this case 6,400=100\times 2^{6} instead of 50,000 forstate-of-the-art models). Furthermore, the adversarial goal is to craftadversarial samples misclassified by the oracle. Instead of learning asubstitute DNN with optimal accuracy, the adversary is interested inlearning a substitute capable of mimicking the oracle decisionboundaries. Whereas we previously trained all of our substitutes using DNNs only, we now useboth DNNs and LR as substitute models. The Jacobian-based dataset augmentationdescribed in the context of DNNs is easily adapted to logistic regression: thelater is analog to the softmax layer frequently used by the former whenoutputting probability vectors. We use 100 samples from the MNIST test set asthe initial substitute training set and use the two refinements introduced inSection 6: a periodic step size and reservoirsampling. Substitute Training: By augmenting an initial training set of 100 test set samples, wetrain a DNN and LR substitute for each of the two oracles. We measure success as the rate of adversarialsamples misclassified by the corresponding oracle, among the 10,000 produced from the test set using the fast gradient sign method with parameter \varepsilon=0.3. These rates, computed after \rho\in\{3,6\} dataset augmentation iterations, are reported in Table 3. Results reported in the last row use both a periodic step size and reservoir sampling (hence the reduced number of queries made to train the substitute).","The ML model used for achieving the accuracy is a DNN (Deep Neural Network) combined with LR (Logistic Regression), and the two refinements as introduced in Section 6: a periodic step size and reservoir sampling.","Sure!

1290,What is the criteria for training multiple substitute DNNs?,"Substitute DNN Training Algorithm: We now describe the five-step training procedure outlined in Algorithm 1:•Initial Collection (1): The adversary collects a very small set S_{0} of inputs representative of the input domain. For instance, if the targeted oracle O classifies handwritten digits, the adversary collects 10 images of each digit 0 through 9. We show in Section 5 that this set does not necessarily have to come from the distribution from which the targeted oracle was trained.•Architecture Selection (2): The adversary selects an architecture to be trained as the substitute F. Again, this can be done using high-level knowledge of the classification task performed by the oracle (e.g., convolutional networks are appropriate for vision)•Substitute Training: The adversary iteratively trains moreaccurate substitute DNNs F_{\rho} by repeating the following for ρ∈0..ρm⁢a⁢x\rho\in 0..\rho_{max}italic_ρ ∈ 0 . . italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_a italic_x end_POSTSUBSCRIPT:–Labeling (3): By querying for the labels \tilde{O}(\vec{x}) output by oracle O, the adversary labels each sample \vec{x}\in S_{\rho} in its initial substitute training set S_{\rho}.–Training (4): The adversary trains the architecture chosen at step (2) using substitute training set S_{\rho} in conjunction with classical training techniques.–Augmentation (5): The adversary applies our augmentation technique on the initial substitute training set S_{\rho} to produce a larger substitute training set S_{\rho+1} with more synthetic training points. This new training set better represents the model’s decision boundaries. The adversary repeats steps (3) and (4) with the augmented set S_{\rho+1}.Step (3) is repeated several times to increase the substitute DNN’s accuracy and the similarity of its decision boundaries with the oracle. We introduce the term substitute training epoch, indexed with \rho, to refer to each iteration performed. This leads to this formalization of the Jacobian-based Dataset Augmentation performed at step (5) of our substitute training algorithm to find more synthetic training points:S_{\rho+1}=\{\vec{x}+\lambda\cdot\operatorname{sgn}(J_{F}[\tilde{O}(\vec{x})]):\vec{x}\in S_{\rho}\}\cup S_{\rho}(4)where \lambda is a parameter of the augmentation: it defines the size of the step taken in the sensitive direction identified by the Jacobian matrix to augment the set S_{\rho} into S_{\rho+1}. The accuracy of the two substitute DNNs is reported inFigure 4. It is computed with the MNISTtest set (minus the 150 samples used in the first initial substitute trainingset). The adversary does not have access to this full test set: wesolely use it to analyze our results. The two substituteDNNs respectively achieve a 81.20\% and 67.00\% accuracy on the MNIST test set after 6 substitute training epochs. These accuracies fallshort of current state-of-the-art accuracies on this task. However, the adversary has access to a limited number ofsamples (in this case 6,400=100\times 2^{6} instead of 50,000 forstate-of-the-art models). Furthermore, the adversarial goal is to craftadversarial samples misclassified by the oracle. Instead of learning asubstitute DNN with optimal accuracy, the adversary is interested inlearning a substitute capable of mimicking the oracle decisionboundaries. Substitute DNN Training: The adversary uses twoinitial substitute training sets extracted from the GTSRB test set. Thefirst includes the first 1,000 samples and the second thefirst 500. The number of initial samples is higher than forMNIST substitutes as inputs have a higher dimensionality. We trainthree substitute architectures C, D, and E (cf.Table 13) using the oracle for 6 substitutetraining epochs with a Jacobian-based dataset augmentation parameter of\lambda=0.1. Substitute C and E where trained with the 1,000 sampleinitial substitute training set and achieve a 71.42\% accuracy. Substitute Dwas trained with the initial set of 500 samples. Its accuracy of 60.12\% islower than C and E. Choosing an Architecture: We train substitute DNNs A and F to M (cf.Table 13) using 150 samples from the MNIST test set as the substitute training set. During eachof the 6 substitute training epochs, the DNN is trained for 5 epochsfrom scratch. Between epochs, synthetic data is added to the training set using Jacobian-baseddataset augmentations with step \lambda=0.1. The substitutearchitectures differ from the oracle’s by the type, number, and sizeof layers. In Table 1,we report the accuracy of each architecture after 2 and 6 substitute training epochs, as well as the adversarialsample transferability after 6 epochs. Adversarial samples are crafted using the Goodfellow algorithm with an inputvariation of \varepsilon=0.4 (which we justify later). The last column ofTable 1shows that the choice of architecture has a limitedimpact on adversarial sample transferability, and therefore on the attacksuccess. The most important transferability drop follows from removing allconvolutional layers. Changing the hidden layer activation function fromrectified linear to a sigmoid does not impact transferability significantly.",The criteria for training multiple substitute DNNs is achieve good accuray but mainly  the goal is to create a substitute capable of mimicking the oracle decision boundaries.,"No, YOLO9000 and YOLOv2 are not the same thing. YOLOv2 is an improved version of the base YOLO detection system, while YOLO9000 is a real-time object detector that can detect over 9000 different object categories using a combination of data from ImageNet and COCO.

1291,What type of defense strategies are evaded in this paper ,"We show a more general flaw in the category of gradient masking.Even if the defender attempts to prevent attacks by not publishingthe directions in which the model is sensitive, these directionscan be discovered by other means, in which case thesame attack can still succeed.We show that the black-box attack based on transfer from a substitute modelovercomes gradient masking defenses. No fully effective defense mechanism is known, but we study the two with thegreatest empirical success so far:adversarial training [4, 14], anddefensive distillation for DNNs [10]. Adversarial training:It was shown that injecting adversarial examples throughout training increasesthe robustness of significantly descriptive models, such as DNNs [4, 14, 17].We implemented an approximation of this defense using the Google Prediction API.Since the API does not support the generation of adversarial examplesat every step of training, as a correct implementation of adversarial training woulddo, we instead inject a large amount of adversarial examples infrequently.After training in this way, the model has a misclassification rate of 8.75\% onthe unperturbed test set,but the adversarial misclassification rate rises to 100\% when \rho=6.To evaluate this defense strategy using a correct implementation, we resortto training the oracle locally, using our own codebase that includes support forgenerating adversarial examples at each step.After each training batch, we compute and train on adversarial examplesgenerated with the fast gradient sign method before starting training on the next batch of theoriginal training data.Results are given in Table 4.We observe that for \varepsilon=0.15, the defense can be evaded using theblack-box attack with adversarial examples crafted on the substitute andmisclassified by the oracle at rates up to 71.25\%.However, for \varepsilon=0.3, the black-box attack is not effective anymore.Therefore, making a machine learning model robust to small and infinitesimalperturbations of its inputs is an example of gradient masking and canbe evaded using our substitute-based black-box approach.However, making the model robust to larger and finite perturbations preventsthe black-box attack.To confirm this hypothesis, we now show that defensive distillation, whichmakes the model robust to infinitesimal perturbations, can be evaded by theblack-box approach. Defensive distillation:Due to space constraints, we refer readers to [10] fora detailed presentation of defensivedistillation, which is an alternative defense.Because the remotely hosted APIs we study here do not implement defensive distillation or provideprimitives that could be used to implement it,we are forced to evaluate this defense on a locally trained oracle.Therefore, we train a distilled model as described in [10] to act as our MNIST oracle.","Two types of defense are evaded, Adversarial training and Defensive distillation.","80% of the selected tokens are changed to [MASK], or 12% of all tokens in the input sequence (80% of 15% is 12%)",0.133333328688889,0.0,0.133333328688889,0.8728922598851214,14.772108770171688,12.58696816857186,0.1,0.0103463787674313,0.1140777617692947,0.2155976927196475,0.1140776947140693,0.1665033102035522,0.0069748026851686,0.0,0.7373157739607611,0.7018879639604896

1294,How does YOLO9000 achieve the feat of predicting detections for classes despite not having labelled data for them?,"Using this joint training, YOLO9000 learns to find objects in images using the detection data in COCO and it learns to classify a wide variety of these objects using data from ImageNet. We evaluate YOLO9000 on the ImageNet detection task. The detection task for ImageNet shares on 44 object categories with COCO which means that YOLO9000 has only seen classification data for the majority of the test images, not detection data. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP overall with 16.0 mAP on the disjoint 156 object classes that it has never seen any labelled detection data for. This mAP is higher than results achieved by DPM but YOLO9000 is trained on different datasets with only partial supervision [4]. It also is simultaneously detecting 9000 other object categories, all in real-time. When we analyze YOLO9000’s performance on ImageNet we see it learns new species of animals well but struggles with learning categories like clothing and equipment. New animals are easier to learn because the objectness predictions generalize well from the animals in COCO. Conversely, COCO does not have bounding box label for any type of clothing, only for person, so YOLO9000 struggles to model categories like “sunglasses” or “swimming trunks”. YOLO9000 is a real-time framework for detection more than 9000 object categories by jointly optimizing detection and classification.

1295,What differences exist in the labeling procedure for classification datasets/detection datasets for there to be such a large difference in scale?,"Current object detection datasets are limited compared to datasets for other tasks like classification and tagging. The most common detection datasets contain thousands to hundreds of thousands of images with dozens to hundreds of tags [3] [10] [2]. Classification datasets have millions of images with tens or hundreds of thousands of categories [20] [2]. We would like detection to scale to level of object classification. However, labelling images for detection is far more expensive than labelling for classification or tagging (tags are often user-supplied for free). Thus we are unlikely to see detection datasets on the same scale as classification datasets in the near future. We propose a new method to harness the large amount of classification data we already have and use it to expand the scope of current detection systems. Our method uses a hierarchical view of object classification that allows us to combine distinct datasets together. This approach presents a few challenges. Detection datasets have only common objects and general labels, like “dog” or “boat”. Classification datasets have a much wider and deeper range of labels. ImageNet has more than a hundred breeds of dog, including “Norfolk terrier”, “Yorkshire terrier”, and “Bedlington terrier”. If we want to train on both datasets we need a coherent way to merge these labels.",The reason between different scale of availability between classification and detection datasets is due to the  fact that labelling images for detection is far more expensive than labelling for classification or tagging. For example common object detection datasets contain only 10 to 100 thousands images with dozen to hundred tags whereas image classification datasets  have million of images with thousands of classes. Object detection methods like YOLO can utilize the large amount of classification data to help the detection task.,"Yes. The use of auto-regression in the decoder, which consumes previously generated symbols as additional input, is a form of attention that allows the model to capture long-term dependencies in the input sequence.

However, what we really want are priors that lead to good IOU scores, which is independent of the size of the box. Thus for our distance metric we use: We run k-means for various values of k and plot the average IOU with closest centroid, see Figure 2. We choose k=5 as a good tradeoff between model complexity and high recall. The cluster centroids are significantly different than hand-picked anchor boxes. There are fewer short, wide boxes and more tall, thin boxes. We compare the average IOU to closest prior of our clustering strategy and the hand-picked anchor boxes in Table 1. At only 5 priors the centroids perform similarly to 9 anchor boxes with an average IOU of 61.0 compared to 60.9. If we use 9 centroids we see a much higher average IOU. This indicates that using k-means to generate our bounding box starts the model off with a better representation and makes the task easier to learn.",A graph is shown between average IOU vs. number of clusters.

1305,"What does ""synset"" mean? ","WordNet is structured as a directed graph, not a tree, because language is complex. For example a “dog” is both a type of “canine” and a type of “domestic animal” which are both synsets in WordNet. Instead of using the full graph structure, we simplify the problem by building a hierarchical tree from the concepts in ImageNet. To build this tree we examine the visual nouns in ImageNet and look at their paths through the WordNet graph to the root node, in this case “physical object”. Many synsets only have one path through the graph so first we add all of those paths to our tree. Then we iteratively examine the concepts we have left and add the paths that grow the tree by as little as possible. So if a concept has two paths to the root and one path would add three edges to our tree and the other would only add one edge, we choose the shorter path.",SynSets are part of WordNet structured directed graph that represent similar concepts such as canine and domestic animals both can represent a dog.

1306,Are the softmax values of different sets of co-hyponyms compared?,"Most approaches to classification use a softmax layer across all the possible categories to compute the final probability distribution. Using a softmax assumes the classes are mutually exclusive. This presents problems for combining datasets, for example you would not want to combine ImageNet and COCO using this model because the classes “Norfolk terrier” and “dog” are not mutually exclusive. The final result is WordTree, a hierarchical model of visual concepts. To perform classification with WordTree we predict conditional probabilities at every node for the probability of each hyponym of that synset given that synset. For example, at the “terrier” node we predict: To validate this approach we train the Darknet-19 model on WordTree built using the 1000 class ImageNet. To build WordTree1k we add in all of the intermediate nodes which expands the label space from 1000 to 1369. During training we propagate ground truth labels up the tree so that if an image is labelled as a “Norfolk terrier” it also gets labelled as a “dog” and a “mammal”, etc. To compute the conditional probabilities our model predicts a vector of 1369 values and we compute the softmax over all sysnsets that are hyponyms of the same concept, see Figure 5.",Classification approaches use a softmax layer across all categories to predict the final probability of all classes. This technique would fail for models which combine datasets having similar classes. To overcome the proposed model also use a softmax over all sysnsets that are co-hyponyms.

1311,What does it mean for view synthesis to be the supervisory signal?,"The key supervision signal for our depth and pose prediction CNNs comes from the task of novel view synthesis: given one input view of a scene, synthesize a new image of the scene seen from a different camera pose. We can synthesize a target view given a per-pixel depth in that image, plus the pose and visibility in a nearby view. As we will show next, this synthesis process can be implemented in a fully differentiable manner with CNNs as the geometry and pose estimation modules. Visibility can be handled, along with non-rigidity and other non-modeled factors, using an “explanability” mask, which we discuss later (Sec. 3.3). Note that the idea of view synthesis as supervision has also been recently explored for learning single-view depth estimation [14, 16] and multi-view stereo [10]. However, to the best of our knowledge, all previous work requires posed image sets during training (and testing too in the case of DeepStereo), while our framework can be applied to standard videos without pose information. Furthermore, it predicts the poses as part of the learning framework. See Figure 2 for an illustration of our learning pipeline for depth and pose estimation.","From view synthesis as the supervisory signal it means that proposed depth and pose prediction CNN require multiple new images of the scene from different poses given an input view.

1312,What are the metrics used for monocular depth and camera motion estimation?,"To the best of our knowledge, no previous systems exist that learn single-view depth estimation in an unsupervised manner from monocular videos. Nonetheless, here we provide comparison with prior methods with depth supervision [7] and recent methods that use calibrated stereo images (i.e. with pose supervision) for training [14, 16].Since the depth predicted by our method is defined up to a scale factor, for evaluation we multiply the predicted depth maps by a scalar \hat{s} that matches the median with the ground-truth, i.e. \hat{s}=median(D_{gt})/median(D_{pred}). To evaluate the performance of our pose estimation network, we applied our system to the official KITTI odometry split (containing 11 driving sequences with ground truth odometry obtained through the IMU/GPS readings, which we use for evaluation purpose only), and used sequences 00-08 for training and 09-10 for testing. In this experiment, we fix the length of input image sequences to our system to 5 frames. We compare our ego-motion estimation with two variants of monocular ORB-SLAM [37] (a well-established SLAM system): 1) ORB-SLAM (full), which recovers odometry using all frames of the driving sequence (i.e. allowing loop closure and re-localization), and 2) ORB-SLAM (short), which runs on 5-frame snippets (same as our input setting). Another baseline we compare with is the dataset mean of car motion (using ground-truth odometry) for 5-frame snippets. To resolve scale ambiguity during evaluation, we first optimize the scaling factor for the predictions made by each method to best align with the ground truth, and then measure the Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) [37] as the metric. ATE is computed on 5-frame snippets and averaged over the full sequence.333For evaluating ORB-SLAM (full) we break down the trajectory of the full sequence into 5-frame snippets with the reference coordinate frame adjusted to the central frame of each snippet. As shown in Table 3 and Fig. 9, our method outperforms both baselines (mean odometry and ORB-SLAM (short)) that share the same input setting as ours, but falls short of ORB-SLAM (full), which leverages whole sequences (1591 for seq. 09 and 1201 for seq. 10) for loop closure and re-localization.",Depth map are computed and matched across different scales for monocular depth metric.

1322,What does it mean for a surface to be Lambertian?,"Note that when applied to monocular videos the above view synthesis formulation implicitly assumes 1) the scene is static without moving objects; 2) there is no occlusion/disocclusion between the target view and the source views; 3) the surface is Lambertian so that the photo-consistency error is meaningful. If any of these assumptions are violated in a training sequence, the gradients could be corrupted and potentially inhibit training. To improve the robustness of our learning pipeline to these factors, we additionally train a explainability prediction network (jointly and simultaneously with the depth and pose networks) that outputs a per-pixel soft mask \hat{E}_{s} for each target-source pair, indicating the network’s belief in where direct view synthesis will be successfully modeled for each target pixel. Based on the predicted \hat{E}_{s}, the view synthesis objective is weighted correspondingly by\mathcal{L}_{vs}=\sum_{<I_{1},\ldots,I_{N}>\in\mathcal{S}}\sum_{p}\hat{E}_{s}(p)|I_{t}(p)-\hat{I}_{s}(p)|~{}.(3)Since we do not have direct supervision for \hat{E}_{s}, training with the above loss would result in a trivial solution of the network always predicting \hat{E}_{s} to be zero, which perfectly minimizes the loss. To resolve this, we add a regularization term \mathcal{L}_{reg}(\hat{E}_{s}) that encourages nonzero predictions by minimizing the cross-entropy loss with constant label 1 at each pixel location. In other words, the network is encouraged to minimize the view synthesis objective, but allowed a certain amount of slack for discounting the factors not considered by the model.",Lambertian surface can show the meaningful photo-consistency error.,"Yes.

1326,"Why does ORB-SLAM (short) perform so poorly when the turning magnitude is low, as seen in Figure 9?","In this work, we mimic this approach by training a model that observes sequences of images and aims to explain its observations by predicting likely camera motion and the scene structure (as shown in Fig. 1). We take an end-to-end approach in allowing the model to map directly from input pixels to an estimate of ego-motion (parameterized as 6-DoF transformation matrices) and the underlying scene structure (parameterized as per-pixel depth maps under a reference view). We are particularly inspired by prior work that has suggested view synthesis as a metric [44] and recent work that tackles the calibrated, multi-view 3D case in an end-to-end framework [10]. Our method is unsupervised, and can be trained simply using sequences of images with no manual labeling or even camera motion information. For better understanding of our pose estimation results, we show in Figure 9 the ATE curve with varying amount of side-rotation by the car between the beginning and the end of a sequence. Figure 9 suggests that our method is significantly better than ORB-SLAM (short) when the side-rotation is small (i.e. car mostly driving forward), and comparable to ORB-SLAM (full) across the entire spectrum.

1327,How did the authors come to the conclusion that the pose network likely uses image correspondence and the depth estimation network likely recognizes common structural features?,"The key supervision signal for our depth and pose prediction CNNs comes from the task of novel view synthesis: given one input view of a scene, synthesize a new image of the scene seen from a different camera pose. We can synthesize a target view given a per-pixel depth in that image, plus the pose and visibility in a nearby view. As we will show next, this synthesis process can be implemented in a fully differentiable manner with CNNs as the geometry and pose estimation modules. Visibility can be handled, along with non-rigidity and other non-modeled factors, using an “explanability” mask, which we discuss later (Sec. 3.3). Another interesting area for future work would be to investigate in more detail the representation learned by our system. In particular, the pose network likely uses some form of image correspondence in estimating the camera motion, whereas the depth estimation network likely recognizes common structural features of scenes and objects. It would be interesting to probe these, and investigate the extent to which our network already performs, or could be re-purposed to perform, tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation.","New scenes can be synthesized given camera poses which will require image correspondence. Whereas  we can also synthesize a target view given a per-pixel depth in that image, plus the pose and visibility in a nearby view including structural features.","YOLO suffers from shortcomings due to localization errors and low recall compared to region proposal-based methods, as mentioned by the authors",0.0740740694101512,0.0,0.0370370323731144,1.121617874316939,18.42557381564441,15.25504969356456,0.0488997555012225,0.0053557765876052,0.1937893480062484,0.4048678363212433,0.2067010104656219,0.4046733975410461,0.0040448950168438,0.6666666666666666,0.7810449145977651,0.7435377331551674
1328,How do the authors come to the conclusion that the thinness is what is causing regions to be masked improperly? ,"The simultaneous estimation of structure and motion is a well studied problem with an established toolchain of techniques [12, 50, 38]. Whilst the traditional toolchain is effective and efficient in many cases, its reliance on accurate image correspondence can cause problems in areas of low texture, complex geometry/photometry, thin structures, and occlusions. To address these issues, several of the pipeline stages have been recently tackled using deep learning, e.g., feature matching [18], pose estimation [26], and stereo [10, 27, 53]. These learning-based techniques are attractive in that they are able to leverage external supervision during training, and potentially overcome the above issues when applied to test data.",The simultaneous estimation of structure and motion is a well studied problem where traditional methods suffer from thin structures.

1330,How are loops detected and validated?,"Loop closing is performed in two steps, firstly a loop has to be detected and validated, and secondly the loop is corrected optimizing a pose-graph.In contrast to monocular ORB-SLAM, where scale drift may occur [20], the stereo/depth information makes scale observable and the geometric validation andpose-graph optimization no longer require dealing with scale drift and are based on rigid body transformations instead of similarities. In ORB-SLAM2 we have incorporated a full BA optimization after the pose-graph to achieve the optimal solution. This optimization might be very costly and therefore weperform it in a separate thread, allowing the system to continue creating map and detecting loops. However this brings the challenge of merging the bundle adjustmentoutput with the current state of the map. If a new loop is detected while the optimization is running, we abort the optimizationand proceed to close the loop, which will launch the full BA optimization again. When the full BA finishes,we need to merge the updated subset of keyframes and points optimized by the full BA, with the non-updated keyframes and pointsthat where inserted while the optimization was running. This is done by propagating the correction of updated keyframes (i.e. the transformation from the non-optimized to the optimized pose)to non-updated keyframes through the spanning tree. Non-updated points are transformed according to the correction applied to their reference keyframe.",In ORB-SLAM2 a full BA optimization is used for loop detection and validation.

In this mode the local mapping and loop closing threads are deactivatedand the camera is continuously localized by the tracking using relocalization if needed. In this mode the tracking leverages visual odometry matches and matches to map points.Visual odometry matches are matches between ORB in the current frame and 3D points created in the previous frame from the stereo/depth information.

1333,Why are pure rotations hard to track for monocular SLAM?,"Visual SLAM can be performed by using just a monocular camera, which is the cheapest and smallest sensor setup.However as depth is not observable from just one camera, the scale of the map andestimated trajectory is unknown. In addition the system bootstrapping require multi-view or filtering techniques to produce an initial map as it cannot be triangulated from the veryfirst frame. Last but not least, monocular SLAM suffers from scale drift and may fail if performing pure rotations in exploration.

The system has three main parallel threads: 1) the tracking to localize the camera with every frame by findingfeature matches to the local map and minimizing the reprojection error applying motion-only BA, 2) the local mapping to manage the local map and optimize it, performing local BA,3) the loop closing to detect large loops and correct the accumulated drift by performing a pose-graph optimization. This thread launches a fourth thread to perform full BA afterthe pose-graph optimization, to compute the optimal structure and motion solution.

The inputimages are then discarded and all system operationsare based on these features, so that the system is independent of the sensor being stereo or RGB-D.Our system handles monocular and stereo keypoints, which are further classified as close or far. Stereo keypoints are defined by three coordinates \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{s}}=\left(u_{L},v_{L},u_{R}\right), being (u_{L},v_{L}) the coordinates on the left image and u_{R} the horizontalcoordinate in the right image. For stereo cameras, we extract ORB in both images and for every left ORB we search for a match in the right image. This can be done very efficiently assumingstereo rectified images, so that epipolar lines are horizontal.

We discuss the details of our hardware setup in Section 5.1, and discuss the data collection process in Section 5.2. To ensure generalization of the learned prediction network, the specific parameters of each robot varied in terms of the camera pose relative to the robot, providing independence to camera calibration. Furthermore, uneven wear and tear on each robot resulted in differences in the shape of the gripper fingers. Although accurately predicting optimal motion vectors in open-loop is not possible with this degree of variation, as demonstrated in our experiments, our continuous servoing method can correct mistakes by observing the outcomes of its past actions, achieving a high success rate even without knowledge of the precise camera calibration. Our robotic manipulator platform consists of a lightweight 7 degree of freedom arm, a compliant, underactuated, two-finger gripper, and a camera mounted behind the arm looking over the shoulder. An illustration of a single robot is shown in Figure 5. The underactuated gripper provides some degree of compliance for oddly shaped objects, at the cost of producing a loose grip that is prone to slipping. An interesting property of this gripper was uneven wear and tear over the course of data collection, which lasted several months. Images of the grippers of various robots are shown in Figure 7, illustrating the range of variation in gripper wear and geometry. Furthermore, the cameras were mounted at slightly varying angles, providing a different viewpoint for each robot. The views from the cameras of all 14 robots during data collection are shown in Figure 6.","The differences in hardware include different gripper shapes, illustrating the range of variation in gripper wear and geometry as in Figure 7.

1341,How does the network achieve the correction of its own mistakes?,"In order to train our prediction network, we collected over 800,000 grasp attempts using a set of similar (but not identical) robotic manipulators, shown in Figure 1. We discuss the details of our hardware setup in Section 5.1, and discuss the data collection process in Section 5.2. To ensure generalization of the learned prediction network, the specific parameters of each robot varied in terms of the camera pose relative to the robot, providing independence to camera calibration. Furthermore, uneven wear and tear on each robot resulted in differences in the shape of the gripper fingers. Although accurately predicting optimal motion vectors in open-loop is not possible with this degree of variation, as demonstrated in our experiments, our continuous servoing method can correct mistakes by observing the outcomes of its past actions, achieving a high success rate even without knowledge of the precise camera calibration. Our method consists of two components: a grasp success predictor, which uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to determine how likely a given motion is to produce a successful grasp, and a continuous servoing mechanism that uses the CNN to continuously update the robot’s motor commands. By continuously choosing the best predicted path to a successful grasp, the servoing mechanism provides the robot with fast feedback to perturbations and object motion, as well as robustness to inaccurate actuation. We presented a method for learning hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping, using deep learning to build a grasp success prediction network, and a continuous servoing mechanism to use this network to continuously control a robotic manipulator. By training on over 800,000 grasp attempts from 14 distinct robotic manipulators with variation in camera pose, we can achieve invariance to camera calibration and small variations in the hardware. Unlike most grasping and visual servoing methods, our approach does not require calibration of the camera to the robot, instead using continuous feedback to correct any errors resulting from discrepancies in calibration. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively grasp a wide range of different objects, including novel objects not seen during training. Our results also show that our method can use continuous feedback to correct mistakes and reposition the gripper in response to perturbation and movement of objects in the scene.","The network achieves the correction of its own mistakes using the continuous servoing method can correct mistakes by observing the outcomes of its past actions, achieving a high success rate.

1342,What does it mean for perception or feedback to be open loop?,"The goal of our evaluation was to answer the following questions: (1) does continuous servoing significantly improve grasping accuracy and success rate? (2) how well does our learning-based system perform when compared to alternative approaches? To answer question (1), we compared our approach to an open-loop method that observes the scene prior to the grasp, extracts image patches, chooses the patch with the highest probability of a successful grasp, and then uses a known camera calibration to move the gripper to that location. This method is analogous to the approach proposed by Pinto & Gupta (2015), but uses the same network architecture as our method and the same training set. We refer to this approach as “open loop,” since it does not make use of continuous visual feedback.

The main contributions of this work are a method for learning continuous visual servoing for robotic grasping from monocular cameras, a novel convolutional neural network architecture for learning to predict the outcome of a grasp attempt, and a large-scale data collection framework for robotic grasps. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our convolutional neural network grasping controller achieves a high success rate when grasping in clutter on a wide range of objects, including objects that are large, small, hard, soft, deformable, and translucent. Supplemental videos of our grasping system show that the robot employs continuous feedback to constantly adjust its grasp, accounting for motion of the objects and inaccurate actuation commands. We also compare our approach to open-loop variants to demonstrate the importance of continuous feedback, as well as a hand-engineering grasping baseline that uses manual hand-to-eye calibration and depth sensing. Our method achieves the highest success rates in our experiments. Our dataset is available here: https://sites.google.com/site/brainrobotdata/home Data-driven methods take a variety of different forms, including human-supervised methods that predict grasp configurations (Herzog et al., 2014; Lenz et al., 2015) and methods that predict finger placement from geometric criteria computed offline (Goldfeder et al., 2009a). Both types of data-driven grasp selection have recently incorporated deep learning (Kappler et al., 2015; Lenz et al., 2015; Redmon & Angelova, 2015). Feedback has been incorporated into grasping primarily as a way to achieve the desired forces for force closure and other dynamic grasping criteria (Hudson et al., 2012), as well as in the form of standard servoing mechanisms, including visual servoing (described below) to servo the gripper to a pre-planned grasp pose (Kragic & Christensen, 2002). The method proposed in this work is entirely data-driven, and does not rely on any human annotation either at training or test time, in contrast to prior methods based on grasp points. Furthermore, our approach continuously adjusts the motor commands to maximize grasp success, providing continuous feedback. Comparatively little prior work has addressed direct visual feedback for grasping, most of which requires manually designed features to track the end effector (Vahrenkamp et al., 2008; Hebert et al., 2012). Our approach is most closely related to recent work on self-supervised learning of grasp poses by Pinto & Gupta (2015). This prior work proposed to learn a network to predict the optimal grasp orientation for a given image patch, trained with self-supervised data collected using a heuristic grasping system based on object proposals. In contrast to this prior work, our approach achieves continuous hand-eye coordination by observing the gripper and choosing the best motor command to move the gripper toward a successful grasp, rather than making open-loop predictions. Furthermore, our approach does not require proposals or crops of image patches and, most importantly, does not require calibration between the robot and the camera, since the closed-loop servoing mechanism can compensate for offsets due to differences in camera pose by continuously adjusting the motor commands. We trained our method using over 800,000 grasp attempts on a very large variety of objects, which is more than an order of magnitude larger than prior methods based on direct self-supervision (Pinto & Gupta, 2015) and more than double the dataset size of prior methods based on synthetic grasps from 3D scans (Kappler et al., 2015).

1344,How were the probability percentages chosen for the two heuristics of the continuous serving algorithm?,"We can use the predicted grasp success p(\ell=1) produced by the network to inform a heuristic for raising and lowering the gripper, as well as to choose when to stop moving and attempt a grasp. We use two heuristics in particular: first, we close the gripper whenever the network predicts that (\mathbf{I}_{t},\emptyset), where \emptyset corresponds to no motion, will succeed with a probability that is at least 90\% of the best inferred motion \mathbf{v}_{t}^{\star}. The rationale behind this is to stop the grasp early if closing the gripper is nearly as likely to produce a successful grasp as moving it. The second heuristic is to raise the gripper off the table when (\mathbf{I}_{t},\emptyset) has a probability of success that is less than 50\% of \mathbf{v}_{t}^{\star}. The rationale behind this choice is that, if closing the gripper now is substantially worse than moving it, the gripper is most likely not positioned in a good configuration, and a large motion will be required. Therefore, raising the gripper off the table minimizes the chance of hitting other objects that are in the way. While these heuristics are somewhat ad-hoc, we found that they were effective for successfully grasping a wide range of objects in highly cluttered situations, as discussed in Section 6. Pseudocode for the servoing mechanism f(\mathbf{I}_{t}) is presented in Algorithm 1. Further details on the servoing mechanism are presented in Appendix A.","We use two heuristics in particular: first, we close the gripper whenever the network predicts that (\mathbf{I}_{t},\emptyset), where \emptyset corresponds to no motion, will succeed with a probability that is at least 90\% of the best inferred motion \mathbf{v}_{t}^{\star}.

1345,Is the additional image I0 unchanged throughout the entire training process?,"The architecture of our grasp prediction CNN is shown in Figure 4. The network takes the current image \mathbf{I}_{t} as input, as well as an additional image \mathbf{I}_{0} that is recorded before the grasp begins, and does not contain the gripper. This additional image provides an unoccluded view of the scene. The two input images are concatenated and processed by 5 convolutional layers with batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), following by max pooling. After the 5^{\text{th}} layer, we provide the vector \mathbf{v}_{t} as input to the network. The vector is represented by 5 values: a 3D translation vector, and a sine-cosine encoding of the change in orientation of the gripper about the vertical axis.111In this work, we only consider vertical pinch grasps, though extensions to other grasp parameterizations would be straightforward. To provide this vector to the convolutional network, we pass it through one fully connected layer and replicate it over the spatial dimensions of the response map after layer 5, concatenating it with the output of the pooling layer. After this concatenation, further convolution and pooling operations are applied, as described in Figure 4, followed by a set of small fully connected layers that output the probability of grasp success, trained with a cross-entropy loss to match \ell_{i}, causing the network to output p(\ell_{i}=1). The input matches are 512\times 512 pixels, and we randomly crop the images to a 472\times 472 region during training to provide for translation invariance.","The additional image I0 is unchanged throughout the entire training process.

1346,How were the variations of the camera poses for the different robots determined? ,"The grasp prediction CNN was trained using a dataset of over 800,000 grasp attempts, collected using a cluster of similar (but not identical) robotic manipulators, shown in Figure 1, over the course of several months.Although the hardware parameters of each robot were initially identical, each unit experienced different wear and tear over the course of data collection, interacted with different objects, and used a slightly different camera pose relative to the robot base. These differences provided a diverse dataset for learning continuous hand-eye coordination for grasping. Another related area to our method is visual servoing, which addresses moving a camera or end-effector to a desired pose using visual feedback (Kragic & Christensen, 2002). In contrast to our approach, visual servoing methods are typically concerned with reaching a pose relative to objects in the scene, and often (though not always) rely on manually designed or specified features for feedback control (Espiau et al., 1992; Wilson et al., 1996; Vahrenkamp et al., 2008; Hebert et al., 2012; Mohta et al., 2014). Photometric visual servoing uses a target image rather than features (Caron et al., 2013), and several visual servoing methods have been proposed that do not directly require prior calibration between the robot and camera (Yoshimi & Allen, 1994; Jägersand et al., 1997; Kragic & Christensen, 2002). To the best of our knowledge, no prior learning-based method has been proposed that uses visual servoing to directly move into a pose that maximizes the probability of success on a given task (such as grasping).","A slightly different camera pose was selected for each robot, relative to the robot base.

In this work, we present a multimodal feature learning algorithm which adds a structured regularization penalty to the objective function to be optimized during learning.  ignore modality information at the first layer (i.e., encourage all features to use all modalities) or train separate first-layer features for each modality.","The authors transformed the gray-scale CT images into RGB channels to align with the input channels of pre-trained CNN models, and used different CT windowing channels to improve classification results, without relying on lung segmentation",0.1111111078125001,0.0,0.0972222189236112,0.3580529807530212,23.86286106787549,20.40489937242347,0.044776119402985,0.0022529771483746,0.266789823770523,0.5494699035369014,0.313866376876831,0.3769680559635162,0.0047145877000549,0.4,0.7980662315372221,0.8080835851904926

1361,What other differences between CEM and CMA-ES exist that might affect performance?,"Covariance Matrix Adaption Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) (Hansen & Ostermeier, 2001): Similar to CEM, CMA-ES is a gradient-free evolutionary approach for optimizing nonconvex objective functions. In our case, this objective function equals the average sampled return. In contrast to CEM, CMA-ES estimates the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution through incremental adaption along evolution paths, which contain information about the correlation between consecutive updates. Gradient-free methods: Surprisingly, even when training deep neural network policies with thousands of parameters, CEM achieves very good performance on certain basic tasks such as Cart-Pole Balancing and Mountain Car, suggesting that the dimension of the searching parameter is not always the limiting factor of the method. However, the performance degrades quickly as the system dynamics becomes more complicated. We also observe that CEM outperforms CMA-ES, which is remarkable as CMA-ES estimates the full covariance matrix. For higher-dimensional policy parameterizations, the computational complexity and memory requirement for CMA-ES become noticeable. On tasks with high-dimensional observations, such as the Full Humanoid, the CMA-ES algorithm runs out of memory and fails to yield any results, denoted as N/A in Table 1.","We also observe that CEM outperforms CMA-ES, which is remarkable as CMA-ES estimates the full covariance matrix.

What do they mean with other methods here?,"In the realm of diffusion models, inversion can be performed na¨ıvely by adding noise to an image and then de-noising it through the network. However, this process tends to change the image content significantly. Choi et al. (2021) improve inversion by conditioning the denoising process on noised low-pass filter data from the target image. (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021) demonstrate that the DDIM (Song et al., 2020) sampling process can be inverted in a closed-form manner, extracting a latent noise map that will produce a given real image. In DALL-E 2 (Ramesh et al., 2022), they build on this method and demonstrate that it can be used to induce changes in the image, such as cross-image interpolations or semantic editing.

The authors mention that CLIP-based codes, which are used by the semantic editing feature of DALLE-2, might not be applicable broadly to other models - in this context, other models could possibly refer to other general diffusion-based approaches.

Which could capture more expressivity,"Our evaluation results are summarized in Figure 10(a).We highlight four observations of particular interest:First, the semantic reconstruction quality of our method and many of the baselines is comparable to simply sampling random images from the training set.Second, the single-word method achieves comparable reconstruction quality, and considerably improved editability over all multi-word baselines. These points outline the impressive flexibility of the textual embedding space, showing that it can serve to capture new concepts with a high degree of accuracy while using only a single pseudo-word.

1365,What existing baselines are there? Thought this was the first work.,"We begin by demonstrating our ability to capture and recreate variations of an object using a single pseudo-word. In Figure 3 we compare our method to two baselines: LDM guided by a human caption and DALLE-2 guided by either a human caption or an image prompt. Captions were collected using Mechanical Turk. Annotators were provided with four images of a concept and asked to describe it in a manner that could allow an artist to recreate it. We asked for both a short (\leq 12 words) and a long (\leq 30 words) caption. In total, we collected 10 captions per concept — five short and five long. Figure 3 shows multiple results generated with a randomly chosen caption for each setup. Additional large-scale galleries showing our uncurated reconstructions are provided in the supplementary. To provide intuition for the scale of the results, we add two reference baselines.First, we consider the expected behavior from a model that always produces copies of the training set, regardless of the prompt. For that, we simply use the training set itself as the “generated sample”.Second, we consider a model that always aligns with the text prompt but ignores the personalized concept. We do so by synthesizing images using the evaluation prompts but without the pseudo-word.We denote these setups as “Image Only” and “Prompt Only”, respectively. Our evaluation results are summarized in Figure 10(a).We highlight four observations of particular interest:First, the semantic reconstruction quality of our method and many of the baselines is comparable to simply sampling random images from the training set.Second, the single-word method achieves comparable reconstruction quality, and considerably improved editability over all multi-word baselines.

One reference baseline they create merely spews out images from the train set itself, while ignoring the new prompt. The second reference baseline that they create is a model which uses the text prompt only, while ignoring the personalization aspect of their task. In addition, they also compare the ability of their model to generate variations of an existing image to two existing approaches: namely, DALLE-2 and LDM.",It depends on the specific task and the expected distribution of the target sequence,0.1066666639786667,0.0,0.079999997312,0.5618036648822435,17.195417381850156,15.3008944435981,0.0328227571115973,0.0016252612026932,0.2611180543899536,0.5661753115057946,0.256809800863266,0.5276214480400085,0.008249724494614,,0.7309432767664061,0.7811637488966183
1366,What are transformation modules? Is this related to transformers?,"Introducing new concepts into large scale models is often difficult. Re-training a model with an expanded dataset for each new concept is prohibitively expensive, and fine-tuning on few examples typically leads to catastrophic forgetting (Ding et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022). More measured approaches freeze the model and train transformation modules to adapt its output when faced with new concepts (Zhou et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2021; Skantze & Willemsen, 2022). However, these approaches are still prone to forgetting prior knowledge, or face difficulties in accessing it concurrently with newly learned concepts (Kumar et al., 2022; Cohen et al., 2022).","The authors explain how trainable “transformation modules” attached to a frozen (non-trainable) base model might allow for existing models to be used for new concepts, instead of finetuning or retraining (both of which have their associated challenges). In this context, it is probable that the authors used transformation modules as a general term to refer to a layer or module that is able to perform some transformation (or change) on its input. There is no information to suggest that they are specifically referring to transformers, nor do they explicitly define the exact structure of the aforementioned transformation modules.","To investigate the robustness of pretraining and its potential connections to the learning abilities of language models, by experimenting with pretraining on different domains, perturbations, and languages",0.103092779887342,0.0,0.0824742231863111,0.593466896014511,28.401977459021964,24.33799988615851,0.0578034682080924,0.0028641137159223,0.2490968555212021,0.5259528157735303,0.3906861543655395,0.3624789714813232,0.0096971903110588,,0.751920323688168,0.7960118654127197
1367,How do they show that single word embeddings capture unique and varied concepts?,"As our results demonstrate, our method better captures the unique details of the concept. Human captioning typically captures the most prominent features of an object, but provides insufficient detail to reconstruct finer features like color patterns (e.g. of the teapot). In some cases (e.g. the skull mug) the object itself may be exceedingly difficult to describe through natural language. When provided with an image, DALLE-2 is able to recreate more appealing samples, particularly for well-known objects with limited detail (Aladdin’s lamp). However, it still struggles with unique details of personalized objects that the image encoder (CLIP) is unlikely to have seen (mug, teapot). In contrast, our method can successfully capture these finer details, and it does so using only a single word embedding. However, note that while our creations are more similar to the source objects, they are still variations that may differ from the source.

They allow users to synthesize novel scenes with unseen compositions and produce vivid pictures in a myriad of styles. These tools have been used for artistic creation, as sources of inspiration, and even to design new, physical products (Yacoubian, 2022). Their use, however, is constrained by the user’s ability to describe the desired target through text.

How could we, as users, ask text-to-image models to craft a novel scene containing a cherished childhood toy?

The article mentions that brain tumors have a hierarchical layout of sub-components, and this is supported by various experiments. For example, the reference segmentations provided in the BRATS challenge (Menze et al., 2015) include four tumor tissue classes: necrotic core, edema, non-enhancing, and enhancing core. This hierarchical layout reflects the complex nature of brain tumors, where different sub-components have different characteristics and behaviors.

Experiments have shown that this hierarchical layout is important for accurately assessing the relative volume of tumor sub-components, which is crucial for planning radiotherapy and treatment follow-up (Wen et al., 2010).

1371,What is the key difference btw GANs and Diffusion models that leads to piror work on inversions not being helpful here?,"Manipulating images with generative networks often requires one to find a corresponding latent representation of the given image, a process referred to as inversion (Zhu et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2021).In the GAN literature, this inversion is done through either an optimization-based technique (Abdal et al., 2019, 2020; Zhu et al., 2020b; Gu et al., 2020) or by using an encoder (Richardson et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020a; Pidhorskyi et al., 2020; Tov et al., 2021). Optimization methods directly optimize a latent vector, such that feeding it through the GAN will re-create a target image. Encoders leverage a large image set to train a network that maps images to their latent representations. In the realm of diffusion models, inversion can be performed naïvely by adding noise to an image and then de-noising it through the network. However, this process tends to change the image content significantly. Choi et al. (2021) improve inversion by conditioning the denoising process on noised low-pass filter data from the target image.(Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021) demonstrate that the DDIM (Song et al., 2020) sampling process can be inverted in a closed-form manner, extracting a latent noise map that will produce a given real image. In DALL-E 2 (Ramesh et al., 2022), they build on this method and demonstrate that it can be used to induce changes in the image, such as cross-image interpolations or semantic editing. The later relies on their use of CLIP-based codes to condition the model, and may not be applicable to other methods. Below, we outline the core details of applying our approach to a specific class of generative models — Latent Diffusion Models (Rombach et al., 2021). In Section 5, we then analyze a set of extensions to this approach, motivated by GAN-inversion literature. However, as we later show, these additional complexities fail to improve upon the initial representation, presented here. Inversion into an uncharted latent space provides us with a wide range of possible design choices. Here, we examine these choices in light of the GAN inversion literature and discover that many core premises (such as a distortion-editability tradeoff (Tov et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2020b)) also exist in the textual embedding space. However, our analysis reveals that many of the solutions typically used in GAN inversion fail to generalize to this space, and are often unhelpful or actively harmful. We further investigate a series of extensions based on tools typically used in Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion. Our analysis reveals that, while some core principles remain, applying the prior art in a naïve way is either unhelpful or actively harmful. Text-guided image synthesis has been widely studied in the context of GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Typically, a conditional model is trained to reproduce samples from given paired image-caption datasets (Zhu et al., 2019; Tao et al., 2020), leveraging attention mechanisms (Xu et al., 2018) or cross-modal contrastive approaches (Zhang et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2021). More recently, impressive visual results were achieved by leveraging large scale auto-regressive (Ramesh et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022) or diffusion models (Ramesh et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022; Nichol et al., 2021; Rombach et al., 2021).","GANs and diffusion models are very different classes of models. GANs attempt to invert an image by transforming an input image into a latent vector - this process of inversion occurs by attempting to optimize the latent vector directly, or alternatively by training an image encoder model on a large dataset of images. Diffusion models, on the other hand, primarily function by adding noise to an image, and then training a model to denoise (or remove noise) from these noisy images. The authors attempted to extend their model using ideas from these two classes of models but stated that neither of them resulted in significantly better performance. The exact reason why these strategies do not work is not explicitly discussed in the paper.","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

1372,Are newly trained concepts weaker than prior ones?,"Introducing new concepts into large scale models is often difficult. Re-training a model with an expanded dataset for each new concept is prohibitively expensive, and fine-tuning on few examples typically leads to catastrophic forgetting (Ding et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022). More measured approaches freeze the model and train transformation modules to adapt its output when faced with new concepts (Zhou et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2021; Skantze & Willemsen, 2022). However, these approaches are still prone to forgetting prior knowledge, or face difficulties in accessing it concurrently with newly learned concepts (Kumar et al., 2022; Cohen et al., 2022). While our method offers increased freedom, it may still struggle with learning precise shapes, instead incorporating the “semantic” essence of a concept. For artistic creations, this is often enough. In the future, we hope to achieve better control over the accuracy of the reconstructed concepts, enabling users to leverage our method for tasks that require greater precision.","If this question on whether newly trained concepts are weaker, is with regards to existing work, it depends on what specific method is used. For example, the authors mention that finetuning based approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting. If this question is about the authors’ proposed approach, the answer is a little more unclear, since the question does not define what “weakness” means in this context. The authors explain that some “concepts” (such as those involving specific shapes) are difficult to encode in the proposed approach, but a more thorough answer cannot be found from the text of the paper alone.",To speed up training on D ATA - L,0.0246913560493828,0.0,0.0246913560493828,0.3199741988575836,5.660824461457645,4.684378048269487,0.0140056022408963,0.0009175247221939,0.2267605811357498,0.2767630175198659,0.2441981583833694,0.1312862485647201,0.0016410760788266,,0.7593305806037316,0.7401352028923425
1373,How important is data augmentation for final model accuracy using SSD?,"Without a follow-up feature resampling step as in Faster R-CNN, the classification task for small objects is relatively hard for SSD, as demonstrated in our analysis (see Fig. 4). The data augmentation strategy described in Sec. 2.2 helps to improve the performance dramatically, especially on small datasets such as PASCAL VOC. The random crops generated by the strategy can be thought of as a “zoom in” operation and can generate many larger training examples. To implement a “zoom out” operation that creates more small training examples, we first randomly place an image on a canvas of 16× of the original image size filled with mean values before we do any random crop operation. Because we have more training images by introducing this new “expansion” data augmentation trick, we have to double the training iterations. We have seen a consistent increase of 2%-3% mAP across multiple datasets, as shown in Table 6. In specific, Figure 6 shows that the new augmentation trick significantly improves the performance on small objects. This result underscores the importance of the data augmentation strategy for the final model accuracy.","The data augmentation is improving the performance of SSD on small datasets like PASCAL VOC. The mAP values increase by 2% - 3% on multiple datasets after data augmentation. The new augmentation trick improves the performance on small objects as well. Thus, the data augmentation is quite important for final model accuracy using SSD.",No,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8650519031141869,0.576701268742791,0.0,0.0001851508979818,0.0706150531768798,0.2942984402179718,0.063021719455719,,0.0001458266842133,,0.8703194288548907,0.7068279335314682
1374,How did we get 8732 default bounding box for 300x300 input resolution?,"Multiple output layers at different resolutions is better. A major contribution of SSD is using default boxes of different scales on different output layers. To measure the advantage gained, we progressively remove layers and compare results. For a fair comparison, every time we remove a layer, we adjust the default box tiling to keep the total number of boxes similar to the original (8732). This is done by stacking more scales of boxes on remaining layers and adjusting scales of boxes if needed. We do not exhaustively optimize the tiling for each setting. Table 3 shows a decrease in accuracy with fewer layers, dropping monotonically from 74.3 to 62.4. When we stack boxes of multiple scales on a layer, many are on the image boundary and need to be handled carefully. We tried the strategy used in Faster R-CNN [2], ignoring boxes which are on the boundary. We observe some interesting trends. For example, it hurts the performance by a large margin if we use very coarse feature maps (e.g. conv11 2 (1 × 1) or conv10 2 (3 × 3)). The reason might be that we do not have enough large boxes to cover large objects after the pruning. When we use primarily finer resolution maps, the performance starts increasing again because even after pruning a sufficient number of large boxes remains. If we only use conv7 for prediction, the performance is the worst, reinforcing the message that it is critical to spread boxes of different scales over different layers. Besides, since our predictions do not rely on ROI pooling as in [6], we do not have the collapsing bins problem in low-resolution feature maps [23]. The SSD architecture combines predictions from feature maps of various resolutions to achieve comparable accuracy to Faster R-CNN, while using lower resolution input images.",The 8732 default bounding boxes are obtained for 300x300 input resolution by stacking more scales of boxes on remaining layers and adjusting scales of boxes if needed.,"Sure!

1376,"For creating feature maps, did SSD extracted features from single or multiple layers of the network?","To handle different object scales, some methods [4, 9] suggest processing the image at different sizes and combining the results afterwards. However, by utilizing feature maps from several different layers in a single network for prediction we can mimic the same effect, while also sharing parameters across all object scales. Previous works [10, 11] have shown that using feature maps from the lower layers can improve semantic segmentation quality because the lower layers capture more fine details of the input objects. Similarly,  [12] showed that adding global context pooled from a feature map can help smooth the segmentation results. Motivated by these methods, we use both the lower and upper feature maps for detection. Figure 1 shows two exemplar feature maps (8\times 8 and 4\times 4) which are used in the framework.

1380,Increasing the input size improved the detection for small objects. Is this true?,"To understand the performance of our two SSD models in more details, we used the detection analysis tool from [21]. Figure 3 shows that SSD can detect various object categories with high quality (large white area). The majority of its confident detections are correct. The recall is around 85-90%, and is much higher with “weak” (0.1 jaccard overlap) criteria. Compared to R-CNN [22], SSD has less localization error, indicating that SSD can localize objects better because it directly learns to regress the object shape and classify object categories instead of using two decoupled steps. However, SSD has more confusions with similar object categories (especially for animals), partly because we share locations for multiple categories. Figure 4 shows that SSD is very sensitive to the bounding box size. In other words, it has much worse performance on smaller objects than bigger objects. This is not surprising because those small objects may not even have any information at the very top layers. Increasing the input size (e.g. from 300\times 300 to 512\times 512) can help improve detecting small objects, but there is still a lot of room to improve. On the positive side, we can clearly see that SSD performs really well on large objects.

1389,How scales of the default bounding boxes for a particular feature map is computed? ,"Feature maps from different levels within a network are known to have different (empirical) receptive field sizes [13]. Fortunately, within the SSD framework, the default boxes do not necessary need to correspond to the actual receptive fields of each layer.We design the tiling of default boxes so that specific feature maps learn to be responsive to particular scales of the objects. Suppose we want to use m feature maps for prediction. The scale of the default boxes for each feature map is computed as:s_{k}=s_{\text{min}}+\frac{s_{\text{max}}-s_{\text{min}}}{m-1}(k-1),\quad k\in[1,m](4)where s_{\text{min}} is 0.2 and s_{\text{max}} is 0.9, meaning the lowest layer has a scale of 0.2 and the highest layer has a scale of 0.9, and all layers in between are regularly spaced. We impose different aspect ratios for the default boxes, and denote them as a_{r}\in\{1,2,3,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3}\}. We can compute the width (w_{k}^{a}=s_{k}\sqrt{a_{r}}) and height (h_{k}^{a}=s_{k}/\sqrt{a_{r}}) for each default box. For the aspect ratio of 1, we also add a default box whose scale is s^{\prime}_{k}=\sqrt{s_{k}s_{k+1}}, resulting in 6 default boxes per feature map location. We set the center of each default box to (\frac{i+0.5}{|f_{k}|},\frac{j+0.5}{|f_{k}|}), where |f_{k}| is the size of the k-th square feature map, i,j\in[0,|f_{k}|). In practice, one can also design a distribution of default boxes to best fit a specific dataset. How to design the optimal tiling is an open question as well.","The scale of the default boxes for each feature map is computed as:s_{k}=s_{\text{min}}+\frac{s_{\text{max}}-s_{\text{min}}}{m-1}(k-1),\quad k\in[1,m](4)where s_{\text{min}} is 0.2 and s_{\text{max}} is 0.9, meaning the lowest layer has a scale of 0.2 and the highest layer has a scale of 0.9, and all layers in between are regularly spaced.",No,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.825082508250825,0.5500550055005501,0.0,0.0002127206977238,-0.0741468071937561,0.2992604672908783,-0.0741469115018844,,0.0004107525126512,,0.0,0.7232090318881185
1390,"How did SSD handle Object localization better than F-CNN ? 
","To understand the performance of our two SSD models in more details, we used the detection analysis tool from [21]. Figure 3 shows that SSD can detect various object categories with high quality (large white area). The majority of its confident detections are correct. The recall is around 85-90%, and is much higher with “weak” (0.1 jaccard overlap) criteria. Compared to R-CNN [22], SSD has less localization error, indicating that SSD can localize objects better because it directly learns to regress the object shape and classify object categories instead of using two decoupled steps. However, SSD has more confusions with similar object categories (especially for animals), partly because we share locations for multiple categories. Figure 4 shows that SSD is very sensitive to the bounding box size. In other words, it has much worse performance on smaller objects than bigger objects. This is not surprising because those small objects may not even have any information at the very top layers. Increasing the input size (e.g. from 300\times 300 to 512\times 512) can help improve detecting small objects, but there is still a lot of room to improve. On the positive side, we can clearly see that SSD performs really well on large objects.

If N=0, wet set the loss to 0. The localization loss is a Smooth L1 loss [6] between the predicted box (l) and the ground truth box (g) parameters.

This can be efficiently and elegantly implemented by a channel shuffle operation (Fig 1 (c)): suppose a convolutional layer with g groups whose output has g\times n channels; we first reshape the output channel dimension into (g,n), transposing and then flattening it back as the input of next layer. Note that the operation still takes effect even if the two convolutions have different numbers of groups. Moreover, channel shuffle is also differentiable, which means it can be embedded into network structures for end-to-end training. Channel shuffle operation makes it possible to build more powerful structures with multiple group convolutional layers. In the next subsection we will introduce an efficient network unit with channel shuffle and group convolution. The purpose of shuffle operation is to enable cross-group information flow for multiple group convolution layers. Table 3 compares the performance of ShuffleNet structures (group number is set to 3 or 8 for instance) with/without channel shuffle. The evaluations are performed under three different scales of complexity. It is clear that channel shuffle consistently boosts classification scores for different settings. Especially, when group number is relatively large (e.g. g=8), models with channel shuffle outperform the counterparts by a significant margin, which shows the importance of cross-group information interchange. To the best of our knowledge, the idea of channel shuffle operation is rarely mentioned in previous work on efficient model design, although CNN library cuda-convnet [20] supports “random sparse convolution” layer, which is equivalent to random channel shuffle followed by a group convolutional layer. Such “random shuffle” operation has different purpose and been seldom exploited later. Very recently, another concurrent work  [41] also adopt this idea for a two-stage convolution. However,  [41] did not specially investigate the effectiveness of channel shuffle itself and its usage in tiny model design.","The group convolution and channel shuffle are clearly described and evaluated in the paper. The authors claim that random scarce convolution is similar to channel shuffle with group convolution. However, since the purpose of random scarce convolution is different and is not described, it is hard to tell just by the paper, how exactly they are similar.","Sure!

1399,How channel shuffle operation works for two groups?,"If we allow group convolution to obtain input data from different groups (as shown in Fig 1 (b)), the input and output channels will be fully related. Specifically, for the feature map generated from the previous group layer, we can first divide the channels in each group into several subgroups, then feed each group in the next layer with different subgroups. This can be efficiently and elegantly implemented by a channel shuffle operation (Fig 1 (c)): suppose a convolutional layer with g groups whose output has g\times n channels; we first reshape the output channel dimension into (g,n), transposing and then flattening it back as the input of next layer. Note that the operation still takes effect even if the two convolutions have different numbers of groups. Moreover, channel shuffle is also differentiable, which means it can be embedded into network structures for end-to-end training. In ShuffleNet units, group number g controls the connection sparsity of pointwise convolutions. Table 1 explores different group numbers and we adapt the output channels to ensure overall computation cost roughly unchanged (\sim140 MFLOPs). Obviously, larger group numbers result in more output channels (thus more convolutional filters) for a given complexity constraint, which helps to encode more information, though it might also lead to degradation for an individual convolutional filter due to limited corresponding input channels. In Sec 4.1.1 we will study the impact of this number subject to different computational constrains. Table 2 also shows that for some models (e.g. ShuffleNet 0.5\times) when group numbers become relatively large (e.g. g=8), the classification score saturates or even drops. With an increase in group number (thus wider feature maps), input channels for each convolutional filter become fewer, which may harm representation capability. Interestingly, we also notice that for smaller models such as ShuffleNet 0.25\times larger group numbers tend to better results consistently, which suggests wider feature maps bring more benefits for smaller models. The purpose of shuffle operation is to enable cross-group information flow for multiple group convolution layers. Table 3 compares the performance of ShuffleNet structures (group number is set to 3 or 8 for instance) with/without channel shuffle.

Especially, when group number is relatively large (e.g. g=8), models with channel shuffle outperform the counterparts by a significant margin, which shows the importance of cross-group information interchange.","In the case of channel shuffle operation for two groups, each group is divided into two and shuffled so each new group has a subgroup from both old groups. For example, |A|B| -> |aa|bb| -> |ab|ab|. In terms of performance, two groups seem to work consistently better than the single group case and consistently worse than having more than 2 groups.","Sure! Here's my answer:

1400,Why it is possible to say that multiple group convolutional layers works efficiently without weakening representation?,"If we allow group convolution to obtain input data from different groups (as shown in Fig 1 (b)), the input and output channels will be fully related.

Moreover, channel shuffle is also differentiable, which means it can be embedded into network structures for end-to-end training. From the results, we see that models with group convolutions (g>1) consistently perform better than the counterparts without pointwise group convolutions (g=1). Smaller models tend to benefit more from groups. For example, for ShuffleNet 1\times the best entry (g=8) is 1.2% better than the counterpart, while for ShuffleNet 0.5\times and 0.25\times the gaps become 3.5% and 4.4% respectively. Note that group convolution allows more feature map channels for a given complexity constraint, so we hypothesize that the performance gain comes from wider feature maps which help to encode more information. In addition, a smaller network involves thinner feature maps, meaning it benefits more from enlarged feature maps. Table 2 also shows that for some models (e.g. ShuffleNet 0.5\times) when group numbers become relatively large (e.g. g=8), the classification score saturates or even drops.

The concept of group convolution, which was first introduced in AlexNet [21] for distributing the model over two GPUs, has been well demonstrated its effectiveness in ResNeXt [40]. Depthwise separable convolution proposed in Xception [3] generalizes the ideas of separable convolutions in Inception series [34, 32]. Recently, MobileNet [12] utilizes the depthwise separable convolutions and gains state-of-the-art results among lightweight models. Our work generalizes group convolution and depthwise separable convolution in a novel form. Modern convolutional neural networks [30, 33, 34, 32, 9, 10] usually consist of repeated building blocks with the same structure. Among them, state-of-the-art networks such as Xception [3] and ResNeXt [40] introduce efficient depthwise separable convolutions or group convolutions into the building blocks to strike an excellent trade-off between representation capability and computational cost. However, we notice that both designs do not fully take the 1\times 1 convolutions (also called pointwise convolutions in  [12]) into account, which require considerable complexity. For example, in ResNeXt [40] only 3\times 3 layers are equipped with group convolutions. As a result, for each residual unit in ResNeXt the pointwise convolutions occupy 93.4% multiplication-adds (cardinality = 32 as suggested in  [40]). In tiny networks, expensive pointwise convolutions result in limited number of channels to meet the complexity constraint, which might significantly damage the accuracy. To address the issue, a straightforward solution is to apply channel sparse connections, for example group convolutions, also on 1\times 1 layers. By ensuring that each convolution operates only on the corresponding input channel group, group convolution significantly reduces computation cost. However, if multiple group convolutions stack together, there is one side effect: outputs from a certain channel are only derived from a small fraction of input channels. Fig 1 (a) illustrates a situation of two stacked group convolution layers. It is clear that outputs from a certain group only relate to the inputs within the group. This property blocks information flow between channel groups and weakens representation.","It is clearly stated in the paper that having group convolutions is a trade-off between representative capability and the computational cost of the model. The ShuffleNet allows stacking multiple group convolutions with an appropriate number of groups because of channel shuffle and it is empirically shown in the paper. However, it is also noted that having too many groups might sometimes damage the performance. Thus, multiple group convolutions work efficiently only when the number of groups is chosen carefully and channel shuffle is used.","Sure! Here's my answer:

To overcome the side effects brought by group convolutions, we come up with a novel channel shuffle operation to help the information flowing across feature channels. Based on the two techniques, we build a highly efficient architecture called ShuffleNet. Compared with popular structures like  [30, 9, 40], for a given computation complexity budget, our ShuffleNet allows more feature map channels, which helps to encode more information and is especially critical to the performance of very small networks.

Table 1 explores different group numbers and we adapt the output channels to ensure overall computation cost roughly unchanged (\sim140 MFLOPs). Obviously, larger group numbers result in more output channels (thus more convolutional filters) for a given complexity constraint, which helps to encode more information, though it might also lead to degradation for an individual convolutional filter due to limited corresponding input channels. In Sec 4.1.1 we will study the impact of this number subject to different computational constrains. Table 2 also shows that for some models (e.g. ShuffleNet 0.5\times) when group numbers become relatively large (e.g. g=8), the classification score saturates or even drops. With an increase in group number (thus wider feature maps), input channels for each convolutional filter become fewer, which may harm representation capability. Interestingly, we also notice that for smaller models such as ShuffleNet 0.25\times larger group numbers tend to better results consistently, which suggests wider feature maps bring more benefits for smaller models. To address the issue, a straightforward solution is to apply channel sparse connections, for example group convolutions, also on 1\times 1 layers. By ensuring that each convolution operates only on the corresponding input channel group, group convolution significantly reduces computation cost. However, if multiple group convolutions stack together, there is one side effect: outputs from a certain channel are only derived from a small fraction of input channels. Fig 1 (a) illustrates a situation of two stacked group convolution layers. It is clear that outputs from a certain group only relate to the inputs within the group. This property blocks information flow between channel groups and weakens representation.",The side effects of group convolutions are: blocked flow of information between channel groups when multiple group convolutions are combined; and damaged individual convolution filters for each group due to decreased number of input channels.,"The author uses a regular-expression-based word tokenizer (PTB Tokenizer) to tokenize each paragraph and question, allowing the model to handle input of varying lengths",0.2264150894268424,0.0,0.1509433913136349,1.5167145487126126,22.18175858849291,19.20498913264408,0.08130081300813,0.0076824583866837,-0.0171185005456209,0.3971985762551326,-0.0171184800565242,0.5913410782814026,0.0047167845962662,,0.6966141109823369,0.7171431527057177
1408,Is the theoretical speedup greater than the actual speedup when comparing ShuffleNet to AlexNet on real hardware?,"We also examine the speedup on real hardware, i.e. an off-the-shelf ARM-based computing core. The ShuffleNet model achieves \sim13\times actual speedup (theoretical speedup is 18\times) over AlexNet [21] while maintaining comparable accuracy. Table 6 compares our ShuffleNet with a few popular models. Results show that with similar accuracy ShuffleNet is much more efficient than others. For example, ShuffleNet 0.5\times is theoretically 18\times faster than AlexNet [21] with comparable classification score. We will evaluate the actual running time in Sec 4.5. Finally, we evaluate the actual inference speed of ShuffleNet models on a mobile device with an ARM platform. Though ShuffleNets with larger group numbers (e.g. g=4 or g=8) usually have better performance, we find it less efficient in our current implementation. Empirically g=3 usually has a proper trade-off between accuracy and actual inference time. As shown in Table 8, three input resolutions are exploited for the test. Due to memory access and other overheads, we find every 4\times theoretical complexity reduction usually results in \sim2.6\times actual speedup in our implementation. Nevertheless, compared with AlexNet [21] our ShuffleNet 0.5\times model still achieves \sim13\times actual speedup under comparable classification accuracy (the theoretical speedup is 18\times), which is much faster than previous AlexNet-level models or speedup approaches such as  [14, 16, 22, 42, 43, 38].","Yes, while the theoretical speedup of ShuffleNet is 18 times, the actual speedup is only ~13 times, compared to the AlexNet on the real hardware.",SSD matches the default bounding box with ground truth ones using a combination of Jaccard overlap and a threshold-based matching strategy,0.1025640975673901,0.0,0.1025640975673901,1.4763939041893883,15.636951464923724,12.842521818348414,0.0354609929078014,0.0086741016109045,0.0940884500741958,0.3117601850903347,0.0940884202718734,0.3859502375125885,0.0034076750451014,,0.7593092991824762,0.7310552576497835

1411,How ShuffleNet allowed more feature maps for a given computational complexity?,"We notice that state-of-the-art basic architectures such as Xception [3] and ResNeXt [40] become less efficient in extremely small networks because of the costly dense 1\times 1 convolutions. We propose using pointwise group convolutions to reduce computation complexity of 1\times 1 convolutions. To overcome the side effects brought by group convolutions, we come up with a novel channel shuffle operation to help the information flowing across feature channels. Based on the two techniques, we build a highly efficient architecture called ShuffleNet. Compared with popular structures like  [30, 9, 40], for a given computation complexity budget, our ShuffleNet allows more feature map channels, which helps to encode more information and is especially critical to the performance of very small networks. Thanks to pointwise group convolution with channel shuffle, all components in ShuffleNet unit can be computed efficiently. Compared with ResNet [9] (bottleneck design) and ResNeXt [40], our structure has less complexity under the same settings. For example, given the input size c\times h\times w and the bottleneck channels m, ResNet unit requires hw(2cm+9m^{2}) FLOPs and ResNeXt has hw(2cm+9m^{2}/g) FLOPs, while our ShuffleNet unit requires only hw(2cm/g+9m) FLOPs, where g means the number of groups for convolutions. In other words, given a computational budget, ShuffleNet can use wider feature maps. We find this is critical for small networks, as tiny networks usually have an insufficient number of channels to process the information. From the results, we see that models with group convolutions (g>1) consistently perform better than the counterparts without pointwise group convolutions (g=1). Smaller models tend to benefit more from groups. For example, for ShuffleNet 1\times the best entry (g=8) is 1.2% better than the counterpart, while for ShuffleNet 0.5\times and 0.25\times the gaps become 3.5% and 4.4% respectively. Note that group convolution allows more feature map channels for a given complexity constraint, so we hypothesize that the performance gain comes from wider feature maps which help to encode more information. In addition, a smaller network involves thinner feature maps, meaning it benefits more from enlarged feature maps. Table 2 also shows that for some models (e.g. ShuffleNet 0.5\times) when group numbers become relatively large (e.g. g=8), the classification score saturates or even drops.

Interestingly, we also notice that for smaller models such as ShuffleNet 0.25\times larger group numbers tend to better results consistently, which suggests wider feature maps bring more benefits for smaller models. We use exactly the same settings to train these models. Results are shown in Table 4. Our ShuffleNet models outperform most others by a significant margin under different complexities. Interestingly, we find an empirical relationship between feature map channels and classification accuracy. For example, under the complexity of 38 MFLOPs, output channels of Stage 4 (see Table 1) for VGG-like, ResNet, ResNeXt, Xception-like, ShuffleNet models are 50, 192, 192, 288, 576 respectively, which is consistent with the increase of accuracy. Since the efficient design of ShuffleNet, we can use more channels for a given computation budget, thus usually resulting in better performance.","The ShuffleNet uses pointwise group convolution with channel shuffling, thus design-wise it has less complexity (requires hw(2cm/g+9m) FLOPs).

1412,Which networks introduced efficient depthwise seperable convolution into the building blocks of a state-of-the-art network?,"We notice that state-of-the-art basic architectures such as Xception [3] and ResNeXt [40] become less efficient in extremely small networks because of the costly dense 1\times 1 convolutions.

Such drawback is also referred in  [3], which has a runtime library based on TensorFlow [1]. In ShuffleNet units, we intentionally use depthwise convolution only on bottleneck in order to prevent overhead as much as possible. Recent leading convolutional units in VGG [30], ResNet [9], GoogleNet [33], ResNeXt [40] and Xception [3] have pursued state-of-the-art results with large models (e.g. \geq 1GFLOPs), but do not fully explore low-complexity conditions. In this section we survey a variety of building blocks and make comparisons with ShuffleNet under the same complexity constraint. Recently Howard et al. have proposed MobileNets [12] which mainly focus on efficient network architecture for mobile devices. MobileNet takes the idea of depthwise separable convolution from  [3] and achieves state-of-the-art results on small models. The concept of group convolution, which was first introduced in AlexNet [21] for distributing the model over two GPUs, has been well demonstrated its effectiveness in ResNeXt [40]. Depthwise separable convolution proposed in Xception [3] generalizes the ideas of separable convolutions in Inception series [34, 32]. Recently, MobileNet [12] utilizes the depthwise separable convolutions and gains state-of-the-art results among lightweight models. Our work generalizes group convolution and depthwise separable convolution in a novel form. Modern convolutional neural networks [30, 33, 34, 32, 9, 10] usually consist of repeated building blocks with the same structure. Among them, state-of-the-art networks such as Xception [3] and ResNeXt [40] introduce efficient depthwise separable convolutions or group convolutions into the building blocks to strike an excellent trade-off between representation capability and computational cost.

As a result, for each residual unit in ResNeXt the pointwise convolutions occupy 93.4% multiplication-adds (cardinality = 32 as suggested in  [40]). In tiny networks, expensive pointwise convolutions result in limited number of channels to meet the complexity constraint, which might significantly damage the accuracy.","Although AlexNet introduced the idea of group convolutions, the Xception and ResNeXt generalized depthwise separable convolutions and achieved state-of-the-art results under large computationl budget (~1 GFLOPs).","To accommodate the extra ""end-of-sequence"" token and all-zero frame appended to each input sequence",0.1052631532409974,0.0,0.1052631532409974,1.4262733286728255,21.620500456966056,17.624202708572547,0.0349650349650349,0.0057995028997514,0.1985945552587509,0.28775927216023,0.1985945254564285,0.4126794636249542,0.0043210111464426,,0.7230020378699158,0.7191901147998353

Such drawback is also referred in  [3], which has a runtime library based on TensorFlow [1]. In ShuffleNet units, we intentionally use depthwise convolution only on bottleneck in order to prevent overhead as much as possible. To customize the network to a desired complexity, we can simply apply a scale factor s on the number of channels. For example, we denote the networks in Table 1 as ”ShuffleNet 1\times”, then ”ShuffleNet s×s\timesitalic_s ×” means scaling the number of filters in ShuffleNet 1\times by s times thus overall complexity will be roughly s^{2} times of ShuffleNet 1\times. Recent leading convolutional units in VGG [30], ResNet [9], GoogleNet [33], ResNeXt [40] and Xception [3] have pursued state-of-the-art results with large models (e.g. \geq 1GFLOPs), but do not fully explore low-complexity conditions. In this section we survey a variety of building blocks and make comparisons with ShuffleNet under the same complexity constraint. For fair comparison, we use the overall network architecture as shown in Table 1. We replace the ShuffleNet units in Stage 2-4 with other structures, then adapt the number of channels to ensure the complexity remains unchanged. The structures we explored include: Table 5 compares classification scores under a variety of complexity levels. It is clear that our ShuffleNet models are superior to MobileNet for all the complexities. Though our ShuffleNet network is specially designed for small models (<150 MFLOPs), we find it is still better than MobileNet for higher computation cost, e.g. 3.1% more accurate than MobileNet 1\times at the cost of 500 MFLOPs. For smaller networks (\sim40 MFLOPs) ShuffleNet surpasses MobileNet by 7.8%. Note that our ShuffleNet architecture contains 50 layers while MobileNet only has 28 layers. For better understanding, we also try ShuffleNet on a 26-layer architecture by removing half of the blocks in Stage 2-4 (see ”ShuffleNet 0.5\times shallow (g=3)” in Table 5). Results show that the shallower model is still significantly better than the corresponding MobileNet, which implies that the effectiveness of ShuffleNet mainly results from its efficient structure, not the depth. Finally, we evaluate the actual inference speed of ShuffleNet models on a mobile device with an ARM platform. Though ShuffleNets with larger group numbers (e.g. g=4 or g=8) usually have better performance, we find it less efficient in our current implementation.

1415,"Each convolution operates on that corresponding input channel group. If so, how the model learns the features from entire input space?","If we allow group convolution to obtain input data from different groups (as shown in Fig 1 (b)), the input and output channels will be fully related. Specifically, for the feature map generated from the previous group layer, we can first divide the channels in each group into several subgroups, then feed each group in the next layer with different subgroups. This can be efficiently and elegantly implemented by a channel shuffle operation (Fig 1 (c)): suppose a convolutional layer with g groups whose output has g\times n channels; we first reshape the output channel dimension into (g,n), transposing and then flattening it back as the input of next layer. Note that the operation still takes effect even if the two convolutions have different numbers of groups. Moreover, channel shuffle is also differentiable, which means it can be embedded into network structures for end-to-end training. Channel shuffle operation makes it possible to build more powerful structures with multiple group convolutional layers. In the next subsection we will introduce an efficient network unit with channel shuffle and group convolution. To address the issue, a straightforward solution is to apply channel sparse connections, for example group convolutions, also on 1\times 1 layers. By ensuring that each convolution operates only on the corresponding input channel group, group convolution significantly reduces computation cost. However, if multiple group convolutions stack together, there is one side effect: outputs from a certain channel are only derived from a small fraction of input channels. Fig 1 (a) illustrates a situation of two stacked group convolution layers. It is clear that outputs from a certain group only relate to the inputs within the group. This property blocks information flow between channel groups and weakens representation.","When multiple group convolutions are stacked together, the authors use channel shuffle, which divides the channels into subgroups within groups and shuffles them in a way that each group consists of subgroups from all other groups. It lets the model learn from an entire input space despite the group convolution. However, the paper does not explicitly report such side effects when group convolutions are not stacked together.","Pointwise group convolutions are different from 1x1 convolutions in terms of channel sparsity and information flow. While 1x1 convolutions operate on all channels simultaneously, pointwise group convolutions only operate on a specific group of channels, leading to reduced computation cost but potentially limited information flow between channel groups",0.2696629165307411,0.0373831727626873,0.179775276081303,3.1885116249803693,36.067018842775234,31.828068042699087,0.1341807909604519,0.0079365079365079,0.5815497636795044,0.6839035495136632,0.5755537152290344,0.7495134472846985,0.0291392467824881,1.0,0.8392043240710745,0.8663333086952705
1416,What will be the effect in performance if group numbers for convolution is increased? ,"In ShuffleNet units, group number g controls the connection sparsity of pointwise convolutions. Table 1 explores different group numbers and we adapt the output channels to ensure overall computation cost roughly unchanged (\sim140 MFLOPs). Obviously, larger group numbers result in more output channels (thus more convolutional filters) for a given complexity constraint, which helps to encode more information, though it might also lead to degradation for an individual convolutional filter due to limited corresponding input channels. In Sec 4.1.1 we will study the impact of this number subject to different computational constrains. From the results, we see that models with group convolutions (g>1) consistently perform better than the counterparts without pointwise group convolutions (g=1). Smaller models tend to benefit more from groups.

Table 2 also shows that for some models (e.g. ShuffleNet 0.5\times) when group numbers become relatively large (e.g. g=8), the classification score saturates or even drops. With an increase in group number (thus wider feature maps), input channels for each convolutional filter become fewer, which may harm representation capability. Interestingly, we also notice that for smaller models such as ShuffleNet 0.25\times larger group numbers tend to better results consistently, which suggests wider feature maps bring more benefits for smaller models. Finally, we evaluate the actual inference speed of ShuffleNet models on a mobile device with an ARM platform. Though ShuffleNets with larger group numbers (e.g. g=4 or g=8) usually have better performance, we find it less efficient in our current implementation. Empirically g=3 usually has a proper trade-off between accuracy and actual inference time. As shown in Table 8, three input resolutions are exploited for the test. Due to memory access and other overheads, we find every 4\times theoretical complexity reduction usually results in \sim2.6\times actual speedup in our implementation. Nevertheless, compared with AlexNet [21] our ShuffleNet 0.5\times model still achieves \sim13\times actual speedup under comparable classification accuracy (the theoretical speedup is 18\times), which is much faster than previous AlexNet-level models or speedup approaches such as  [14, 16, 22, 42, 43, 38].","For ShuffleNet, having more than 1 group seems to show consistently better results for all complexities. As the model gets smaller, the performance gain seems to increase more as the number of groups increases. However, for larger models, a too large number of groups led to saturation or a drop in classification error, possibly due to reduced representative capabilities.","The methods that explore the effect of melody awareness include computing Pearson's correlation coefficient of U with C or P scores, as shown in Table 6",0.13888888435571,0.0,0.1111111065779322,0.8781152091398416,23.69400114419129,20.270505124686068,0.0792393026941362,0.0047917434574272,0.042090181261301,0.4184471242280407,0.1328951120376587,0.4407077133655548,0.0030271427555286,0.5,0.755780147480772,0.7164536883571496
1417,Why are dense 1X1 convolutions computationally expensive?,"We notice that state-of-the-art basic architectures such as Xception [3] and ResNeXt [40] become less efficient in extremely small networks because of the costly dense 1\times 1 convolutions. We propose using pointwise group convolutions to reduce computation complexity of 1\times 1 convolutions. To overcome the side effects brought by group convolutions, we come up with a novel channel shuffle operation to help the information flowing across feature channels. Based on the two techniques, we build a highly efficient architecture called ShuffleNet. Compared with popular structures like  [30, 9, 40], for a given computation complexity budget, our ShuffleNet allows more feature map channels, which helps to encode more information and is especially critical to the performance of very small networks. From the results, we see that models with group convolutions (g>1) consistently perform better than the counterparts without pointwise group convolutions (g=1). Smaller models tend to benefit more from groups. For example, for ShuffleNet 1\times the best entry (g=8) is 1.2% better than the counterpart, while for ShuffleNet 0.5\times and 0.25\times the gaps become 3.5% and 4.4% respectively. Note that group convolution allows more feature map channels for a given complexity constraint, so we hypothesize that the performance gain comes from wider feature maps which help to encode more information. In addition, a smaller network involves thinner feature maps, meaning it benefits more from enlarged feature maps. Modern convolutional neural networks [30, 33, 34, 32, 9, 10] usually consist of repeated building blocks with the same structure. Among them, state-of-the-art networks such as Xception [3] and ResNeXt [40] introduce efficient depthwise separable convolutions or group convolutions into the building blocks to strike an excellent trade-off between representation capability and computational cost. However, we notice that both designs do not fully take the 1\times 1 convolutions (also called pointwise convolutions in  [12]) into account, which require considerable complexity. For example, in ResNeXt [40] only 3\times 3 layers are equipped with group convolutions. As a result, for each residual unit in ResNeXt the pointwise convolutions occupy 93.4% multiplication-adds (cardinality = 32 as suggested in  [40]). In tiny networks, expensive pointwise convolutions result in limited number of channels to meet the complexity constraint, which might significantly damage the accuracy.",The 1x1 convolutions are expensive in extremely reduced versions of Xception and ResNeXt as they might take 93.4% of multiplication-adds for each residual unit.,"The number of tasks from each type of continuous control was chosen based on a combination of factors, including the diversity of tasks, the difficulty of tasks, and the representation of different challenges in the field of reinforcement learning.

1438,How is normal cell different from reduction cell for NASNets?,"In our approach, the overall architectures of the convolutional nets are manually predetermined. They are composed of convolutional cells repeated many times where each convolutional cell has the same architecture, but different weights. To easily build scalable architectures for images of any size, we need two types of convolutional cells to serve two main functions when taking in a feature map as input: (1) convolutional cells that return a feature map of the same dimension, and (2) convolutional cells that return a feature map where the feature map height and width is reduced by a factor of two. We name the first type and second type of convolutional cells Normal Cell and Reduction Cell respectively. For the Reduction Cell, we make the initial operation applied to the cell’s inputs have a stride of two to reduce the height and width. All of our operations that we consider for building our convolutional cells have an option of striding. Figure 2 shows our placement of Normal and Reduction Cells for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Note on ImageNet we have more Reduction Cells, since the incoming image size is 299x299 compared to 32x32 for CIFAR.

What varies in the convolutional nets is the structures of the Normal and Reduction Cells, which are searched by the controller RNN.The structures of the cells can be searched within a search space defined as follows (see Appendix, Figure 7 for schematic). In our search space, each cell receives as input two initial hidden states h_{i} and h_{i-1} which are the outputs of two cells in previous two lower layers or the input image. The controller RNN recursively predicts the rest of the structure of the convolutional cell, given these two initial hidden states (Figure 3). The predictions of the controller for each cell are grouped into B blocks, where each block has 5 prediction steps made by 5 distinct softmax classifiers corresponding to discrete choices of the elements of a block: To allow the controller RNN to predict both Normal Cell and Reduction Cell, we simply make the controller have 2\times 5B predictions in total, where the first 5B predictions are for the Normal Cell and the second 5B predictions are for the Reduction Cell.","We learn two separate architectures for reduction and normal cells.

1443,Why does inception-v4’s inception module use average pooling instead of max pooling? ,"Besides a straightforward integration, we have also studied whetherInception itself can be made more efficient by making it deeper and wider.For that purpose, we designed a new version named Inception-v4which has a more uniform simplified architecture and more inception modulesthan Inception-v3. Historically, Inception-v3 had inherited a lot of thebaggage of the earlier incarnations. The technical constraints chiefly came fromthe need for partitioning the model for distributed training usingDistBelief [2].Now, after migrating our training setup to TensorFlow [1]these constraints have been lifted, which allowed us to simplify the architecturesignificantly. The details of that simplified architecture are described in Section 3.",One possible reason to use average pooling instead of max pooling is that max pooling introduces some kind of technical constraints which are reduced by average pooling.

A similar instability was observed by He et al. in [5] inthe case of very deep residual networks and they suggested a two-phasetraining where the first “warm-up” phase is done with very low learningrate, followed by a second phase with high learning rata. We found thatif the number of filters is very high, then even a very low (0.00001) learningrate is not sufficient to cope with the instabilities and the training withhigh learning rate had a chance to destroy its effects.

","In contrast, a one-stage detector must process a much larger set of candidate object locations regularly sampled across an image.

This inefficiency is a classic problem in object detection that is typically addressed via techniques such as bootstrapping [33, 29] or hard example mining [37, 8, 31]. One of the most important design factors in a one-stage detection system is how densely it covers the space of possible image boxes. Two-stage detectors can classify boxes at any position, scale, and aspect ratio using a region pooling operation [10]. In contrast, as one-stage detectors use a fixed sampling grid, a popular approach for achieving high coverage of boxes in these approaches is to use multiple ‘anchors’ [28] at each spatial position to cover boxes of various scales and aspect ratios. OverFeat [30] was one of the first modern one-stage object detector based on deep networks. More recently SSD [22, 9] and YOLO [26, 27] have renewed interest in one-stage methods. These detectors have been tuned for speed but their accuracy trails that of two-stage methods. SSD has a 10-20% lower AP, while YOLO focuses on an even more extreme speed/accuracy trade-off. See Figure 2. Recent work showed that two-stage detectors can be made fast simply by reducing input image resolution and the number of proposals, but one-stage methods trailed in accuracy even with a larger compute budget [17]. In contrast, the aim of this work is to understand if one-stage detectors can match or surpass the accuracy of two-stage detectors while running at similar or faster speeds.","Two-stage detectors can classify boxes at any position, scale, and aspect ratio using a region pooling operation.

We also implement a variant of OHEM used in SSD [22]: after applying nms to all examples, the minibatch is constructed to enforce a 1:3 ratio between positives and negatives to help ensure each minibatch has enough positives.","In OHEM, each example is scored by its loss, non-maximum suppression (nms) is then applied, and a minibatch is constructed with the highest-loss examples.",Blocky predictions,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.485643755299108,8.614232816474331,0.0,0.0008326394671107,0.153292641043663,0.4056964757594656,0.1532926857471466,0.0423463732004165,0.0002378355241678,0.6666666666666666,0.7066009825696383,0.7426023344700026
1456,Is RPN is used as a secondary classifier for proposing boundary boxes for F-RCNN framework ?,"The dominant paradigm in modern object detection is based on a two-stage approach. As pioneered in the Selective Search work [35], the first stage generates a sparse set of candidate proposals that should contain all objects while filtering out the majority of negative locations, and the second stage classifies the proposals into foreground classes / background. R-CNN [11] upgraded the second-stage classifier to a convolutional network yielding large gains in accuracy and ushering in the modern era of object detection. R-CNN was improved over the years, both in terms of speed [15, 10] and by using learned object proposals [6, 24, 28]. Region Proposal Networks (RPN) integrated proposal generation with the second-stage classifier into a single convolution network, forming the Faster R-CNN framework [28].

1457,What are the problems associated with class imbalance for single stage detectors ?,"Both classic one-stage object detection methods, like boosted detectors [37, 5] and DPMs [8], and more recent methods, like SSD [22], face a large class imbalance during training. These detectors evaluate 10^{4}-10^{5} candidate locations per image but only a few locations contain objects. This imbalance causes two problems: (1) training is inefficient as most locations are easy negatives that contribute no useful learning signal; (2) en masse, the easy negatives can overwhelm training and lead to degenerate models. A common solution is to perform some form of hard negative mining [33, 37, 8, 31, 22] that samples hard examples during training or more complex sampling/reweighing schemes [2]. In contrast, we show that our proposed focal loss naturally handles the class imbalance faced by a one-stage detector and allows us to efficiently train on all examples without sampling and without easy negatives overwhelming the loss and computed gradients.",The problems associated with class imbalance for single stage detectors are: 1) Training is inefficient as most locations are easy negatives that contribute no useful learning signal. 2) The large number of easy negatives can overwhelm training and lead to degenerate models.,Model pruning refers to the process of removing redundant connections or channels in a pre-trained neural network to accelerate inference while preserving accuracy,0.06557376588014,0.0,0.06557376588014,0.9243411456936732,26.859383273813847,21.051443552754183,0.0448430493273542,0.005446365143263,0.158158466219902,0.4878237040799709,0.3006277978420257,0.4028717577457428,0.0079537012755799,0.0,0.739934670393271,0.7546242093474342
1458,What are the other loss functions experimented by the authors'? ,"There has been much interest in designing robust loss functions (e.g., Huber loss [13]) that reduce the contribution of outliers by down-weighting the loss of examples with large errors (hard examples). In contrast, rather than addressing outliers, our focal loss is designed to address class imbalance by down-weighting inliers (easy examples) such that their contribution to the total loss is small even if their number is large. In other words, the focal loss performs the opposite role of a robust loss: it focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples. The CE loss can be seen as the blue (top) curve in Figure 1. One notable property of this loss, which can be easily seen in its plot, is that even examples that are easily classified (p_{\textrm{t}}\gg.5) incur a loss with non-trivial magnitude. When summed over a large number of easy examples, these small loss values can overwhelm the rare class. In practice we use an \alpha-balanced variant of the focal loss:\textrm{FL}(p_{\textrm{t}})=-\alpha_{\textrm{t}}(1-p_{\textrm{t}})^{\gamma}\log(p_{\textrm{t}}).(5)We adopt this form in our experiments as it yields slightly improved accuracy over the non-\alpha-balanced form. Finally, we note that the implementation of the loss layer combines the sigmoid operation for computing p with the loss computation, resulting in greater numerical stability. Our next attempt to improve learning involved using the \alpha-balanced CE loss described in §3.1. Results for various \alpha are shown in Table 1a. Setting \alpha=.75 gives a gain of 0.9 points AP. Finally, in early experiments, we attempted to train with the hinge loss [13] on p_{\textrm{t}}, which sets loss to 0 above a certain value of p_{\textrm{t}}. However, this was unstable and we did not manage to obtain meaningful results. Results exploring alternate loss functions are in the appendix. In this paper, we propose a new loss function that acts as a more effective alternative to previous approaches for dealing with class imbalance. The loss function is a dynamically scaled cross entropy loss, where the scaling factor decays to zero as confidence in the correct class increases, see Figure 1. Intuitively, this scaling factor can automatically down-weight the contribution of easy examples during training and rapidly focus the model on hard examples. Experiments show that our proposed Focal Loss enables us to train a high-accuracy, one-stage detector that significantly outperforms the alternatives of training with the sampling heuristics or hard example mining, the previous state-of-the-art techniques for training one-stage detectors. Finally, we note that the exact form of the focal loss is not crucial, and we show other instantiations can achieve similar results.","The main loss function used by authors is The Focal Loss.

1459,How focal loss can be extended to use for multi class problem?,"The Focal Loss is designed to address the one-stage object detection scenario in which there is an extreme imbalance between foreground and background classes during training (e.g., 1:1000). We introduce the focal loss starting from the cross entropy (CE) loss for binary classification111Extending the focal loss to the multi-class case is straightforward and works well; for simplicity we focus on the binary loss in this work.:\textrm{CE}(p,y)=\begin{cases}-\log(p)&\text{if $y=1$}\\-\log(1-p)&\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}(1)In the above y\in\{\pm 1\} specifies the ground-truth class and p\in[0,1] is the model’s estimated probability for the class with label y=1.

1460,"If we have 100000 easy examples (0.1 each) and 100 hard examples (2.3 each),Is it possible calculate percentage loss difference between them?","As our experiments will show, the large class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors overwhelms the cross entropy loss. Easily classified negatives comprise the majority of the loss and dominate the gradient. While \alpha balances the importance of positive/negative examples, it does not differentiate between easy/hard examples. Instead, we propose to reshape the loss function to down-weight easy examples and thus focus training on hard negatives.","Since the imbalance between easy and hard examples is large(100000 vs 100), it is not possible to calculate the percentage loss difference between them.",The authors inferred that the pose network uses image correspondence and the depth estimation network recognizes common structural features based on the synthesis process used in the novel view synthesis task,0.0851063780353103,0.0,0.0851063780353103,1.5805589242774525,17.49606256468589,14.375290416527797,0.0513698630136986,0.0105765950187649,0.0553854517638683,0.2965295194694124,0.0553854294121265,0.2725853621959686,0.0013894756799835,0.0,0.7250007509119735,0.7027861907336277
1461,What is the effect of increasing modulating factor (γ )?,"More formally, we propose to add a modulating factor (1-p_{\textrm{t}})^{\gamma} to the cross entropy loss, with tunable focusing parameter \gamma\geq 0. We define the focal loss as:\textrm{FL}(p_{\textrm{t}})=-(1-p_{\textrm{t}})^{\gamma}\log(p_{\textrm{t}}).(4) Intuitively, the modulating factor reduces the loss contribution from easy examples and extends the range in which an example receives low loss. For instance, with \gamma=2, an example classified with p_{\textrm{t}}=0.9 would have 100×100\times100 × lower loss compared with CE and with p_{\textrm{t}}\approx 0.968 it would have 1000×1000\times1000 × lower loss. This in turn increases the importance of correcting misclassified examples (whose loss is scaled down by at most 4×4\times4 × for p_{\textrm{t}}\leq.5 and \gamma=2).","As specified wrongly in the question, modulating factor is (1-p_{\textrm{t}})^{\gamma} and not \gamma. Besides this as the modulating factor increases, the loss contribution from easy examples is reduced and the range in which an example receives low loss is extended.","The highest performing estimation method for the authors' experiments was the 6 Layer 12 Heads with BERT embeddings setting, which achieved the best results for both summarization and topic segmentation tasks",0.1034482708680145,0.0,0.1034482708680145,0.9147693871438456,24.70670010443449,20.649825772853227,0.0744878957169459,0.0083087644063253,-0.0169368926435709,0.2994204731477263,0.0211514700204134,0.3693087697029114,0.0022777328394242,,0.7591243626550978,0.7258543700094752
1462,Why P needs initialization at the start of the training?,"Binary classification models are by default initialized to have equal probability of outputting either y=-1 or 1. Under such an initialization, in the presence of class imbalance, the loss due to the frequent class can dominate total loss and cause instability in early training. To counter this, we introduce the concept of a ‘prior’ for the value of p estimated by the model for the rare class (foreground) at the start of training. We denote the prior by \pi and set it so that the model’s estimated p for examples of the rare class is low, e.g. 0.01. We note that this is a change in model initialization (see §4.1) and not of the loss function. We found this to improve training stability for both the cross entropy and focal loss in the case of heavy class imbalance.","Since P is one of the parameters in the loss function, we have to initialise P with some value before training. This P is then tuned while training such that the loss value is optimised.",A state-of-the-art model for object recognition on the Cifar10 dataset,0.0555555515432101,0.0,0.0555555515432101,0.969094302009921,18.65185958925981,14.821829062265806,0.0142045454545454,0.002932551319648,0.0830877870321273,0.3289629507809879,0.1579495817422866,0.2818588316440582,0.0145207891821063,0.0,0.7289855543774459,0.7287217331518835
1463,What value of π is used for experimentations ?,"We experiment with ResNet-50-FPN and ResNet-101-FPN backbones [20]. The base ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 models are pre-trained on ImageNet1k; we use the models released by [16]. New layers added for FPN are initialized as in [20]. All new conv layers except the final one in the RetinaNet subnets are initialized with bias b=0 and a Gaussian weight fill with \sigma=0.01. For the final conv layer of the classification subnet, we set the bias initialization to b=-\log((1-\pi)/\pi), where \pi specifies that at the start of training every anchor should be labeled as foreground with confidence of \scriptstyle\sim\pi. We use \pi=.01 in all experiments, although results are robust to the exact value. As explained in §3.3, this initialization prevents the large number of background anchors from generating a large, destabilizing loss value in the first iteration of training. Our first attempt to train RetinaNet uses standard cross entropy (CE) loss without any modifications to the initialization or learning strategy. This fails quickly, with the network diverging during training. However, simply initializing the last layer of our model such that the prior probability of detecting an object is \pi=.01 (see §4.1) enables effective learning.

As each anchor is assigned to at most one object box, we set the corresponding entry in its length K label vector to 1 and all other entries to 0.

1467,How classification subnet is different from regression subnet?,"In parallel with the object classification subnet, we attach another small FCN to each pyramid level for the purpose of regressing the offset from each anchor box to a nearby ground-truth object, if one exists. The design of the box regression subnet is identical to the classification subnet except that it terminates in 4A linear outputs per spatial location, see Figure 3 (d). For each of the A anchors per spatial location, these 4 outputs predict the relative offset between the anchor and the ground-truth box (we use the standard box parameterization from R-CNN [11]).

1468,Why the normalization wasn't done taken all anchors into account?,"We use the focal loss introduced in this work as the loss on the output of the classification subnet. As we will show in §5, we find that \gamma=2 works well in practice and the RetinaNet is relatively robust to \gamma\in[0.5,5]. We emphasize that when training RetinaNet, the focal loss is applied to all \scriptstyle\sim100k anchors in each sampled image. This stands in contrast to common practice of using heuristic sampling (RPN) or hard example mining (OHEM, SSD) to select a small set of anchors (e.g., 256) for each minibatch. The total focal loss of an image is computed as the sum of the focal loss over all \scriptstyle\sim100k anchors, normalized by the number of anchors assigned to a ground-truth box. We perform the normalization by the number of assigned anchors, not total anchors, since the vast majority of anchors are easy negatives and receive negligible loss values under the focal loss. Finally we note that \alpha, the weight assigned to the rare class, also has a stable range, but it interacts with \gamma making it necessary to select the two together (see Tables 1a and 1b). In general \alpha should be decreased slightly as \gamma is increased (for \gamma=2, \alpha=0.25 works best).",The normalisation is not done by taking all anchors into account because vast majority of anchors are easy negatives and receive negligible loss values under the focal loss.,"The simple bypass achieved a higher accuracy improvement than the complex bypass because it allowed the network to learn more robust features by adding direct connections between layers, bypassing the complex non-linear transformations in the network",0.1428571378826532,0.0,0.1071428521683675,1.3809925785102002,20.946321287253625,17.12557700909589,0.0838926174496644,0.0107913669064748,0.2529159486293793,0.3670155914202333,0.2529158294200897,0.3449461460113525,0.0051723056549438,0.0,0.7658019411535548,0.771431751567723

1471,Did increase in Anchor Density improves AP?,"We sweep over the number of scale and aspect ratio anchors used at each spatial position and each pyramid level in FPN. We consider cases from a single square anchor at each location to 12 anchors per location spanning 4 sub-octave scales (2^{k/4}, for k\leq 3) and 3 aspect ratios [0.5, 1, 2]. Results using ResNet-50 are shown in Table 1c. A surprisingly good AP (30.3) is achieved using just one square anchor. However, the AP can be improved by nearly 4 points (to 34.0) when using 3 scales and 3 aspect ratios per location. We used this setting for all other experiments in this work. Finally, we note that increasing beyond 6-9 anchors did not shown further gains. Thus while two-stage systems can classify arbitrary boxes in an image, the saturation of performance w.r.t. density implies the higher potential density of two-stage systems may not offer an advantage.","Increasing anchor density does improve the AP value, but beyond 6-9 anchors, there was no further gain.","The first tool is software that interactively plots the activations produced on each layer of a trained DNN for user-provided images or video, allowing for a slow, detailed investigation of a particular input.

1472,What is the issue with intractable posterior distribution?,"Very importantly, we do not make the common simplifying assumptions about the marginal or posterior probabilities. Conversely, we are here interested in a general algorithm that even works efficiently in the case of:1.Intractability: the case where the integral of the marginal likelihood p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})=\int p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})\,d\mathbf{z} is intractable (so we cannot evaluate or differentiate the marginal likelihood), where the true posterior density p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})=p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})/p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}) is intractable (so the EM algorithm cannot be used), and where the required integrals for any reasonable mean-field VB algorithm are also intractable. These intractabilities are quite common and appear in cases of moderately complicated likelihood functions p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}), e.g. a neural network with a nonlinear hidden layer.2.A large dataset: we have so much data that batch optimization is too costly; we would like to make parameter updates using small minibatches or even single datapoints. Sampling-based solutions, e.g. Monte Carlo EM, would in general be too slow, since it involves a typically expensive sampling loop per datapoint.","The variational Bayesian (VB) approach involves the optimization of an approximation to the intractable posterior. The existing method, mean-field variational inference requires factorial.

1473,What are the steps in AEVB algorithm?,"How can we perform efficient approximate inference and learning with directed probabilistic modelswhose continuous latent variables and/or parameters have intractable posterior distributions?The variational Bayesian (VB) approach involves the optimization of an approximation to the intractable posterior. Unfortunately, the common mean-field approach requires analytical solutions of expectations w.r.t. the approximate posterior, which are also intractable in the general case. We show how a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a simple differentiable unbiased estimator of the lower bound; this SGVB (Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes) estimator can be used for efficient approximate posterior inference in almost any model with continuous latent variables and/or parameters, and is straightforward to optimize using standard stochastic gradient ascent techniques. For the case of an i.i.d. dataset and continuous latent variables per datapoint, we propose the Auto-Encoding VB (AEVB) algorithm. In the AEVB algorithm we make inference and learning especially efficient by using the SGVB estimator to optimize a recognition model that allows us to perform very efficient approximate posterior inference using simple ancestral sampling, which in turn allows us to efficiently learn the model parameters, without the need of expensive iterative inference schemes (such as MCMC) per datapoint. The learned approximate posterior inference model can also be used for a host of tasks such as recognition, denoising, representation and visualization purposes. When a neural network is used for the recognition model, we arrive at the variational auto-encoder. In this section we’ll give an example where we use a neural network for the probabilistic encoder q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) (the approximation to the posterior of the generative model p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})) and where the parameters \boldsymbol{\phi} and \boldsymbol{\theta} are optimized jointly with the AEVB algorithm. The AEVB algorithm exposes a connection between directed probabilistic models (trained with a variational objective) and auto-encoders. A connection between linear auto-encoders and a certain class of generative linear-Gaussian models has long been known. In  [Row98] it was shown that PCA corresponds to the maximum-likelihood (ML) solution of a special case of the linear-Gaussian model with a prior p(\mathbf{z})=\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}) and a conditional distribution p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{W}\mathbf{z},\epsilon\mathbf{I}), specifically the case with infinitesimally small \epsilon. We compared performance of AEVB to the wake-sleep algorithm [HDFN95]. We employed the same encoder (also called recognition model) for the wake-sleep algorithm and the variational auto-encoder. All parameters, both variational and generative, were initialized by random sampling from \mathcal{N}(0,0.01), and were jointly stochastically optimized using the MAP criterion. Stepsizes were adapted with Adagrad [DHS10]; the Adagrad global stepsize parameters were chosen from {0.01, 0.02, 0.1} based on performance on the training set in the first few iterations. Minibatches of size M=100 were used, with L=1 samples per datapoint.","The AEVB algorithm connects between directed probabilistic models

1476,What are the uses of approximate posterior inference of the latent variable z given an observed value x for parameters θ?,"Under certain mild conditions outlined in section 2.4 for a chosen approximate posterior q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) we can reparameterize the random variable \widetilde{\mathbf{z}}\sim q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) using a differentiable transformation g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{x}) of an (auxiliary) noise variable \boldsymbol{\epsilon}:\displaystyle\widetilde{\mathbf{z}}=g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{x})\text{\quad with \quad}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\sim p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})(4)See section 2.4 for general strategies for chosing such an approriate distribution p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}) and function g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{x}).We can now form Monte Carlo estimates of expectations of some function f(\mathbf{z}) w.r.t. q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) as follows:\displaystyle\mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})}\left[f(\mathbf{z})\right]=\mathbb{E}_{p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})}\left[f(g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{x}^{(i)}))\right]\displaystyle\simeq\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}{f(g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)},\mathbf{x}^{(i)}))}\text{\quad where \quad}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)}\sim p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})(5)We apply this technique to the variational lower bound (eq. (2)), yielding our generic Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) estimator \widetilde{\mathcal{L}}^{A}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\simeq\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)}):\displaystyle\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}^{A}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\displaystyle=\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)},\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)})-\log q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\displaystyle\text{where \quad}\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}\displaystyle=g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(i,l)},\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\text{\quad and \quad}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)}\sim p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})(6)Often, the KL-divergence DK⁢L(qϕ(𝐳|𝐱(i))||p𝜽(𝐳))D_{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})||p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}))italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z | bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) | | italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z ) ) of eq. (3) can be integrated analytically (see appendix B), such that only the expected reconstruction error \mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})}\left[\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}|\mathbf{z})\right] requires estimation by sampling.

In our experiments we found that the number of samples L per datapoint can be set to 1 as long as the minibatch size M was large enough, e.g. M=100. Derivatives \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}}\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}(\boldsymbol{\theta};\mathbf{X}^{M}) can be taken, and the resulting gradients can be used in conjunction with stochastic optimization methods such as SGD or Adagrad [DHS10]. See algorithm 1 for a basic approach to compute the stochastic gradients. Let the prior over the latent variables be the centered isotropic multivariate Gaussian p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}). Note that in this case, the prior lacks parameters. We let p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}) be a multivariate Gaussian (in case of real-valued data) or Bernoulli (in case of binary data) whose distribution parameters are computed from \mathbf{z} with a MLP (a fully-connected neural network with a single hidden layer, see appendix C). Note the true posterior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) is in this case intractable.While there is much freedom in the form q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}), we’ll assume the true (but intractable) posterior takes on a approximate Gaussian form with an approximately diagonal covariance. In this case, we can let the variational approximate posterior be a multivariate Gaussian with a diagonal covariance structure222Note that this is just a (simplifying) choice, and not a limitation of our method.:\displaystyle\log q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\displaystyle=\log\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{z};\boldsymbol{\mu}^{(i)},\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{2(i)}\mathbf{I})(9)where the mean and s.d. of the approximate posterior, \boldsymbol{\mu}^{(i)} and \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(i)}, are outputs of the encoding MLP, i.e. nonlinear functions of datapoint \mathbf{x}^{(i)} and the variational parameters \boldsymbol{\phi} (see appendix C). As explained in section 2.4, we sample from the posterior \mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}\sim q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) using \mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}=g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)},\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)})=\boldsymbol{\mu}^{(i)}+\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(i)}\odot\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)} where \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)}\sim\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}). With \odot we signify an element-wise product.In this model both p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}) (the prior) and q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) are Gaussian; in this case, we can use the estimator of eq. (7) where the KL divergence can be computed and differentiated without estimation (see appendix B). The resulting estimator for this model and datapoint \mathbf{x}^{(i)} is:\displaystyle\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\displaystyle\simeq\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\left(1+\log((\sigma_{j}^{(i)})^{2})-(\mu_{j}^{(i)})^{2}-(\sigma_{j}^{(i)})^{2}\right)+\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}|\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)})\displaystyle\text{where\quad}\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}\displaystyle=\boldsymbol{\mu}^{(i)}+\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(i)}\odot\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)}\text{\quad and \quad}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})(10)As explained above and in appendix C, the decoding term \log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}|\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}) is a Bernoulli or Gaussian MLP, depending on the type of data we are modelling. The strategy in this section can be used to derive a lower bound estimator (a stochastic objective function) for a variety of directed graphical models with continuous latent variables. We will restrict ourselves here to the common case where we have an i.i.d. dataset with latent variables per datapoint, and where we like to perform maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference on the (global) parameters, and variational inference on the latent variables. It is, for example, straightforward to extend this scenario to the case where we also perform variational inference on the global parameters; that algorithm is put in the appendix, but experiments with that case are left to future work. Note that our method can be applied to online, non-stationary settings, e.g. streaming data, but here we assume a fixed dataset for simplicity. Let us consider some dataset \mathbf{X}=\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{N} consisting of N i.i.d. samples of some continuous or discrete variable \mathbf{x}. We assume that the data are generated by some random process, involving an unobserved continuous random variable \mathbf{z}. The process consists of two steps: (1) a value \mathbf{z}^{(i)} is generated from some prior distribution p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}}(\mathbf{z}); (2) a value \mathbf{x}^{(i)} is generated from some conditional distribution p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}). We assume that the prior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}}(\mathbf{z}) and likelihood p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}) come from parametric families of distributions p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}) and p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}), and that their PDFs are differentiable almost everywhere w.r.t. both \boldsymbol{\theta} and \mathbf{z}. Unfortunately, a lot of this process is hidden from our view: the true parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}^{*} as well as the values of the latent variables \mathbf{z}^{(i)} are unknown to us. We are interested in, and propose a solution to, three related problems in the above scenario:1.Efficient approximate ML or MAP estimation for the parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}. The parameters can be of interest themselves, e.g. if we are analyzing some natural process. They also allow us to mimic the hidden random process and generate artificial data that resembles the real data.2.Efficient approximate posterior inference of the latent variable \mathbf{z} given an observed value \mathbf{x} for a choice of parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}. This is useful for coding or data representation tasks.3.Efficient approximate marginal inference of the variable \mathbf{x}. This allows us to perform all kinds of inference tasks where a prior over \mathbf{x} is required. Common applications in computer vision include image denoising, inpainting and super-resolution. For the purpose of solving the above problems, let us introduce a recognition model q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}): an approximation to the intractable true posterior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}). Note that in contrast with the approximate posterior in mean-field variational inference, it is not necessarily factorial and its parameters \boldsymbol{\phi} are not computed from some closed-form expectation. Instead, we’ll introduce a method for learning the recognition model parameters \boldsymbol{\phi} jointly with the generative model parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}.

In this section we introduce a practical estimator of the lower bound and its derivatives w.r.t. the parameters. We assume an approximate posterior in the form q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}), but please note that the technique can be applied to the case q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}), i.e. where we do not condition on \mathbf{x}, as well.

Low-pass filter data refers to the output of a low-pass filter applied to an image. In the context of image processing, a low-pass filter is a mathematical operation that smooths out the image, retaining only the large-scale features and suppressing the high-frequency details. The low-pass filter output is a representation of the image that emphasizes the larger, more gradual changes in the image, rather than the small, detailed features. In the context of inversion, conditioning the denoising process on noised low-pass filter data from the target image helps to preserve the large-scale features of the original image, while still allowing for some degree of detail to be recovered",0.1783439441032092,0.0272727223061992,0.1401273835936551,0.9262007088220838,30.81578384707576,27.016988094227745,0.093813387423935,0.0099869735128093,0.1702480167150497,0.5342135611344079,0.2051989320665598,0.5098439455032349,0.0290467303710338,0.5,0.7478402048546576,0.7648685101194802
1477,What is used as a recognition model in variational auto encoder?,"For the case of an i.i.d. dataset and continuous latent variables per datapoint, we propose the Auto-Encoding VB (AEVB) algorithm. In the AEVB algorithm we make inference and learning especially efficient by using the SGVB estimator to optimize a recognition model that allows us to perform very efficient approximate posterior inference using simple ancestral sampling, which in turn allows us to efficiently learn the model parameters, without the need of expensive iterative inference schemes (such as MCMC) per datapoint. The learned approximate posterior inference model can also be used for a host of tasks such as recognition, denoising, representation and visualization purposes. When a neural network is used for the recognition model, we arrive at the variational auto-encoder. The AEVB algorithm exposes a connection between directed probabilistic models (trained with a variational objective) and auto-encoders. A connection between linear auto-encoders and a certain class of generative linear-Gaussian models has long been known. In  [Row98] it was shown that PCA corresponds to the maximum-likelihood (ML) solution of a special case of the linear-Gaussian model with a prior p(\mathbf{z})=\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}) and a conditional distribution p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{W}\mathbf{z},\epsilon\mathbf{I}), specifically the case with infinitesimally small \epsilon. The generative model (encoder) and variational approximation (decoder) from section 3 were used, where the described encoder and decoder have an equal number of hidden units. Since the Frey Face data are continuous, we used a decoder with Gaussian outputs, identical to the encoder, except that the means were constrained to the interval (0,1) using a sigmoidal activation function at the decoder output.Note that with hidden units we refer to the hidden layer of the neural networks of the encoder and decoder. We compared performance of AEVB to the wake-sleep algorithm [HDFN95]. We employed the same encoder (also called recognition model) for the wake-sleep algorithm and the variational auto-encoder. All parameters, both variational and generative, were initialized by random sampling from \mathcal{N}(0,0.01), and were jointly stochastically optimized using the MAP criterion. Stepsizes were adapted with Adagrad [DHS10]; the Adagrad global stepsize parameters were chosen from {0.01, 0.02, 0.1} based on performance on the training set in the first few iterations. Minibatches of size M=100 were used, with L=1 samples per datapoint. For the purpose of solving the above problems, let us introduce a recognition model q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}): an approximation to the intractable true posterior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}).

1479,What’s the effect of the gradient of the lower bound w.r.t. φ on the naïve Monte Carlo estimator?,"Under certain mild conditions outlined in section 2.4 for a chosen approximate posterior q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) we can reparameterize the random variable \widetilde{\mathbf{z}}\sim q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) using a differentiable transformation g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{x}) of an (auxiliary) noise variable \boldsymbol{\epsilon}:\displaystyle\widetilde{\mathbf{z}}=g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{x})\text{\quad with \quad}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\sim p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})(4)See section 2.4 for general strategies for chosing such an approriate distribution p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}) and function g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{x}).We can now form Monte Carlo estimates of expectations of some function f(\mathbf{z}) w.r.t. q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) as follows:\displaystyle\mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})}\left[f(\mathbf{z})\right]=\mathbb{E}_{p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})}\left[f(g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{x}^{(i)}))\right]\displaystyle\simeq\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}{f(g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)},\mathbf{x}^{(i)}))}\text{\quad where \quad}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)}\sim p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})(5)We apply this technique to the variational lower bound (eq. (2)), yielding our generic Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) estimator \widetilde{\mathcal{L}}^{A}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\simeq\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)}):\displaystyle\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}^{A}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\displaystyle=\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)},\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)})-\log q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\displaystyle\text{where \quad}\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}\displaystyle=g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(i,l)},\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\text{\quad and \quad}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)}\sim p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})(6)Often, the KL-divergence DK⁢L(qϕ(𝐳|𝐱(i))||p𝜽(𝐳))D_{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})||p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}))italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z | bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) | | italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z ) ) of eq. (3) can be integrated analytically (see appendix B), such that only the expected reconstruction error \mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})}\left[\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}|\mathbf{z})\right] requires estimation by sampling. The KL-divergence term can then be interpreted as regularizing \boldsymbol{\phi}, encouraging the approximate posterior to be close to the prior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}).This yields a second version of the SGVB estimator \widetilde{\mathcal{L}}^{B}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\simeq\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), corresponding to eq. (3), which typically has less variance than the generic estimator:\displaystyle\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}^{B}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})=−DK⁢L(qϕ(𝐳|𝐱(i))||p𝜽(𝐳))+1L∑l=1L(logp𝜽(𝐱(i)|𝐳(i,l)))\displaystyle=-D_{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})||p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}))+\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}(\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}|\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}))= - italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z | bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) | | italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z ) ) + divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_L end_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_log italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT | bold_z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i , italic_l ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) )\displaystyle\text{where \quad}\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}\displaystyle=g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(i,l)},\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\text{\quad and \quad}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)}\sim p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})(7)Given multiple datapoints from a dataset \mathbf{X} with N datapoints, we can construct an estimator of the marginal likelihood lower bound of the full dataset, based on minibatches:\displaystyle\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{X})\simeq\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}^{M}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{X}^{M})=\frac{N}{M}\sum_{i=1}^{M}\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})(8)where the minibatch \mathbf{X}^{M}=\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{M} is a randomly drawn sample of M datapoints from the full dataset \mathbf{X} with N datapoints. In our experiments we found that the number of samples L per datapoint can be set to 1 as long as the minibatch size M was large enough, e.g. M=100. Derivatives \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}}\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}(\boldsymbol{\theta};\mathbf{X}^{M}) can be taken, and the resulting gradients can be used in conjunction with stochastic optimization methods such as SGD or Adagrad [DHS10]. See algorithm 1 for a basic approach to compute the stochastic gradients. This reparameterization is useful for our case since it can be used to rewrite an expectation w.r.t q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) such that the Monte Carlo estimate of the expectation is differentiable w.r.t. \boldsymbol{\phi}. A proof is as follows. Given the deterministic mapping \mathbf{z}=g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{x}) we know that q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})\prod_{i}dz_{i}=p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})\prod_{i}d\epsilon_{i}. Therefore111Note that for infinitesimals we use the notational convention d\mathbf{z}=\prod_{i}dz_{i}, \int q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})f(\mathbf{z})\,d\mathbf{z}=\int p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})f(\mathbf{z})\,d\boldsymbol{\epsilon}=\int p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})f(g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{x}))\,d\boldsymbol{\epsilon}. It follows that a differentiable estimator can be constructed: \int q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})f(\mathbf{z})\,d\mathbf{z}\simeq\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}f(g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)})) where \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)}\sim p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}). In section 2.3 we applied this trick to obtain a differentiable estimator of the variational lower bound. The strategy in this section can be used to derive a lower bound estimator (a stochastic objective function) for a variety of directed graphical models with continuous latent variables. We will restrict ourselves here to the common case where we have an i.i.d. dataset with latent variables per datapoint, and where we like to perform maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference on the (global) parameters, and variational inference on the latent variables. It is, for example, straightforward to extend this scenario to the case where we also perform variational inference on the global parameters; that algorithm is put in the appendix, but experiments with that case are left to future work. Note that our method can be applied to online, non-stationary settings, e.g. streaming data, but here we assume a fixed dataset for simplicity. Stochastic variational inference [HBWP13] has recently received increasing interest. Recently, [BJP12] introduced a control variate schemes to reduce the high variance of the naïve gradient estimator discussed in section 2.1, and applied to exponential family approximations of the posterior. In [RGB13] some general methods, i.e. a control variate scheme, were introduced for reducing the variance of the original gradient estimator. In [SK13], a similar reparameterization as in this paper was used in an efficient version of a stochastic variational inference algorithm for learning the natural parameters of exponential-family approximating distributions. Parameters are updated using stochastic gradient ascent where gradients are computed by differentiating the lower bound estimator \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}}\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{X}) (see algorithm  1), plus a small weight decay term corresponding to a prior p(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}). Optimization of this objective is equivalent to approximate MAP estimation, where the likelihood gradient is approximated by the gradient of the lower bound. The marginal likelihood is composed of a sum over the marginal likelihoods of individual datapoints \log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(1)},\cdots,\mathbf{x}^{(N)})=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), which can each be rewritten as:logp𝜽(𝐱(i))=DK⁢L(qϕ(𝐳|𝐱(i))||p𝜽(𝐳|𝐱(i)))+ℒ(𝜽,ϕ;𝐱(i))\displaystyle\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})=D_{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})||p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)}))+\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})roman_log italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) = italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z | bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) | | italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z | bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) ) + caligraphic_L ( bold_italic_θ , bold_italic_ϕ ; bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )(1)The first RHS term is the KL divergence of the approximate from the true posterior. Since this KL-divergence is non-negative, the second RHS term \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) is called the (variational) lower bound on the marginal likelihood of datapoint i, and can be written as:\displaystyle\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\geq\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\displaystyle=\mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}\left[-\log q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})+\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\right](2)which can also be written as:ℒ(𝜽,ϕ;𝐱(i))=−DK⁢L(qϕ(𝐳|𝐱(i))||p𝜽(𝐳))+𝔼qϕ⁢(𝐳|𝐱(i))[logp𝜽(𝐱(i)|𝐳)]\displaystyle\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})=-D_{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})||p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}))+\mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})}\left[\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}|\mathbf{z})\right]caligraphic_L ( bold_italic_θ , bold_italic_ϕ ; bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) = - italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z | bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) | | italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z ) ) + blackboard_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z | bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [ roman_log italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT | bold_z ) ](3)We want to differentiate and optimize the lower bound \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) w.r.t. both the variational parameters \boldsymbol{\phi} and generative parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}.

1480,How to obtain SGVB estimator from variational lower bound?,"How can we perform efficient approximate inference and learning with directed probabilistic modelswhose continuous latent variables and/or parameters have intractable posterior distributions?The variational Bayesian (VB) approach involves the optimization of an approximation to the intractable posterior.

The KL-divergence term can then be interpreted as regularizing \boldsymbol{\phi}, encouraging the approximate posterior to be close to the prior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}).This yields a second version of the SGVB estimator \widetilde{\mathcal{L}}^{B}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\simeq\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), corresponding to eq. (3), which typically has less variance than the generic estimator:\displaystyle\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}^{B}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})=−DK⁢L(qϕ(𝐳|𝐱(i))||p𝜽(𝐳))+1L∑l=1L(logp𝜽(𝐱(i)|𝐳(i,l)))\displaystyle=-D_{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})||p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}))+\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}(\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}|\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}))= - italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z | bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) | | italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z ) ) + divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_L end_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_log italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT | bold_z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i , italic_l ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) )\displaystyle\text{where \quad}\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}\displaystyle=g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(i,l)},\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\text{\quad and \quad}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)}\sim p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})(7)Given multiple datapoints from a dataset \mathbf{X} with N datapoints, we can construct an estimator of the marginal likelihood lower bound of the full dataset, based on minibatches:\displaystyle\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{X})\simeq\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}^{M}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{X}^{M})=\frac{N}{M}\sum_{i=1}^{M}\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})(8)where the minibatch \mathbf{X}^{M}=\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{M} is a randomly drawn sample of M datapoints from the full dataset \mathbf{X} with N datapoints. In our experiments we found that the number of samples L per datapoint can be set to 1 as long as the minibatch size M was large enough, e.g. M=100. Derivatives \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}}\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}(\boldsymbol{\theta};\mathbf{X}^{M}) can be taken, and the resulting gradients can be used in conjunction with stochastic optimization methods such as SGD or Adagrad [DHS10]. See algorithm 1 for a basic approach to compute the stochastic gradients. The strategy in this section can be used to derive a lower bound estimator (a stochastic objective function) for a variety of directed graphical models with continuous latent variables. We will restrict ourselves here to the common case where we have an i.i.d. dataset with latent variables per datapoint, and where we like to perform maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference on the (global) parameters, and variational inference on the latent variables. It is, for example, straightforward to extend this scenario to the case where we also perform variational inference on the global parameters; that algorithm is put in the appendix, but experiments with that case are left to future work. Note that our method can be applied to online, non-stationary settings, e.g. streaming data, but here we assume a fixed dataset for simplicity. Stochastic variational inference [HBWP13] has recently received increasing interest. Recently, [BJP12] introduced a control variate schemes to reduce the high variance of the naïve gradient estimator discussed in section 2.1, and applied to exponential family approximations of the posterior. In [RGB13] some general methods, i.e. a control variate scheme, were introduced for reducing the variance of the original gradient estimator. In [SK13], a similar reparameterization as in this paper was used in an efficient version of a stochastic variational inference algorithm for learning the natural parameters of exponential-family approximating distributions. Parameters are updated using stochastic gradient ascent where gradients are computed by differentiating the lower bound estimator \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}}\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{X}) (see algorithm  1), plus a small weight decay term corresponding to a prior p(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}). Optimization of this objective is equivalent to approximate MAP estimation, where the likelihood gradient is approximated by the gradient of the lower bound. We have introduced a novel estimator of the variational lower bound, Stochastic Gradient VB (SGVB), for efficient approximate inference with continuous latent variables. The proposed estimator can be straightforwardly differentiated and optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. For the case of i.i.d. datasets and continuous latent variables per datapoint we introduce an efficient algorithm for efficient inference and learning, Auto-Encoding VB (AEVB), that learns an approximate inference model using the SGVB estimator. The theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.","Authors apply Monte Carlo estimates of expectations of some function f(\mathbf{z}) w.r.t. q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) to the variational lower bound (eq. (2)), yielding generic Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) estimator. The KL-diverdnence in eq. (3) can be integrated, such that only the reconstruction error requires estimation by sampling. The KL-divergence term regularizes \phi, encouraging the approximate posterior to be close to the prior p_\theta(z) yielding a SGVB estimator. Parameters are updated using stochastic gradient ascent where gradients are computed by differentiating the lower bound estimator.","The authors achieved state-of-the-art FID values on ImageNet using their improved diffusion model, with the best FID values obtained on the 256x256 and 512x512 resolutions",0.066666663088889,0.0,0.066666663088889,0.378998288567802,19.40388938174396,16.100091521934303,0.0258620689655172,0.0031152647975077,0.1322658061981201,0.4806735102846657,0.1478274315595626,0.2751853764057159,0.008374146433292,0.0,0.7112814705876525,0.757396385656874

We employed the same encoder (also called recognition model) for the wake-sleep algorithm and the variational auto-encoder. All parameters, both variational and generative, were initialized by random sampling from \mathcal{N}(0,0.01), and were jointly stochastically optimized using the MAP criterion.

Minibatches of size M=100 were used, with L=1 samples per datapoint.

1485,What do we mean by hidden units?,"In relevant recent work on autoencoders [VLL{}^{+}10] it was shown that the training criterion of unregularized autoencoders corresponds to maximization of a lower bound (see the infomax principle [Lin89]) of the mutual information between input X and latent representation Z. Maximizing (w.r.t. parameters) of the mutual information is equivalent to maximizing the conditional entropy, which is lower bounded by the expected loglikelihood of the data under the autoencoding model [VLL{}^{+}10], i.e. the negative reconstrution error.However, it is well known that this reconstruction criterion is in itself not sufficient for learning useful representations [BCV13].Regularization techniques have been proposed to make autoencoders learn useful representations, such as denoising, contractive and sparse autoencoder variants  [BCV13]. The SGVB objective contains a regularization term dictated by the variational bound (e.g. eq. (10)), lacking the usual nuisance regularization hyperparameter required to learn useful representations.Related are also encoder-decoder architectures such as the predictive sparse decomposition (PSD) [KRL08], from which we drew some inspiration. Also relevant are the recently introduced Generative Stochastic Networks [BTL13] where noisy auto-encoders learn the transition operator of a Markov chain that samples from the data distribution. In [SL10] a recognition model was employed for efficient learning with Deep Boltzmann Machines.These methods are targeted at either unnormalized models (i.e. undirected models like Boltzmann machines) or limited to sparse coding models, in contrast to our proposed algorithm for learning a general class of directed probabilistic models. The generative model (encoder) and variational approximation (decoder) from section 3 were used, where the described encoder and decoder have an equal number of hidden units. Since the Frey Face data are continuous, we used a decoder with Gaussian outputs, identical to the encoder, except that the means were constrained to the interval (0,1) using a sigmoidal activation function at the decoder output.Note that with hidden units we refer to the hidden layer of the neural networks of the encoder and decoder. We trained generative models (decoders) and corresponding encoders (a.k.a. recognition models) having 500 hidden units in case of MNIST, and 200 hidden units in case of the Frey Face dataset (to prevent overfitting, since it is a considerably smaller dataset). The chosen number of hidden units is based on prior literature on auto-encoders, and the relative performance of different algorithms was not very sensitive to these choices. Figure 2 shows the results when comparing the lower bounds. Interestingly, superfluous latent variables did not result in overfitting, which is explained by the regularizing nature of the variational bound. For very low-dimensional latent space it is possible to estimate the marginal likelihood of the learned generative models using an MCMC estimator.

The KL-divergence term can then be interpreted as regularizing \boldsymbol{\phi}, encouraging the approximate posterior to be close to the prior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}).This yields a second version of the SGVB estimator \widetilde{\mathcal{L}}^{B}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\simeq\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), corresponding to eq. (3), which typically has less variance than the generic estimator:\displaystyle\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}^{B}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})=−DK⁢L(qϕ(𝐳|𝐱(i))||p𝜽(𝐳))+1L∑l=1L(logp𝜽(𝐱(i)|𝐳(i,l)))\displaystyle=-D_{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})||p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}))+\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}(\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}|\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}))= - italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z | bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) | | italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z ) ) + divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_L end_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_log italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT | bold_z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i , italic_l ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) )\displaystyle\text{where \quad}\mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}\displaystyle=g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(i,l)},\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\text{\quad and \quad}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)}\sim p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})(7)Given multiple datapoints from a dataset \mathbf{X} with N datapoints, we can construct an estimator of the marginal likelihood lower bound of the full dataset, based on minibatches:\displaystyle\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{X})\simeq\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}^{M}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{X}^{M})=\frac{N}{M}\sum_{i=1}^{M}\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{x}^{(i)})(8)where the minibatch \mathbf{X}^{M}=\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{M} is a randomly drawn sample of M datapoints from the full dataset \mathbf{X} with N datapoints. In our experiments we found that the number of samples L per datapoint can be set to 1 as long as the minibatch size M was large enough, e.g. M=100. Derivatives \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}}\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}(\boldsymbol{\theta};\mathbf{X}^{M}) can be taken, and the resulting gradients can be used in conjunction with stochastic optimization methods such as SGD or Adagrad [DHS10]. See algorithm 1 for a basic approach to compute the stochastic gradients. Parameters are updated using stochastic gradient ascent where gradients are computed by differentiating the lower bound estimator \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}}\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{X}) (see algorithm  1), plus a small weight decay term corresponding to a prior p(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}). Optimization of this objective is equivalent to approximate MAP estimation, where the likelihood gradient is approximated by the gradient of the lower bound. We compared performance of AEVB to the wake-sleep algorithm [HDFN95]. We employed the same encoder (also called recognition model) for the wake-sleep algorithm and the variational auto-encoder. All parameters, both variational and generative, were initialized by random sampling from \mathcal{N}(0,0.01), and were jointly stochastically optimized using the MAP criterion. Stepsizes were adapted with Adagrad [DHS10]; the Adagrad global stepsize parameters were chosen from {0.01, 0.02, 0.1} based on performance on the training set in the first few iterations. Minibatches of size M=100 were used, with L=1 samples per datapoint. We have introduced a novel estimator of the variational lower bound, Stochastic Gradient VB (SGVB), for efficient approximate inference with continuous latent variables. The proposed estimator can be straightforwardly differentiated and optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. For the case of i.i.d. datasets and continuous latent variables per datapoint we introduce an efficient algorithm for efficient inference and learning, Auto-Encoding VB (AEVB), that learns an approximate inference model using the SGVB estimator. The theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.","Authors form Monte Carlo estimates of expectations of some function f(\mathbf{z}) w.r.t. q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) as Eq.

1487,Sometimes the posterior distribution is intractable in nature. What do we mean by intractable?,"How can we perform efficient approximate inference and learning with directed probabilistic modelswhose continuous latent variables and/or parameters have intractable posterior distributions?The variational Bayesian (VB) approach involves the optimization of an approximation to the intractable posterior. Unfortunately, the common mean-field approach requires analytical solutions of expectations w.r.t. the approximate posterior, which are also intractable in the general case. We show how a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a simple differentiable unbiased estimator of the lower bound; this SGVB (Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes) estimator can be used for efficient approximate posterior inference in almost any model with continuous latent variables and/or parameters, and is straightforward to optimize using standard stochastic gradient ascent techniques. Let the prior over the latent variables be the centered isotropic multivariate Gaussian p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}). Note that in this case, the prior lacks parameters. We let p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}) be a multivariate Gaussian (in case of real-valued data) or Bernoulli (in case of binary data) whose distribution parameters are computed from \mathbf{z} with a MLP (a fully-connected neural network with a single hidden layer, see appendix C). Note the true posterior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) is in this case intractable.While there is much freedom in the form q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}), we’ll assume the true (but intractable) posterior takes on a approximate Gaussian form with an approximately diagonal covariance. In this case, we can let the variational approximate posterior be a multivariate Gaussian with a diagonal covariance structure222Note that this is just a (simplifying) choice, and not a limitation of our method.:\displaystyle\log q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\displaystyle=\log\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{z};\boldsymbol{\mu}^{(i)},\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{2(i)}\mathbf{I})(9)where the mean and s.d. of the approximate posterior, \boldsymbol{\mu}^{(i)} and \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(i)}, are outputs of the encoding MLP, i.e. nonlinear functions of datapoint \mathbf{x}^{(i)} and the variational parameters \boldsymbol{\phi} (see appendix C). The strategy in this section can be used to derive a lower bound estimator (a stochastic objective function) for a variety of directed graphical models with continuous latent variables. We will restrict ourselves here to the common case where we have an i.i.d. dataset with latent variables per datapoint, and where we like to perform maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference on the (global) parameters, and variational inference on the latent variables. It is, for example, straightforward to extend this scenario to the case where we also perform variational inference on the global parameters; that algorithm is put in the appendix, but experiments with that case are left to future work. Note that our method can be applied to online, non-stationary settings, e.g. streaming data, but here we assume a fixed dataset for simplicity. Let us consider some dataset \mathbf{X}=\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{N} consisting of N i.i.d. samples of some continuous or discrete variable \mathbf{x}. We assume that the data are generated by some random process, involving an unobserved continuous random variable \mathbf{z}. The process consists of two steps: (1) a value \mathbf{z}^{(i)} is generated from some prior distribution p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}}(\mathbf{z}); (2) a value \mathbf{x}^{(i)} is generated from some conditional distribution p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}). We assume that the prior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}}(\mathbf{z}) and likelihood p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}) come from parametric families of distributions p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}) and p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}), and that their PDFs are differentiable almost everywhere w.r.t. both \boldsymbol{\theta} and \mathbf{z}. Unfortunately, a lot of this process is hidden from our view: the true parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}^{*} as well as the values of the latent variables \mathbf{z}^{(i)} are unknown to us. We are interested in, and propose a solution to, three related problems in the above scenario:1.Efficient approximate ML or MAP estimation for the parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}. The parameters can be of interest themselves, e.g. if we are analyzing some natural process. They also allow us to mimic the hidden random process and generate artificial data that resembles the real data.2.Efficient approximate posterior inference of the latent variable \mathbf{z} given an observed value \mathbf{x} for a choice of parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}. This is useful for coding or data representation tasks.3.Efficient approximate marginal inference of the variable \mathbf{x}. This allows us to perform all kinds of inference tasks where a prior over \mathbf{x} is required. Common applications in computer vision include image denoising, inpainting and super-resolution. For the purpose of solving the above problems, let us introduce a recognition model q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}): an approximation to the intractable true posterior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}). Note that in contrast with the approximate posterior in mean-field variational inference, it is not necessarily factorial and its parameters \boldsymbol{\phi} are not computed from some closed-form expectation. Instead, we’ll introduce a method for learning the recognition model parameters \boldsymbol{\phi} jointly with the generative model parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}.","In this paper, authors want to solve several inference tasks including image denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution by approximating marginal inference of the variable \mathbf{x}. To solve these problems, they introduce a recognition model q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}): an approximation to the intractable true posterior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}). The posterior distribution is intractable, thus in this paper, authors introduce the stragegy that can be used to derive a lower bound estimator (a stochastic objective function) for a variety of directed graphical models with continuous latent variables.","The confusion matrix Q in the authors' noisy label robustness experiment refers to a matrix that represents the predicted labels of the model against the true labels of the dataset, where the true labels are corrupted with noise",0.2127659532639203,0.0181818139818191,0.1914893575192395,0.8304698876286366,25.834561001341843,23.401631331640328,0.0795283442519019,0.0052500690798563,0.1667220741510391,0.5589571116694395,0.2159532010555267,0.4977897703647613,0.0071057818224689,0.5,0.7669371761630623,0.8089060727592129
1488,Is the computational complexity per data point of wake sleep algorithm same as AEVB or is it different?,"The wake-sleep algorithm [HDFN95] is, to the best of our knowledge, the only other on-line learning method in the literature that is applicable to the same general class of continuous latent variable models. Like our method, the wake-sleep algorithm employs a recognition model that approximates the true posterior. A drawback of the wake-sleep algorithm is that it requires a concurrent optimization of two objective functions, which together do not correspond to optimization of (a bound of) the marginal likelihood.An advantage of wake-sleep is that it also applies to models with discrete latent variables. Wake-Sleep has the same computational complexity as AEVB per datapoint. We compared performance of AEVB to the wake-sleep algorithm [HDFN95].

See algorithm 1 for a basic approach to compute the stochastic gradients. This reparameterization is useful for our case since it can be used to rewrite an expectation w.r.t q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) such that the Monte Carlo estimate of the expectation is differentiable w.r.t. \boldsymbol{\phi}. A proof is as follows. Given the deterministic mapping \mathbf{z}=g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{x}) we know that q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})\prod_{i}dz_{i}=p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})\prod_{i}d\epsilon_{i}. Therefore111Note that for infinitesimals we use the notational convention d\mathbf{z}=\prod_{i}dz_{i}, \int q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})f(\mathbf{z})\,d\mathbf{z}=\int p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})f(\mathbf{z})\,d\boldsymbol{\epsilon}=\int p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})f(g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{x}))\,d\boldsymbol{\epsilon}. It follows that a differentiable estimator can be constructed: \int q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})f(\mathbf{z})\,d\mathbf{z}\simeq\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}f(g_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)})) where \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(l)}\sim p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}). In section 2.3 we applied this trick to obtain a differentiable estimator of the variational lower bound.

Parameters are updated using stochastic gradient ascent where gradients are computed by differentiating the lower bound estimator \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}}\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi};\mathbf{X}) (see algorithm  1), plus a small weight decay term corresponding to a prior p(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}). Optimization of this objective is equivalent to approximate MAP estimation, where the likelihood gradient is approximated by the gradient of the lower bound. Let us consider some dataset \mathbf{X}=\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{N} consisting of N i.i.d. samples of some continuous or discrete variable \mathbf{x}. We assume that the data are generated by some random process, involving an unobserved continuous random variable \mathbf{z}. The process consists of two steps: (1) a value \mathbf{z}^{(i)} is generated from some prior distribution p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}}(\mathbf{z}); (2) a value \mathbf{x}^{(i)} is generated from some conditional distribution p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}). We assume that the prior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}}(\mathbf{z}) and likelihood p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}) come from parametric families of distributions p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}) and p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}), and that their PDFs are differentiable almost everywhere w.r.t. both \boldsymbol{\theta} and \mathbf{z}. Unfortunately, a lot of this process is hidden from our view: the true parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}^{*} as well as the values of the latent variables \mathbf{z}^{(i)} are unknown to us. Very importantly, we do not make the common simplifying assumptions about the marginal or posterior probabilities. Conversely, we are here interested in a general algorithm that even works efficiently in the case of:1.Intractability: the case where the integral of the marginal likelihood p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})=\int p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})\,d\mathbf{z} is intractable (so we cannot evaluate or differentiate the marginal likelihood), where the true posterior density p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})=p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})/p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}) is intractable (so the EM algorithm cannot be used), and where the required integrals for any reasonable mean-field VB algorithm are also intractable. These intractabilities are quite common and appear in cases of moderately complicated likelihood functions p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}), e.g. a neural network with a nonlinear hidden layer.2.A large dataset: we have so much data that batch optimization is too costly; we would like to make parameter updates using small minibatches or even single datapoints. Sampling-based solutions, e.g. Monte Carlo EM, would in general be too slow, since it involves a typically expensive sampling loop per datapoint. We are interested in, and propose a solution to, three related problems in the above scenario:1.Efficient approximate ML or MAP estimation for the parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}. The parameters can be of interest themselves, e.g. if we are analyzing some natural process. They also allow us to mimic the hidden random process and generate artificial data that resembles the real data.2.Efficient approximate posterior inference of the latent variable \mathbf{z} given an observed value \mathbf{x} for a choice of parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}. This is useful for coding or data representation tasks.3.Efficient approximate marginal inference of the variable \mathbf{x}. This allows us to perform all kinds of inference tasks where a prior over \mathbf{x} is required. Common applications in computer vision include image denoising, inpainting and super-resolution. For the purpose of solving the above problems, let us introduce a recognition model q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}): an approximation to the intractable true posterior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}). Note that in contrast with the approximate posterior in mean-field variational inference, it is not necessarily factorial and its parameters \boldsymbol{\phi} are not computed from some closed-form expectation. Instead, we’ll introduce a method for learning the recognition model parameters \boldsymbol{\phi} jointly with the generative model parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}. In this section we introduce a practical estimator of the lower bound and its derivatives w.r.t. the parameters. We assume an approximate posterior in the form q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}), but please note that the technique can be applied to the case q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}), i.e. where we do not condition on \mathbf{x}, as well. The fully variational Bayesian method for inferring a posterior over the parameters is given in the appendix.",Authors introduce a practical estimator of the lower bound and its derivatives w.r.t. the parameters. They introduce a recognition model q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}): an approximation to the intractable true posterior p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}).

The chosen number of hidden units is based on prior literature on auto-encoders, and the relative performance of different algorithms was not very sensitive to these choices. Figure 2 shows the results when comparing the lower bounds. Interestingly, superfluous latent variables did not result in overfitting, which is explained by the regularizing nature of the variational bound. For very low-dimensional latent space it is possible to estimate the marginal likelihood of the learned generative models using an MCMC estimator.

1493,How is the conditioning vector obtained?,"Diffusion models are probabilistic generative models that are trained to learn a data distribution by the gradual denoising of a variable sampled from a Gaussian distribution. Specifically, this corresponds to learning the reverse process of a fixed-length Markovian forward process. In simple terms, a conditional diffusion model \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\theta} is trained using a squared error loss to denoise a variably-noised image \mathbf{z}_{t}\coloneqq\alpha_{t}\mathbf{x}+\sigma_{t}{\bm{\epsilon}} as follows:\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{c},{\bm{\epsilon}},t}\!\left[w_{t}\|\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\theta}(\alpha_{t}\mathbf{x}+\sigma_{t}{\bm{\epsilon}},\mathbf{c})-\mathbf{x}\|^{2}_{2}\right](1)where \mathbf{x} is the ground-truth image, \mathbf{c} is a conditioning vector (e.g., obtained from a text prompt), {\bm{\epsilon}}\sim\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}) is a noise term and \alpha_{t},\sigma_{t},w_{t} are terms that control the noise schedule and sample quality, and are functions of the diffusion process time t\sim\mathcal{U}([0,1]).At inference time, the diffusion model is sampled by iteratively denoising \mathbf{z}_{t_{1}}\sim\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}) using either the deterministic DDIM song2020denoising  or the stochastic ancestral sampler ho2020denoising . Intermediate points \mathbf{z}_{t_{1}},\dotsc,\mathbf{z}_{t_{T}}, where 1=t_{1}>\cdots>t_{T}=0, are generated, with decreasing noise levels. These points, \hat{\mathbf{x}}^{t}_{0}\coloneqq\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{c}), are functions of the \mathbf{x}-predictions. The details of text-conditioning in text-to-image diffusion models are of high importance for visual quality and semantic fidelity.

We often find that these tokens incur the same weaknesses as using common English words to index the subject.","Theoretically, concatenating random characters to create an unique identifier has weak prior in both the language model and the diffusion model. However, in practice, it has strong prior since the model tokenizes each letter independently, which increases training and reduces performance.","By using an r_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) that sets any pixels with small norm to zero, based on a threshold \theta_{\mathrm{n\_pct}} specified as a percentile of all pixel norms in \mathbf{x}",0.0999999950500002,0.0,0.066666661716667,0.8885598859379381,20.3050205081672,16.65869634834052,0.0425531914893617,0.0069513406156901,-0.0449373200535774,0.2926539427011979,0.0029072668403387,0.3780049681663513,0.0040183119123638,1.0,0.8300544251986254,0.7189408603342078
1500,How to create rare token identifier?,"In a nutshell, our approach is to find relatively rare tokens in the vocabulary, and then invert these rare tokens into text space. In order to do this, we first perform a rare-token lookup in the vocabulary and obtain a sequence of rare token identifiers f(\hat{\mathbf{V}}), where f is a tokenizer; a function that maps character sequences to tokens and \hat{\mathbf{V}} is the decoded text stemming from the tokens f(\hat{\mathbf{V}}). This sequence can be of variable length k with k being a hyperparameter of our method. We find that relatively short sequences of k=\{1,...,3\} work well. Then, by inverting the vocabulary using the de-tokenizer on f(\hat{\mathbf{V}}) we obtain a sequence of characters that define our unique identifier \hat{\mathbf{V}}. We observe that using uniform random sampling without replacement of tokens that correspond to 3 or fewer Unicode characters (without spaces) and using tokens in the T5-XXL tokenizer range of \{5000,...,10000\} works well.","In order to get a list of rare token IDs, we first search for rare tokens in the vocabulary. The de-tokenizer is then used to invert the vocabulary, resulting in a string of characters that serves as our rare-token identifier.",A balanced mixture of KG-specific QA datasets,0.0487804849732303,0.0,0.0487804849732303,0.8321783954793125,11.23383610015464,9.306992631828184,0.0248138957816377,0.0018387181507748,0.0860905721783638,0.2546834290134822,0.1137711107730865,0.2398251295089721,0.0009401389272141,,0.8310773691841035,0.710875267375898
1501,How to deal with overfitting due to small input set while fine tuning the text-to-img model?,"Since our input image set is quite small, fine-tuning the large image generation models can overfit to both the context and the appearance of the subject in the given input images (e.g., subject pose).Figure 12 (top) shows some sample generated images with naive fine-tuning where we clearly see that both the subject dog’s appearance and context are overfitted to those in the input images.There are many techniques that can be used to address these problems, such as regularization or selectively fine-tuning certain parts of the model. There is uncertainty on which parts of the model need to be frozen to both obtain good subject fidelity and semantic modification flexibility. In our experience, the best results that achieve maximum subject fidelity are achieved by fine-tuning all layers of the model. Nevertheless, this includes fine-tuning layers that are conditioned on the text embeddings, which gives rise to the problem of language drift.","For small input sets, Fine-tuning  large image generation models can overfit context and subject appearance. Regularization or selective model fine-tuning can solve these issues.

1502,What is language drift and how to deal with it?,"In order to accomplish this, our first task is to implant the subject instance into the output domain of the model and to bind the subject with a unique identifier. We present our method to design the identifier below as well as a new approach to supervise a fine-tuning process of the model such that it re-uses its prior for our subject instance. A key problem is that fine-tuning on a small set of images showing our subject is prone to overfitting on the given images. In addition, language drift Lee2019CounteringLD ; lu2020countering  is a common problem in language models, and manifests itself in text-to-image diffusion models as well: the model can forget how to generate other subjects of the same class, and lose the embedded knowledge on the diversity and natural variations of instances belonging to that class. For this, we present an autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, where we alleviate overfitting and prevent language drift by encouraging the diffusion model to keep generating diverse instances of the same class as our subject. The phenomenon of language drift has been an observed problem in the language model literature Lee2019CounteringLD ; lu2020countering , where a language model that is pre-trained on a large text corpus and later fine-tuned for a specific task progressively loses syntactic and semantic knowledge of the language as it learns to improve in the target task. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to find a similar phenomenon affecting diffusion models. Since our text prompt contains both the [identifier] and [class noun], when a diffusion model is fine-tuned on a small set of subject images, we observe that it slowly forgets how to generate subjects of the same class and progressively forgets the class-specific prior and can not generate different instances of the class in question. Figure 13 (middle) shows some sample generated images of “a dog” after fine-tuning the model on specific dog images. The results clearly show that the model loses the capability of generating generic dog images with naive fine-tuning. We propose an autogenous class-specific prior-preserving loss to counter both the overfitting and language drift issues. In essence, our method is to supervise the model with its own generated samples, in order for it to retain the prior once the few-shot fine-tuning begins. Specifically, we generate data \mathbf{x}_{\text{pr}}=\hat{\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{z}_{t_{1}},\mathbf{c}_{\text{pr}}) by using the ancestral sampler on the frozen pre-trained diffusion model with random initial noise \mathbf{z}_{t_{1}}\sim\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}) and conditioning vector \mathbf{c}_{\text{pr}}\coloneqq\Gamma(f(\text{""a [class noun]""})).

We show results for different context captions in Figure 12. We observe that the regularization effect of our loss allows us to capture a wider range of poses for our subject dog without sacrificing subject fidelity. Importantly, we observe that using naive fine-tuning the dog usually lies on a fabric-type material similar to the training images, whereas this is avoided using our method. Further, we evaluate how our prior preservation loss described in Section 4.2 conserves variability in the prior and show sample results in Figure 13. We verify that a vanilla model is able to generate a large variety of dogs, while a naively fine-tuned model on the subject dog exhibits language drift and generates our subject dog given the prompt “a dog”. Our proposed loss preserves the variability of the prior and the model is able to generate new instances of our dog given a prompt of the style “a [V] dog” but also varied instances of dogs given a “a dog” prompt.",Authors of the paper used a prior-preserving loss function.,"Semi-supervised refers to the fact that only a portion of the nodes (entities) have labeled outputs, while the rest are unlabeled",0.2142857099234695,0.071428567346939,0.1428571384948981,2.290276453812799,14.65075415348518,13.472036176468077,0.131578947368421,0.0109318063508589,0.1251212954521179,0.3756157388160754,0.1251213550567627,0.1231919527053833,0.0152392811477244,0.0,0.7491439344146654,0.7467192691501662
1511,Explain limitations of dreambooth,"Our method has several limitations, which we demonstrate in Figure 17, grouped into three main failure modes. The first is related to not being able to accurately generate the prompted context. For example, in Figure 17 we observe that when we prompt the model with “a [V] backpack in the ISS” and “a [V] backpack on the moon” it is not able to generate the desired contexts. Possible reasons are that the generative model does not have a strong prior for these contexts, or that representing both the subject and the context together is a difficult task for the model. The second failure mode is context-appearance entanglement, where the appearance of the subject changes due to the prompted context. In Figure 17 we show examples of a backpack that changes colors due to the desired context being rare (“a [V] backpack in the Bolivian Salt Flats”) or entangling the color of the context with that of the subject (“a [V] backpack on top of blue fabric”). Third, we also observe overfitting to the real images that happens when the prompt is similar to the original setting in which the subject was seen. An example is shown in Figure 17. Other limitations observed are that some subjects are much easier to learn than others. For example, the model has a very strong prior for dogs and cats, with many learned variations. Occasionally, with subjects that are rarer or more complex, the model is unable to support as many subject variations. Finally, there is also variability in the fidelity of the subject and some generated images might contain hallucinated features on the subject, depending on the strength of the model prior, and the complexity of the semantic modification.","Authors presented numerous drawbacks, the first of which is that it cannot accurately produce the required context. The second failure mode is context-appearance entanglement, in which the subject's appearance alters as a result of the prompted context. Third, we observe overfitting to real images when the prompt is similar to the original setting in which the subject was observed. Other limits discovered include the fact that some subjects are considerably easier to learn than others.",Performance,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.838842780813111,3.290436669268381,0.0,0.0001333155579256,0.1189349815249443,0.3281044661998749,0.2085752934217453,,0.0006424104387168,,0.8174925459566933,0.7829371300336123
1512,What are the FID values achieved by authors using Diffusion Model on ImageNet?,"For all comparisons in this section, we train models on ImageNet 128\times128 with batch size 256, and sample using 250 sampling steps. We train models with the above architecture changes and compare them on FID, evaluated at two different points of training, in Table 1. Aside from rescaling residual connections, all of the other modifications improve performance and have a positive compounding effect. We observe in Figure 2 that while increased depth helps performance, it increases training time and takes longer to reach the same performance as a wider model, so we opt not to use this change in further experiments. Table 4 also shows that classifier guidance improves precision at the cost of recall, thus introducing a trade-off in sample fidelity versus diversity. We explicitly evaluate how this trade-off varies with the gradient scale in Figure 4. We see that scaling the gradients beyond 1.0 smoothly trades off recall (a measure of diversity) for higher precision and IS (measures of fidelity). Since FID and sFID depend on both diversity and fidelity, their best values are obtained at an intermediate point. We also compare our guidance with the truncation trick from BigGAN in Figure 5. We find that classifier guidance is strictly better than BigGAN-deep when trading off FID for Inception Score. Less clear cut is the precision/recall trade-off, which shows that classifier guidance is only a better choice up until a certain precision threshold, after which point it cannot achieve better precision. Table 5 summarizes our results. Our diffusion models can obtain the best FID on each task, and the best sFID on all but one task. With the improved architecture, we already obtain state-of-the-art image generation on LSUN and ImageNet 64\times64. For higher resolution ImageNet, we observe that classifier guidance allows our models to substantially outperform the best GANs. These models obtain perceptual quality similar to GANs, while maintaining a higher coverage of the distribution as measured by recall, and can even do so using only 25 diffusion steps. We also compare guidance to using a two-stage upsampling stack. Nichol and Dhariwal [43] and Saharia et al. [53] train two-stage diffusion models by combining a low-resolution diffusion model with a corresponding upsampling diffusion model. In this approach, the upsampling model is trained to upsample images from the training set, and conditions on low-resolution images that are concatenated channel-wise to the model input using a simple interpolation (e.g. bilinear). During sampling, the low-resolution model produces a sample, and then the upsampling model is conditioned on this sample. This greatly improves FID on ImageNet 256\times256, but does not reach the same performance as state-of-the-art models like BigGAN-deep Nichol and Dhariwal (2021); Saharia et al. (2021), as seen in Table 5. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief background of diffusion models based on Ho et al. [25] and the improvements from Nichol and Dhariwal [43] and Song et al. [57], and we describe our evaluation setup. In Section 3, we introduce simple architecture improvements that give a substantial boost to FID. In Section 4, we describe a method for using gradients from a classifier to guide a diffusion model during sampling. We find that a single hyperparameter, the scale of the classifier gradients, can be tuned to trade off diversity for fidelity, and we can increase this gradient scale factor by an order of magnitude without obtaining adversarial examples Szegedy et al. (2013).Finally, in Section 5 we show that models with our improved architecture achieve state-of-the-art on unconditional image synthesis tasks, and with classifier guidance achieve state-of-the-art on conditional image synthesis. When using classifier guidance, we find that we can sample with as few as 25 forward passes while maintaining FIDs comparable to BigGAN. We also compare our improved models to upsampling stacks, finding that the two approaches give complementary improvements and that combining them gives the best results on ImageNet 256\times256 and 512\times512.","They obtain state-of-the-art image generation on ImageNet 64×64.

1513,Why are GANs so difficult to train?,"GANs Goodfellow et al. (2014) currently hold the state-of-the-art on most image generation tasks Brock et al. (2018); Wu et al. (2019); Karras et al. (2019b) as measured by sample quality metrics such as FID Heusel et al. (2017), Inception Score Salimans et al. (2016) and Precision Kynkäänniemi et al. (2019). However, some of these metrics do not fully capture diversity, and it has been shown that GANs capture less diversity than state-of-the-art likelihood-based models Razavi et al. (2019); Nichol and Dhariwal (2021); Nash et al. (2021). Furthermore, GANs are often difficult to train, collapsing without carefully selected hyperparameters and regularizers Brock et al. (2018); Miyato et al. (2018); Brock et al. (2016). While GANs hold the state-of-the-art, their drawbacks make them difficult to scale and apply to new domains. As a result, much work has been done to achieve GAN-like sample quality with likelihood-based models Razavi et al. (2019); Ho et al. (2020); Nash et al. (2021); Child (2021). While these models capture more diversity and are typically easier to scale and train than GANs, they still fall short in terms of visual sample quality. Furthermore, except for VAEs, sampling from these models is slower than GANs in terms of wall-clock time.","GANs are often difficult to train, collapsing without carefully selected hyperparameters and regularizers. Much work has been done to achieve GAN-like sample quality with likelihood-based models and they are typically easier to scale and train than GANs.","Beam search in this context refers to a search algorithm used during decoding that explores a set of possible output sequences simultaneously, with the goal of finding the most likely sequence. The algorithm starts with a fixed number of sequences (the beam width) and iteratively expands the sequences that are most likely to be correct, based on the model's predictions and the input sequence. The beam width is gradually increased during decoding when the network fails to produce the ""end-of-sequence"" token with the narrower beam",0.0919540184013742,0.0,0.0919540184013742,0.4342475113655687,17.41914079577713,14.59769626459587,0.13215859030837,0.010644959298685,0.1283691078424453,0.48927343753447,0.1646372750401497,0.2845445275306701,0.0188037116542778,0.0,0.7228729759276119,0.7420297738101012
1514,How do we obtain the noise(epsilon) in a diffusion model?,"On a high level, diffusion models sample from a distribution by reversing a gradual noising process. In particular, sampling starts with noise x_{T} and produces gradually less-noisy samples x_{T-1},x_{T-2},... until reaching a final sample x_{0}. Each timestep t corresponds to a certain noise level, and x_{t} can be thought of as a mixture of a signal x_{0} with some noise \epsilon where the signal to noise ratio is determined by the timestep t. For the remainder of this paper, we assume that the noise \epsilon is drawn from a diagonal Gaussian distribution, which works well for natural images and simplifies various derivations. A diffusion model learns to produce a slightly more “denoised” x_{t-1} from x_{t}. Ho et al. [25] parameterize this model as a function \epsilon_{\theta}(x_{t},t) which predicts the noise component of a noisy sample x_{t}. To train these models, each sample in a minibatch is produced by randomly drawing a data sample x_{0}, a timestep t, and noise \epsilon, which together give rise to a noised sample x_{t} (Equation 17).The training objective is then ||\epsilon_{\theta}(x_{t},t)-\epsilon||^{2}, i.e. a simple mean-squared error loss between the true noise and the predicted noise (Equation 26).","Diffusion models sample from a distribution by reversing a gradual noising process. In particular, sampling starts with noise xT and produces gradually less-noisy samples xT −1, xT −2, ... until reaching a final sample x0.

Here's the answer to the question based on the given context:

1515,Which are the metrics used by authors to compare the performance of the models?,"Inception Score (IS) was proposed by Salimans et al. [54], and it measures how well a model captures the full ImageNet class distribution while still producing individual samples that are convincing examples of a single class. One drawback of this metric is that it does not reward covering the whole distribution or capturing diversity within a class, and models which memorize a small subset of the full dataset will still have high IS Barratt and Sharma (2018). To better capture diversity than IS, Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) was proposed by Heusel et al. [23], who argued that it is more consistent with human judgement than Inception Score. FID provides a symmetric measure of the distance between two image distributions in the Inception-V3 Szegedy et al. (2015) latent space. Recently, sFID was proposed by Nash et al. [42] as a version of FID that uses spatial features rather than the standard pooled features. They find that this metric better captures spatial relationships, rewarding image distributions with coherent high-level structure. Finally, Kynkäänniemi et al. [32] proposed Improved Precision and Recall metrics to separately measure sample fidelity as the fraction of model samples which fall into the data manifold (precision), and diversity as the fraction of data samples which fall into the sample manifold (recall). We use FID as our default metric for overall sample quality comparisons as it captures both diversity and fidelity and has been the de facto standard metric for state-of-the-art generative modeling work Karras et al. (2019a, b); Brock et al. (2018); Ho et al. (2020). We use Precision or IS to measure fidelity, and Recall to measure diversity or distribution coverage. When comparing against other methods, we re-compute these metrics using public samples or models whenever possible. This is for two reasons: first, some papers Karras et al. (2019a, b); Ho et al. (2020) compare against arbitrary subsets of the training set which are not readily available; and second, subtle implementation differences can affect the resulting FID values Parmar et al. (2021). To ensure consistent comparisons, we use the entire training set as the reference batch Heusel et al. (2017); Brock et al. (2018), and evaluate metrics for all models using the same codebase. For all comparisons in this section, we train models on ImageNet 128\times128 with batch size 256, and sample using 250 sampling steps. We train models with the above architecture changes and compare them on FID, evaluated at two different points of training, in Table 1.

1516,What is the final improved architecture used by authors for experiments in this paper?,"In this section we conduct several architecture ablations to find the model architecture that provides the best sample quality for diffusion models.

We observe in Figure 2 that while increased depth helps performance, it increases training time and takes longer to reach the same performance as a wider model, so we opt not to use this change in further experiments. In the rest of the paper, we use this final improved model architecture as our default: variable width with 2 residual blocks per resolution, multiple heads with 64 channels per head, attention at 32, 16 and 8 resolutions, BigGAN residual blocks for up and downsampling, and adaptive group normalization for injecting timestep and class embeddings into residual blocks.

1517,Why did the authors have to scale the classifier gradients by a constant factor larger than 1?,"We can safely ignore the constant term C_{4}, since it corresponds to the normalizing coefficient Z in Equation 2. We have thus found that the conditional transition operator can be approximated by a Gaussian similar to the unconditional transition operator, but with its mean shifted by \Sigma g. Algorithm 1 summaries the corresponding sampling algorithm. We include an optional scale factor s for the gradients, which we describe in more detail in Section 4.3. In initial experiments with unconditional ImageNet models, we found it necessary to scale the classifier gradients by a constant factor larger than 1. When using a scale of 1, we observed that the classifier assigned reasonable probabilities (around 50%) to the desired classes for the final samples, but these samples did not match the intended classes upon visual inspection.Scaling up the classifier gradients remedied this problem, and the class probabilities from the classifier increased to nearly 100%. Figure 3 shows an example of this effect. To understand the effect of scaling classifier gradients, note that s\cdot\mathop{}\!\nabla_{\!x}\log p(y|x)=\mathop{}\!\nabla_{\!x}\log\frac{1}{Z}p(y|x)^{s}, where Z is an arbitrary constant. As a result, the conditioning process is still theoretically grounded in a re-normalized classifier distribution proportional to p(y|x)^{s}. When s>1, this distribution becomes sharper than p(y|x), since larger values are amplified by the exponent. In other words, using a larger gradient scale focuses more on the modes of the classifier, which is potentially desirable for producing higher fidelity (but less diverse) samples. Table 4 also shows that classifier guidance improves precision at the cost of recall, thus introducing a trade-off in sample fidelity versus diversity. We explicitly evaluate how this trade-off varies with the gradient scale in Figure 4.

1518,How does the trade-off between fidelity and diversity vary with the Gradient Scale?,"We hypothesize that the gap between diffusion models and GANs stems from at least two factors: first, that the model architectures used by recent GAN literature have been heavily explored and refined; second, that GANs are able to trade off diversity for fidelity, producing high quality samples but not covering the whole distribution. We aim to bring these benefits to diffusion models, first by improving model architecture and then by devising a scheme for trading off diversity for fidelity. With these improvements, we achieve a new state-of-the-art, surpassing GANs on several different metrics and datasets.

We find that a single hyperparameter, the scale of the classifier gradients, can be tuned to trade off diversity for fidelity, and we can increase this gradient scale factor by an order of magnitude without obtaining adversarial examples Szegedy et al. (2013).Finally, in Section 5 we show that models with our improved architecture achieve state-of-the-art on unconditional image synthesis tasks, and with classifier guidance achieve state-of-the-art on conditional image synthesis. When using classifier guidance, we find that we can sample with as few as 25 forward passes while maintaining FIDs comparable to BigGAN. We also compare our improved models to upsampling stacks, finding that the two approaches give complementary improvements and that combining them gives the best results on ImageNet 256\times256 and 512\times512. We have shown that diffusion models, a class of likelihood-based models with a stationary training objective, can obtain better sample quality than state-of-the-art GANs. Our improved architecture is sufficient to achieve this on unconditional image generation tasks, and our classifier guidance technique allows us to do so on class-conditional tasks. In the latter case, we find that the scale of the classifier gradients can be adjusted to trade off diversity for fidelity. These guided diffusion models can reduce the sampling time gap between GANs and diffusion models, although diffusion models still require multiple forward passes during sampling. Finally, by combining guidance with upsampling, we can further improve sample quality on high-resolution conditional image synthesis.","When using a scale of 1, we observed that the classifier assigned reasonable probabilities (around 50%) to the desired classes for the final samples, but these samples did not match the intended classes upon visual inspection. Scaling up the classifier gradients remedied this problem, and the class probabilities from the classifier increased to nearly 100%. Using a larger gradient scale focuses more on the modes of the classifier, which is potentially desirable for producing higher fidelity (but less diverse) samples.","The limitations of the parametric aggregation of knowledge with MTL include:

1. Retraining the full model when adding new tasks.
2. Catastrophic forgetting and interference between tasks, leading to difficulties in solving each task equally well.

1519,What is IS as a measure of fidelity?,"Inception Score (IS) was proposed by Salimans et al. [54], and it measures how well a model captures the full ImageNet class distribution while still producing individual samples that are convincing examples of a single class. One drawback of this metric is that it does not reward covering the whole distribution or capturing diversity within a class, and models which memorize a small subset of the full dataset will still have high IS Barratt and Sharma (2018). To better capture diversity than IS, Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) was proposed by Heusel et al. [23], who argued that it is more consistent with human judgement than Inception Score. FID provides a symmetric measure of the distance between two image distributions in the Inception-V3 Szegedy et al. (2015) latent space. Recently, sFID was proposed by Nash et al. [42] as a version of FID that uses spatial features rather than the standard pooled features. They find that this metric better captures spatial relationships, rewarding image distributions with coherent high-level structure. Finally, Kynkäänniemi et al. [32] proposed Improved Precision and Recall metrics to separately measure sample fidelity as the fraction of model samples which fall into the data manifold (precision), and diversity as the fraction of data samples which fall into the sample manifold (recall). Table 4 also shows that classifier guidance improves precision at the cost of recall, thus introducing a trade-off in sample fidelity versus diversity. We explicitly evaluate how this trade-off varies with the gradient scale in Figure 4. We see that scaling the gradients beyond 1.0 smoothly trades off recall (a measure of diversity) for higher precision and IS (measures of fidelity). Since FID and sFID depend on both diversity and fidelity, their best values are obtained at an intermediate point. We also compare our guidance with the truncation trick from BigGAN in Figure 5. We find that classifier guidance is strictly better than BigGAN-deep when trading off FID for Inception Score. Less clear cut is the precision/recall trade-off, which shows that classifier guidance is only a better choice up until a certain precision threshold, after which point it cannot achieve better precision.","IS measures of fidelity but it has a drawback that it does not reward covering the whole distribution or capturing diversity within a class, and models which memorize a small subset of the full dataset will still have high IS.",No. Only Blended diffusion (Avrahami et al.) does not use user-provided masks for the guidance of manipulation,0.1538461493195267,0.0357142814859698,0.1538461493195267,2.1962438984958195,21.5940757299652,19.293052600357576,0.0932330827067669,0.0045735808447672,0.1943513005971908,0.2602676228743118,0.1526604443788528,0.2394726425409317,0.0018265419340035,,0.7119796277153103,0.7316931070882087
1520,"In terms of image synthesis, do the GANs perform better than VQ-VAE or not?","GANs Goodfellow et al. (2014) currently hold the state-of-the-art on most image generation tasks Brock et al. (2018); Wu et al. (2019); Karras et al. (2019b) as measured by sample quality metrics such as FID Heusel et al. (2017), Inception Score Salimans et al. (2016) and Precision Kynkäänniemi et al. (2019). However, some of these metrics do not fully capture diversity, and it has been shown that GANs capture less diversity than state-of-the-art likelihood-based models Razavi et al. (2019); Nichol and Dhariwal (2021); Nash et al. (2021). Furthermore, GANs are often difficult to train, collapsing without carefully selected hyperparameters and regularizers Brock et al. (2018); Miyato et al. (2018); Brock et al. (2016). While GANs hold the state-of-the-art, their drawbacks make them difficult to scale and apply to new domains. As a result, much work has been done to achieve GAN-like sample quality with likelihood-based models Razavi et al. (2019); Ho et al. (2020); Nash et al. (2021); Child (2021). While these models capture more diversity and are typically easier to scale and train than GANs, they still fall short in terms of visual sample quality. Furthermore, except for VAEs, sampling from these models is slower than GANs in terms of wall-clock time. Table 5 summarizes our results. Our diffusion models can obtain the best FID on each task, and the best sFID on all but one task. With the improved architecture, we already obtain state-of-the-art image generation on LSUN and ImageNet 64\times64. For higher resolution ImageNet, we observe that classifier guidance allows our models to substantially outperform the best GANs. These models obtain perceptual quality similar to GANs, while maintaining a higher coverage of the distribution as measured by recall, and can even do so using only 25 diffusion steps. Other likelihood-based models have been shown to produce high-fidelity image samples. VQ-VAE van den Oord et al. (2017) and VQ-VAE-2 Razavi et al. (2019) are autoregressive models trained on top of quantized latent codes, greatly reducing the computational resources required to train these models on large images. These models produce diverse and high quality images, but still fall short of GANs without expensive rejection sampling and special metrics to compensate for blurriness. DCTransformer Nash et al. (2021) is a related method which relies on a more intelligent compression scheme. VAEs are another promising class of likelihood-based models, and recent methods such as NVAE Vahdat and Kautz (2020) and VDVAE Child (2021) have successfully been applied to difficult image generation domains. Energy-based models are another class of likelihood-based models with a rich history Ackley et al. (1985); Dayan et al. (1995); Hinton (2002). Sampling from the EBM distribution is challenging, and Xie et al. [70] demonstrate that Langevin dynamics can be used to sample coherent images from these models. Du and Mordatch [15] further improve upon this approach, obtaining high quality images. More recently, Gao et al. [18] incorporate diffusion steps into an energy-based model, and find that doing so improves image samples from these models.","Fidelity can be higher, but GANs are not always better in terms of low diversity.

1521,Why did authors recompute some of the metrics using public samples or models?,"We use FID as our default metric for overall sample quality comparisons as it captures both diversity and fidelity and has been the de facto standard metric for state-of-the-art generative modeling work Karras et al.
