How does the β-VAE objective contribute to disentangling in this work?,"By assuming all unobserved interactions are negative and using negative sampling strategies, such as random sampling or non-uniform distributions, to alleviate the computational burden and improve recommendation performance","Tthe β-VAE objective to show that its contribution to disentangling is primarily through direct control of the level of overlap between encodings of the data, expressed by maximising the entropy of the encoding distribution.","Taken together, this implies that the \beta-vae’s ability to encourage disentanglement is predominantly through direct control over the level of overlap.It places no other direct constraint on the latents to disentangle (although in some cases, the annealed prior may inadvertently encourage better disentanglement), but instead helps avoid the pitfalls of inappropriate overlap.Amongst other things, this explains why large \beta is not universally beneficial for disentanglement, as the level of overlap can be increased too far. Connecting prior work on disentanglement to this framework, we analysed the \beta-vae objective to show that its contribution to disentangling is primarily through direct control of the level of overlap between encodings of the data, expressed by maximising the entropy of the encoding distribution.In the commonly encountered case of assuming an isotropic Gaussian prior and an independent Gaussian posterior, we showed that control of overlap is the only effect of the \beta-vae.Motivated by this observation, we developed an alternate objective for the elbo that allows control of the two factors of decomposability through an additional regularisation term.We then conducted empirical evaluations using this objective, targeting alternate forms of decompositions such as clustering and sparsity, and observed the effect of varying the extent of regularisation to the prior on the quality of the resulting clustering and sparseness of the learnt embeddings.The results indicate that we were successful in attaining those decompositions. To connect our framework with existing approaches for encouraging disentanglement, we provide a theoretical analysis of the \beta-vae [17, 3, 2], and show that it typically only allows control of latent overlap, the first decomposition factor.We show that it can be interpreted, up to a constant offset, as the standard vae objective with its prior annealed as p_{{\theta}}\left(\bm{z}\right)^{\beta} and an additional maximum entropy regularization of the encoder that increases the stochasticity of the encodings.Specialising this result for the typical choice of a Gaussian encoder and isotropic Gaussian prior indicates that the \beta-vae, up to a scaling of the latent space, is equivalent to the vae plus a regulariser encouraging higher encoder variance.Moreover, this objective is invariant to rotations of the learned latent representation, meaning that it does not, on its own, encourage the latent variables to take on meaningful representations any more than an arbitrary rotation of them."
In what ways does the ELBO objective in this work allow for control of decomposability?,Yes,Elbo objective allows control of the two factors of decomposability through an additional regularisation term,"Connecting prior work on disentanglement to this framework, we analysed the \beta-vae objective to show that its contribution to disentangling is primarily through direct control of the level of overlap between encodings of the data, expressed by maximising the entropy of the encoding distribution.In the commonly encountered case of assuming an isotropic Gaussian prior and an independent Gaussian posterior, we showed that control of overlap is the only effect of the \beta-vae.Motivated by this observation, we developed an alternate objective for the elbo that allows control of the two factors of decomposability through an additional regularisation term.We then conducted empirical evaluations using this objective, targeting alternate forms of decompositions such as clustering and sparsity, and observed the effect of varying the extent of regularisation to the prior on the quality of the resulting clustering and sparseness of the learnt embeddings.The results indicate that we were successful in attaining those decompositions."
How flexible can the residual function be in residual learning?,"No.

The possibility of having many rules does not make the system ambiguous because the system relies on the sign agreement between the goal and the consequent of the selected rule to determine the outcome. The system is designed to select the rule that leads to a conclusion that agrees with the sign of the goal, and it can only arrive at one conclusion based on the available information. Therefore, the system is not ambiguous, and it can provide a clear answer to the question at hand",the residual function in residual learning is flexible enough to be used for single/multiple and fully-connected/convolutional layers,"The form of the residual function \mathcal{F} is flexible. Experiments in this paper involve a function \mathcal{F} that has two or three layers (Fig. 5), while more layers are possible. But if \mathcal{F} has only a single layer, Eqn.(1) is similar to a linear layer: \mathbf{y}=W_{1}\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{x}, for which we have not observed advantages."
What is the ImageNet classification dataset and how is it used in the experiments?,"Neural integration of different KGs is better than symbolic KG integration because it does not require additional processing and alignment information between KGs, allowing for the integration of a larger number of triples and relations without losing knowledge","ImageNet 2012 classification dataset [36] that consists of 1000 classes. The model are trained on the 1.28 million training images, and evaluated on the 50k validation images. We also obtain a final result on the 100k test images, reported by the test server. We evaluate both top-1 and top-5 error rates.","We evaluate our method on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset [36] that consists of 1000 classes.

"What are identity shortcuts and projection shortcuts, and how are they used in the experiments?","The main difference in labeling procedures for classification datasets and detection datasets is the level of granularity and specificity in the labels. Classification datasets have a much wider and deeper range of labels, with multiple breeds of dogs, while detection datasets typically have only common objects and general labels","The identity and projection shortcut are not defined in this section. Identity shortcuts help in training, do not increase the complexity of the bottleneck architectures and solve degradation problem. projection shortcuts are not essential for addressing the degradation problem so these are not considered. Projection shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions","Identity vs. Projection Shortcuts.We have shown that parameter-free, identity shortcuts help with training. Next we investigate projection shortcuts (Eqn.(2)).In Table 3 we compare three options: (A) zero-padding shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions, and all shortcuts are parameter-free (the same as Table 2 and Fig. 4 right); (B) projection shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions, and other shortcuts are identity; and (C) all shortcuts are projections. Table 3 shows that all three options are considerably better than the plain counterpart.B is slightly better than A. We argue that this is because the zero-padded dimensions in A indeed have no residual learning. C is marginally better than B, and we attribute this to the extra parameters introduced by many (thirteen) projection shortcuts. But the small differences among A/B/C indicate that projection shortcuts are not essential for addressing the degradation problem. So we do not use option C in the rest of this paper, to reduce memory/time complexity and model sizes. Identity shortcuts are particularly important for not increasing the complexity of the bottleneck architectures that are introduced below."
What is the motivation behind using residual learning in deep neural networks?,"The late interaction mechanism decreases computational costs by over 170 times in latency and 13,900 times in FLOPs compared to the early interaction model, while maintaining similar performance",[Residual learning is used to solve degradation problem in deep neural networks.],"[""This reformulation is motivated ……….. zero to approach identity mappings.""]"
How does residual learning address the degradation problem in deep neural networks?,"Model transferability refers to the ability of a trained model to perform well on a different dataset or task, often with different characteristics than the training data.

What is the purpose of the experiments described?,Computational demand is measured by the number of parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs) required by a network,"[Using imageNet/CIFAR-10  data set , classification is evaluated for plain/residual networks and compared with state of the art.

How do the authors define plain networks and residual networks?,"Non-differentiable here refers to the fact that the metrics used to evaluate the quality of generated text, such as BERTScore, BLEURT, and summarization preferences, are not differentiable at the individual token level. Instead, they provide a single quality estimate for a full generation of text. This makes it difficult to optimize these metrics using traditional reinforcement learning methods, which rely on differentiability to update model parameters. The authors are looking for a way to optimize non-differentiable objectives using reinforcement learning despite this limitation","[Plain network do not use shortcut connections whereas in residual networks, shortcut

How does the depth of the residual networks affect their performance in the experiments?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

It also addresses degradation problem ]","["" We have three major observations from Table 2 and Fig. 4. First, the situation is reversed with residual learning ……. from increased depth..""]"
How does the deep residual learning framework address the degradation problem in deep convolutional neural networks?,Yes,The deep residual learning framework address the degradation problem using residual mapping instead of original mapping in deep convolutional neural network,"In this paper, we address the degradation problem by introducing a deep residual learning framework.Instead of hoping each few stacked layers directly fit a desired underlying mapping, we explicitly let these layers fit a residual mapping. Formally, denoting the desired underlying mapping as \mathcal{H}(\mathbf{x}), we let the stacked nonlinear layers fit another mapping of \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x}):=\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{x})-\mathbf{x}. The original mapping is recast into \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x})+\mathbf{x}.We hypothesize that it is easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the original, unreferenced mapping. To the extreme, if an identity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push the residual to zero than to fit an identity mapping by a stack of nonlinear layers."
"How do shortcut connections, or identity mapping, contribute to the effectiveness of the deep residual learning framework?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Two types of inputs are used for the proposed model:

1. Image patches (natural and moving MNIST digits)
2. High-level percepts extracted from a convolutional neural net model trained on ImageNet",The use of identity mapping/shortcut connections can skip one or more layers from network without introducing any extra parameter or computational complexity.

What is the importance of normalization in deep networks and how does it contribute to the effectiveness of the deep residual learning framework?,"Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are related in that they both involve decomposing a matrix into three matrices, but they differ in the type of decomposition and the matrices involved. EVD decomposes a square matrix into three matrices of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, while SVD decomposes a matrix into three matrices of singular vectors and singular values",Normalization is used in initialization and intermediate layers.

"How does the use of shortcut connections in this paper compare to previous practices and theories, such as those used in MLPs and highway networks?","Sure! Here's my answer:

With high confidence, as the proposed latency prediction model has a MAPE of only 0.16%, indicating a high degree of accuracy",The shortcut connections presented in this paper are parameter free and always learn residual functions. All information is always passed through additional residual functions to be learned. It also demonstrate the accuracy gain with increased depths unlike highway network. The highway network uses shortcut connections with gating functions which are data dependent and have parameters. It uses non-residual functions when identity shortcut is closed. MLP uses shortcut connections with an additional linear layer from input to output for training. It does not uses residual functions,"Shortcut Connections.Practices and theories that lead to shortcut connections [2, 34, 49] have been studied for a long time.An early practice of training multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) is to add a linear layer connected from the network input to the output [34, 49]. In [44, 24], a few intermediate layers are directly connected to auxiliary classifiers for addressing vanishing/exploding gradients. The papers of [39, 38, 31, 47] propose methods for centering layer responses, gradients, and propagated errors, implemented by shortcut connections. In [44], an “inception” layer is composed of a shortcut branch and a few deeper branches. Concurrent with our work, “highway networks” [42, 43] present shortcut connections with gating functions [15]. These gates are data-dependent and have parameters, in contrast to our identity shortcuts that are parameter-free. When a gated shortcut is “closed” (approaching zero), the layers in highway networks represent non-residual functions. On the contrary, our formulation always learns residual functions; our identity shortcuts are never closed, and all information is always passed through, with additional residual functions to be learned. In addition, highway networks have not demonstrated accuracy gains with extremely increased depth (e.g., over 100 layers)."
"How does the use of identity shortcuts in this paper, which are parameter-free and always pass information through, differ from gated shortcuts used in highway networks that can be closed and block information?","The authors used gradient descent instead of other optimization algorithms because it is well-suited for minimizing the squared-error loss function used in their task, and it allows for efficient computation of the gradients of the loss with respect to the activations in lower layers of the network",The identity shortcuts presented in this paper differ from gated shortcuts because it don’t depend on data and always learn residual functions.,"""Concurrent with our work, “highway networks” …….depth (e.g., over 100 layers)."""
In what ways has the use of residual representations and shortcut connections improved the accuracy of deep neural networks in image recognition tasks?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

To reduce the dimensionality of the input data while preserving the most important information.

By selecting these three values for alpha (VTHarm, Concatd, and Pool), the model can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the input data while preserving the most important information. VTHarm helps to capture the long-term dependencies in the data, Concatd allows for the concatenation of features across time, and Pool reduces the spatial dimensions of the data. This combination of techniques enables the model to capture complex patterns in the data and make accurate predictions",The residual representation presents a powerful shallow representation for image retrieval tasks.

How does the effectiveness of the residual representation method used in this paper compare to other methods such as Multigrid and hierarchical basis preconditioning in solving Partial Differential Equations?,"The equations for Q-value and value represent the expected return or value of taking a particular action in a particular state, and the expected return or value of taking any action in any state, respectively.

Specifically, the Q-value equation, Q_t^π(s_t, a_t) = R(s_t, a_t, y) + γ \* E_s[V_t^π(s_t+1)], represents the expected return of taking action a_t in state s_t and then following policy π thereafter, where E_s[ ] represents the expected value over the next state distribution.

The value equation, V_t^π(s_t) = E_a[Q_t^π(s_t, a_t)], represents the expected value of taking any action in state s_t, where E_a[ ] represents the expected value over all possible actions","Multigrid method reformulates the system as sub problems at multiple scales, where each sub problem is responsible for the residual solution between a coarser and a finer scale. Hierarchical basis preconditioning relies on variables that represent residual vectors between two scales. The effectiveness of residual representation method presented in this paper cannot be compared to these methods in this paper","""In low-level vision and computer…………..or preconditioning can simplify the optimization."""
What are the different approaches that have been used in face recognition technology over the years?,"Zipf distribution and Uniform distribution differ in the way they allocate probability to words. In Zipf distribution, the probability of a word is inversely proportional to its frequency, while in Uniform distribution, all words have an equal probability","Starting from the 1990s to the 2000s, holistic approaches were the most prominent direction in face recognition, Later on, local-feature-based face recognition was introduced. In the 2010s, shallow learning-based-local-descriptors were used. In 2014, the DeepFace, a deep learning-based model, was invented. And ever since, the state-of-the-art techniques were from deep learning-based approaches.","Face recognition (FR) has been the prominent biometric technique for identity authentication and has been widely used in many areas, such as military, finance, public security and daily life. FR has been a long-standing research topic in the CVPR community. In the early 1990s, the study of FR became popular following the introduction of the historical Eigenface approach [1]. The milestones of feature-based FR over the past years are presented in Fig. 1, in which the times of four major technical streams are highlighted. The holistic approaches derive the low-dimensional representation through certain distribution assumptions, such as linear subspace [2][3][4], manifold [5][6][7], and sparse representation [8][9][10][11]. This idea dominated the FR community in the 1990s and 2000s. However, a well-known problem is that these theoretically plausible holistic methods fail to address the uncontrolled facial changes that deviate from their prior assumptions. In the early 2000s, this problem gave rise to local-feature-based FR. Gabor [12] and LBP [13], as well as their multilevel and high-dimensional extensions [14][15][16], achieved robust performance through some invariant properties of local filtering. Unfortunately, handcrafted features suffered from a lack of distinctiveness and compactness. In the early 2010s, learning-based local descriptors were introduced to the FR community [17][18][19], in which local filters are learned for better distinctiveness and the encoding codebook is learned for better compactness. However, these shallow representations still have an inevitable limitation on robustness against the complex nonlinear facial appearance variations. In general, traditional methods attempted to recognize human face by one or two layer representations, such as filtering responses, histogram of the feature codes, or distribution of the dictionary atoms. The research community studied intensively to separately improve the preprocessing, local descriptors, and feature transformation, but these approaches improved FR accuracy slowly. What’s worse, most methods aimed to address one aspect of unconstrained facial changes only, such as lighting, pose, expression, or disguise. There was no any integrated technique to address these unconstrained challenges integrally. As a result, with continuous efforts of more than a decade, “shallow” methods only improved the accuracy of the LFW benchmark to about 95% [15], which indicates that “shallow” methods are insufficient to extract stable identity feature invariant to real-world changes. Due to the insufficiency of this technical, facial recognition systems were often reported with unstable performance or failures with countless false alarms in real-world applications. In 2014, DeepFace [20] achieved the SOTA accuracy on the famous LFW benchmark [23], approaching human performance on the unconstrained condition for the first time (DeepFace: 97.35% vs. Human: 97.53%), by training a 9-layer model on 4 million facial images. Inspired by this work, research focus has shifted to deep-learning-based approaches, and the accuracy was dramatically boosted to above 99.80% in just three years. Deep learning technique has reshaped the research landscape of FR in almost all aspects such as algorithm designs, training/test datasets, application scenarios and even the evaluation protocols. Therefore, it is of great significance to review the breakthrough and rapid development process in recent years. There have been several surveys on FR [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and its subdomains, and they mostly summarized and compared a diverse set of techniques related to a specific FR scene, such as illumination-invariant FR [29], 3D FR [28], pose-invariant FR [30][31]. Unfortunately, due to their earlier publication dates, none of them covered the deep learning methodology that is most successful nowadays. This survey focuses only on recognition problem, and one can refer to Ranjan et al. [32] for a brief review of a full deep FR pipeline with detection and alignment, or refer to Jin et al. [33] for a survey of face alignment. Specifically, the major contributions of this survey are as follows: We present the development of face processing methods in chronological order in Fig. 12. As we can see from the figure, most papers attempted to perform face processing by autoencoder model in 2014 and 2015; while 3D model played an important role in 2016. GAN [40] has drawn substantial attention from the deep learning and computer vision community since it was first proposed by Goodfellow et al. It can be used in different fields and was also introduced into face processing in 2017. GAN can be used to perform “one-to-many augmentation” and “many-to-one normalization”, and it broke the limit that face synthesis should be done under supervised way. Although GAN has not been widely used in face processing for training and recognition, it has great latent capacity for preprocessing, for example, Dual-Agent GANs (DA-GAN) [56] won the 1st places on verification and identification tracks in the NIST IJB-A 2017 FR competitions."
How has deep learning improved the accuracy of face recognition systems compared to traditional methods?,"The eight variants of LSTMs investigated by the authors of this paper have the following hyperparameters:

1. Number of LSTM blocks per hidden layer: log-uniform samples from [20, 200]
2. Learning rate: log-uniform samples from [10^-6, 10^-2]
3. Momentum: 1 - log-uniform samples from [0.01, 1.0]
4. Standard deviation of Gaussian input noise: uniform samples from [0, 1]","The traditional methods (i.e holistic approaches, local-feature-based methods, shallow learning) were the approaches used before the boom of deep learning based techniques. They could achieve an accuracy of 95%, while the human accuracy was 97.53%. The rapid progress of deep learning methods quickly equaled human performance (DeepFace 97.35%) and later on surpassed them with 99.8%. These methods could achieve such numbers by using bigger and bigger datasets and new architectures.","In general, traditional methods attempted to recognize human face by one or two layer representations, such as filtering responses, histogram of the feature codes, or distribution of the dictionary atoms.

Due to the insufficiency of this technical, facial recognition systems were often reported with unstable performance or failures with countless false alarms in real-world applications. With the evolved architectures and advanced training techniques, such as batch normalization (BN), the network becomes deeper and the training becomes more controllable. Following these architectures in object classification, the networks in deep FR are also developed step by step, and the performance of deep FR is continually improving. We present these mainstream architectures of deep FR in Fig. 9. In 2014, DeepFace [20] was the first to use a nine-layer CNN with several locally connected layers. With 3D alignment for face processing, it reaches an accuracy of 97.35% on LFW. In 2015, FaceNet [38] used a large private dataset to train a GoogleNet. It adopted a triplet loss function based on triplets of roughly aligned matching/nonmatching face patches generated by a novel online triplet mining method and achieved good performance of 99.63%. In the same year, VGGface [37] designed a procedure to collect a large-scale dataset from the Internet. It trained the VGGNet on this dataset and then fine-tuned the networks via a triplet loss function similar to FaceNet. VGGface obtains an accuracy of 98.95%. In 2017, SphereFace [84] used a 64-layer ResNet architecture and proposed the angular softmax (A-Softmax) loss to learn discriminative face features with angular margin. It boosts the achieves to 99.42% on LFW. In the end of 2017, a new large-scale face dataset, namely VGGface2 [39], was introduced, which consists of large variations in pose, age, illumination, ethnicity and profession. Cao et al. first trained a SENet with MS-celeb-1M dataset [45] and then fine-tuned the model with VGGface2 [39], and achieved the SOTA performance on the IJB-A [41] and IJB-B [42]. In 2014, DeepFace [20] achieved the SOTA accuracy on the famous LFW benchmark [23], approaching human performance on the unconstrained condition for the first time (DeepFace: 97.35% vs. Human: 97.53%), by training a 9-layer model on 4 million facial images.

In what areas has face recognition technology been commonly used?,"The authors designed the meta-path prediction task by defining a binary label for each meta-path in the heterogeneous graph, where a label of 1 indicates that the meta-path is present in the graph, and 0 otherwise","Face recognition is widely used in the military, finance, public security, and daily life.","Face recognition (FR) has been the prominent biometric technique for identity authentication and has been widely used in many areas, such as military, finance, public security and daily life.

Deep face recognition has been successfully applied on many user-cooperated applications, but the ubiquitous recognition applications in everywhere are still an ambitious goal. In practice, it is difficult to collect and label sufficient samples for innumerable scenes in real world. One promising solution is to first learn a general model and then transfer it to an application-specific scene. While deep domain adaptation [145] has recently been applied to reduce the algorithm bias on different scenes [148], different races [173], general solution to transfer face recognition is largely open."
What are the three main modules of a face recognition system?,"No.

Slanted triangular learning rates (STLR) and linear warmup followed by linear decay are not the same thing, although they both involve adjusting the learning rate during training. STLR involves a short increase and a long decay period, while linear warmup followed by linear decay is a more gradual increase and decrease of the learning rate over time","The 3 main modules are: face detection, facial landmark detector, and FR module.","Before a face image is fed to an FR module, face anti-spoofing, which recognizes whether the face is live or spoofed, is applied to avoid different types of attacks. Then, recognition can be performed. As shown in Fig. 3(c), an FR module consists of face processing, deep feature extraction and face matching, and it can be described as follows: As mentioned in [32], there are three modules needed for FR system, as shown in Fig. 3. First, a face detector is used to localize faces in images or videos. Second, with the facial landmark detector, the faces are aligned to normalized canonical coordinates. Third, the FR module is implemented with these aligned face images. We only focus on the FR module throughout the remainder of this paper."
How is deep learning used in the process of feature extraction in face recognition systems?,Error rates,The deep learning model does feature extraction by processing the image through many layers and giving an encoding of the face that can be used to solve different FR tasks. The early layers of a deep learning model tend to represent simple textures that continuously evolve into facial structures in the later layers.,"For most applications, it is difficult to include the candidate faces during the training stage, which makes FR become a “zero-shot” learning task. Fortunately, since all human faces share a similar shape and texture, the representation learned from a small proportion of faces can generalize well to the rest. Based on this theory, a straightforward way to improve generalized performance is to include as many IDs as possible in the training set. For example, Internet giants such as Facebook and Google have reported their deep FR system trained by 10^{6}-10^{7} IDs [38, 20]. But all that changed in 2012 when AlexNet won the ImageNet competition by a large margin using a technique called deep learning [22]. Deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks, use a cascade of multiple layers of processing units for feature extraction and transformation. They learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction. The levels form a hierarchy of concepts, showing strong invariance to the face pose, lighting, and expression changes, as shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen from the figure that the first layer of the deep neural network is somewhat similar to the Gabor feature found by human scientists with years of experience. The second layer learns more complex texture features. The features of the third layer are more complex, and some simple structures have begun to appear, such as high-bridged nose and big eyes. In the fourth, the network output is enough to explain a certain facial attribute, which can make a special response to some clear abstract concepts such as smile, roar, and even blue eye. In conclusion, in deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), the lower layers automatically learn the features similar to Gabor and SIFT designed for years or even decades (such as initial layers in Fig. 2), and the higher layers further learn higher level abstraction. Finally, the combination of these higher level abstraction represents facial identity with unprecedented stability. 3D FR has inherent advantages over 2D methods, but 3D deep FR is not well developed due to the lack of large annotated 3D data. To enlarge 3D training datasets, most works use the methods of “one-to-many augmentation” to synthesize 3D faces. However, the effective methods for extracting deep features of 3D faces remain to be explored. Kim et al. [204] fine-tuned a 2D CNN with a small amount of 3D scans for 3D FR. Zulqarnain et al. [259] used a three-channel (corresponding to depth, azimuth and elevation angles of the normal vector) image as input and minimized the average prediction log-loss. Zhang et al. [260] first selected 30 feature points from the Candide-3 face model to characterize faces, then conducted the unsupervised pretraining of face depth data, and finally performed the supervised fine-tuning."
What are some challenges that researchers have encountered when generating 3D face images from 2D images?,Yes,"The paper mainly talks about research on 3D face data reconstruction in terms of ""one-to-many augmentation"" methods. Also, attempts to enlarge 3D face datasets with the same method are mentioned. However, no challenges or specific issues during the process of 3D face reconstruction are included in the paper.","3D model. 3D face reconstruction is also a way to enrich the diversity of training data.

"What are the main differences between the large-scale training datasets MS-Celeb-1M, VGGface2, and Megaface in terms of depth versus breadth, long tail distribution, and data engineering practices?	",YES,"In terms of depth vs breadth, VGGFace2 stands as the dataset with the most depth among the 3. Although it contains a smaller number of subjects, it includes a large number of images per subject. It lets models focus on intra-class variations such as lighting, age, pose, etc. On the other hand, MS-Celeb-1M and Megface are datasets of breadth, in other words, they contain a lot of subjects but not particularly many images per subject. They let models cover sufficiently different appearances of different people. In terms of long tail distribution, VGGFace2 uses the head part of the distribution, Megaface uses the entire distribution to have as many images as possible, and different challenges of MS-Celeb-1M use the central or long tail part of the distribution. In terms of data engineering, the Megaface and MS-Celeb-1M datasets are usually filtered and cleaned to increase the performance of trained models. However, the leaders in this aspect are industry companies that hold computational capacity and data.","Depth v.s. breadth. These large training sets are expanded from depth or breadth. VGGface2 provides a large-scale training dataset of depth, which have limited number of subjects but many images for each subjects. The depth of dataset enforces the trained model to address a wide range intra-class variations, such as lighting, age, and pose. In contrast, MS-Celeb-1M and Mageface (Challenge 2) offers large-scale training datasets of breadth, which contains many subject but limited images for each subjects. The breadth of dataset ensures the trained model to cover the sufficiently variable appearance of various people. Cao et al. [39] conducted a systematic studies on model training using VGGface2 and MS-Celeb-1M, and found an optimal model by first training on MS-Celeb-1M (breadth) and then fine-tuning on VGGface2 (depth). Long tail distribution. The utilization of long tail distribution is different among datasets. For example, in Challenge 2 of MS-Celeb-1M, the novel set specially uses the tailed data to study low-shot learning; central part of the long tail distribution is used by the Challenge 1 of MS-Celeb-1M and images’ number is approximately limited to 100 for each celebrity; VGGface and VGGface2 only use the head part to construct deep databases; Megaface utilizes the whole distribution to contain as many images as possible, the minimal number of images is 3 per person and the maximum is 2469. Data engineering. Several popular benchmarks, such as LFW unrestricted protocol, Megaface Challenge 1, MS-Celeb-1M Challenge 1&2, explicitly encourage researchers to collect and clean a large-scale data set for enhancing the capability of deep neural network. Although data engineering is a valuable problem to computer vision researchers, this protocol is more incline to the industry participants. As evidence, the leaderboards of these experiments are mostly occupied by the companies holding invincible hardwares and data scales. This phenomenon may not be beneficial for developments of new models in academic community."
"What are some methods that have been proposed to address the security vulnerabilities of deep face recognition systems, such as presentation attacks and adversarial attacks?",To ensure 100% accuracy by forcing the sole head to perform full attention to compare each token to all others,"Despite some defense systems for face spoofing that use two-stream CNN, classification with CNN, and LSTM, there is still a presentation attack with a 3D model that can crack them. Also, since the root cause of adversarial perturbations is unclear, methods like detecting and removing vulnerable layers are insufficient. In order to mitigate all different types of FR attacks, continued research in this direction is necessary.","With the success of FR techniques, various types of attacks, such as face spoofing and adversarial perturbations, are becoming large threats. Face spoofing involves presenting a fake face to the biometric sensor using a printed photograph, worn mask, or even an image displayed on another electronic device. In order to defense this type of attack, several methods are proposed [211, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279]. Atoum et al. [211] proposed a novel two-stream CNN in which the local features discriminate the spoof patches that are independent of the spatial face areas, and holistic depth maps ensure that the input live sample has a face-like depth. Yang et al. [273] trained a CNN using both a single frame and multiple frames with five scales as input, and using the live/spoof label as the output. Taken the sequence of video frames as input, Xu et al. [274] applied LSTM units on top of CNN to obtain end-to-end features to recognize spoofing faces which leveraged the local and dense property from convolution operation and learned the temporal structure using LSTM units. Li et al. [275] and Patel et al. [276] fine-tuned their networks from a pretrained model by training sets of real and fake images. Jourabloo et al. [277] proposed to inversely decompose a spoof face into the live face and the spoof noise pattern. Adversarial perturbation is the other type of attack which can be defined as the addition of a minimal vector r such that with addition of this vector into the input image x, i.e. (x+r), the deep learning models misclassifies the input while people will not. Recently, more and more work has begun to focus on solving this perturbation of FR. Goswami et al. [280] proposed to detect adversarial samples by characterizing abnormal filter response behavior in the hidden layers and increase the network’s robustness by removing the most problematic filters. Goel et al. [281] provided an open source implementation of adversarial detection and mitigation algorithms. Despite of progresses of anti-attack algorithms, attack methods are updated as well and remind us the need to further increase security and robustness in FR systems, for example, Mai et al. [282] proposed a neighborly de-convolutional neural network (NbNet) to reconstruct a fake face using the stolen deep templates. •Security issues. Presentation attack [289], adversarial attack [280, 281, 290], template attack [291] and digital manipulation attack [292, 293] are developing to threaten the security of deep face recognition systems. 1) Presentation attack with 3D silicone mask, which exhibits skin-like appearance and facial motion, challenges current anti-sproofing methods [294]. 2) Although adversarial perturbation detection and mitigation methods are recently proposed [280][281], the root cause of adversarial vulnerability is unclear and thus new types of adversarial attacks are still upgraded continuously [295, 296]. 3) The stolen deep feature template can be used to recover its facial appearance, and how to generate cancelable template without loss of accuracy is another important issue. 4) Digital manipulation attack, made feasible by GANs, can generate entirely or partially modified photorealistic faces by expression swap, identity swap, attribute manipulation and entire face synthesis, which remains a main challenge for the security of deep FR."
What are some common methods used in facial recognition and how do they compare in terms of effectiveness and challenges?,"Sure! Here's the answer to the question based on the provided context:

Overfitting due to large model size relative to small training data","There are broadly 4 methods that are used in FR. Holistic methods were the first-ever attempt to solve the FR problem. But they were too primitive and could not account for uncontrolled facial changes that did not fit its assumptions. Then, there are local feature-based methods that try to extract invariant properties with local filtering. However, although better than holistic methods, these are also short of complexity and capacity to address the vastness of facial appearances. The first learning-based methods also lacked the robustness to address the non-linearity and complexity of FR. Also, the efforts that were made in this direction were too scattered and there were no traditional methods that could address the FR problem entirely. Afterward, deep learning based methods were introduced which surpassed the human ability in FR. Unfortunately, these methods are prone to adversarial noises and need large datasets. In particular, designing bigger and bigger datasets is becoming a privacy issue, that is yet to be handled by deep FR models.","Face recognition (FR) has been the prominent biometric technique for identity authentication and has been widely used in many areas, such as military, finance, public security and daily life. FR has been a long-standing research topic in the CVPR community. In the early 1990s, the study of FR became popular following the introduction of the historical Eigenface approach [1]. The milestones of feature-based FR over the past years are presented in Fig. 1, in which the times of four major technical streams are highlighted. The holistic approaches derive the low-dimensional representation through certain distribution assumptions, such as linear subspace [2][3][4], manifold [5][6][7], and sparse representation [8][9][10][11]. This idea dominated the FR community in the 1990s and 2000s. However, a well-known problem is that these theoretically plausible holistic methods fail to address the uncontrolled facial changes that deviate from their prior assumptions. In the early 2000s, this problem gave rise to local-feature-based FR. Gabor [12] and LBP [13], as well as their multilevel and high-dimensional extensions [14][15][16], achieved robust performance through some invariant properties of local filtering. Unfortunately, handcrafted features suffered from a lack of distinctiveness and compactness. In the early 2010s, learning-based local descriptors were introduced to the FR community [17][18][19], in which local filters are learned for better distinctiveness and the encoding codebook is learned for better compactness. However, these shallow representations still have an inevitable limitation on robustness against the complex nonlinear facial appearance variations. In general, traditional methods attempted to recognize human face by one or two layer representations, such as filtering responses, histogram of the feature codes, or distribution of the dictionary atoms. The research community studied intensively to separately improve the preprocessing, local descriptors, and feature transformation, but these approaches improved FR accuracy slowly. What’s worse, most methods aimed to address one aspect of unconstrained facial changes only, such as lighting, pose, expression, or disguise. There was no any integrated technique to address these unconstrained challenges integrally. As a result, with continuous efforts of more than a decade, “shallow” methods only improved the accuracy of the LFW benchmark to about 95% [15], which indicates that “shallow” methods are insufficient to extract stable identity feature invariant to real-world changes. Due to the insufficiency of this technical, facial recognition systems were often reported with unstable performance or failures with countless false alarms in real-world applications. In 2014, DeepFace [20] achieved the SOTA accuracy on the famous LFW benchmark [23], approaching human performance on the unconstrained condition for the first time (DeepFace: 97.35% vs. Human: 97.53%), by training a 9-layer model on 4 million facial images. Inspired by this work, research focus has shifted to deep-learning-based approaches, and the accuracy was dramatically boosted to above 99.80% in just three years. Deep learning technique has reshaped the research landscape of FR in almost all aspects such as algorithm designs, training/test datasets, application scenarios and even the evaluation protocols. Therefore, it is of great significance to review the breakthrough and rapid development process in recent years. There have been several surveys on FR [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and its subdomains, and they mostly summarized and compared a diverse set of techniques related to a specific FR scene, such as illumination-invariant FR [29], 3D FR [28], pose-invariant FR [30][31]. Unfortunately, due to their earlier publication dates, none of them covered the deep learning methodology that is most successful nowadays. This survey focuses only on recognition problem, and one can refer to Ranjan et al. [32] for a brief review of a full deep FR pipeline with detection and alignment, or refer to Jin et al. [33] for a survey of face alignment. Specifically, the major contributions of this survey are as follows: Despite the high accuracy in the LFW [23] and Megaface [44, 164] benchmarks, the performance of FR models still hardly meets the requirements in real-world application. A conjecture in industry is made that results of generic deep models can be improved simply by collecting big datasets of the target scene. However, this holds only to a certain degree. More and more concerns on privacy may make the collection and human-annotation of face data become illegal in the future. Therefore, significant efforts have been paid to design excellent algorithms to address the specific problems with limited data in these realistic scenes. In this section, we present several special algorithms of FR. •Privacy-preserving face recognition. With the leakage of biological data, privacy concerns are raising nowadays. Facial images can predict not only demographic information such as gender, age, or race, but even the genetic information [297]. Recently, the pioneer works such as Semi-Adversarial Networks [298, 299, 285] have explored to generate a recognizable biometric templates that can hidden some of the private information presented in the facial images. Further research on the principles of visual cryptography, signal mixing and image perturbation to protect users’ privacy on stored face templates are essential for addressing public concern on privacy. •Understanding deep face recognition. Deep face recognition systems are now believed to surpass human performance in most scenarios [300]. There are also some interesting attempts to apply deep models to assist human operators for face verification [183][300]. Despite this progress, many fundamental questions are still open, such as what is the “identity capacity” of a deep representation [301]? Why deep neural networks, rather than humans, are easily fooled by adversarial samples? While bigger and bigger training dataset by itself cannot solve this problem, deeper understanding on these questions may help us to build robust applications in real world. Recently, a new benchmark called TALFW has been proposed to explore this issue [93]."
How does the contrastive loss function work in deep face recognition?,"The author uses K-mode instead of K-means because K-mode is more accurate for clustering categorical data, and it eliminates the restriction on numerical data while maintaining the efficacy of the K-mean pattern","In Euclidean space, contrastive loss, pulls together positive pairs and pushes apart negative pairs: \begin{split}\mathcal{L}=&y_{ij}max\left(0,\left\|f(x_{i})-f(x_{j})\right\|_{2}-\epsilon^{+}\right)\\&+(1-y_{ij})max\left(0,\epsilon^{-}-\left\|f(x_{i})-f(x_{j})\right\|_{2}\right)\end{split}(2)where y_{ij}=1 means x_{i} and x_{j} are matching samples and y_{ij}=0 means non-matching samples. f(\cdot) is the feature embedding, \epsilon^{+} and \epsilon^{-} control the margins of the matching and non-matching pairs respectively. However, the problem is that the margin parameters are difficult to choose.","Euclidean-distance-based loss is a metric learning method [118, 119] that embeds images into Euclidean space in which intra-variance is reduced and inter-variance is enlarged. The contrastive loss and the triplet loss are the commonly used loss functions. The contrastive loss [35, 21, 36, 61, 120] requires face image pairs, and then pulls together positive pairs and pushes apart negative pairs.\begin{split}\mathcal{L}=&y_{ij}max\left(0,\left\|f(x_{i})-f(x_{j})\right\|_{2}-\epsilon^{+}\right)\\&+(1-y_{ij})max\left(0,\epsilon^{-}-\left\|f(x_{i})-f(x_{j})\right\|_{2}\right)\end{split}(2)where y_{ij}=1 means x_{i} and x_{j} are matching samples and y_{ij}=0 means non-matching samples. f(\cdot) is the feature embedding, \epsilon^{+} and \epsilon^{-} control the margins of the matching and non-matching pairs respectively. DeepID2 [21] combined the face identification (softmax) and verification (contrastive loss) supervisory signals to learn a discriminative representation, and joint Bayesian (JB) was applied to obtain a robust embedding space. Extending from DeepID2 [21], DeepID2+ [35] increased the dimension of hidden representations and added supervision to early convolutional layers. DeepID3 [36] further introduced VGGNet and GoogleNet to their work. However, the main problem with the contrastive loss is that the margin parameters are often difficult to choose. Contrary to contrastive loss that considers the absolute distances of the matching pairs and non-matching pairs, triplet loss considers the relative difference of the distances between them. Along with FaceNet [38] proposed by Google, Triplet loss [38, 37, 81, 80, 58, 60] was introduced into FR. It requires the face triplets, and then it minimizes the distance between an anchor and a positive sample of the same identity and maximizes the distance between the anchor and a negative sample of a different identity. FaceNet made \left\|f(x_{i}^{a})-f(x_{i}^{p})\right\|_{2}^{2}+\alpha<-\left\|f(x_{i}^{a})-f(x_{i}^{n})\right\|_{2}^{2} using hard triplet face samples, where x_{i}^{a}, x_{i}^{p} and x_{i}^{n} are the anchor, positive and negative samples, respectively, \alpha is a margin and f(\cdot) represents a nonlinear transformation embedding an image into a feature space. Inspired by FaceNet [38], TPE [81] and TSE [80] learned a linear projection W to construct triplet loss. Other methods optimize deep models using both triplet loss and softmax loss [59, 58, 60, 121]. They first train networks with softmax and then fine-tune them with triplet loss."
How do angular/cosine-margin-based loss functions improve the separability of learned features in deep face recognition?	,STL stands for Single-Task Learning,"Angular/cosine-margin-based loss allows the separation of learned features with larger angular/cosine distance. When the bias is removed and the weights are normalized in softmax, the outcome only depends on the angle between the weight and the features. Based on the prior that the human face lies on a manifold, the angular/cosine-margin-based loss explicitly adds discriminative constraints on a hypersphere manifold.","In 2017, people had a deeper understanding of loss function in deep FR and thought that samples should be separated more strictly to avoid misclassifying the difficult samples. Angular/cosine-margin-based loss [104, 84, 105, 106, 108] is proposed to make learned features potentially separable with a larger angular/cosine distance. The decision boundary in softmax loss is \left(W_{1}-W_{2}\right)x+b_{1}-b_{2}=0, where x is feature vector, W_{i} and b_{i} are weights and bias in softmax loss, respectively. Liu et al. [104] reformulated the original softmax loss into a large-margin softmax (L-Softmax) loss. They constrain b_{1}=b_{2}=0, so the decision boundaries for class 1 and class 2 become \left\|x\right\|\left(\left\|W_{1}\right\|cos\left(m\theta_{1}\right)-\left\|W_{2}\right\|cos\left(\theta_{2}\right)\right)=0 and \left\|x\right\|\left(\left\|W_{1}\right\|\left\|W_{2}\right\|cos\left(\theta_{1}\right)-cos\left(m\theta_{2}\right)\right)=0, respectively, where m is a positive integer introducing an angular margin, and \theta_{i} is the angle between W_{i} and x. Due to the non-monotonicity of the cosine function, a piece-wise function is applied in L-softmax to guarantee the monotonicity. The loss function is defined as follows:\mathcal{L}_{i}=-log\left(\frac{e^{\left\|W_{yi}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|\varphi(\theta_{yi})}}{e^{\left\|W_{yi}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|\varphi(\theta_{yi})+\sum_{j\neq y_{i}}e^{\left\|W_{yi}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|cos(\theta_{j})}}}\right)(4)where\varphi(\theta)=(-1)^{k}cos(m\theta)-2k,\theta\in\left[\frac{k\pi}{m},\frac{(k+1)\pi}{m}\right](5)Considering that L-Softmax is difficult to converge, it is always combined with softmax loss to facilitate and ensure the convergence. Therefore, the loss function is changed into: f_{y_{i}}=\frac{\lambda\left\|W_{y_{i}}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|cos(\theta_{y_{i}})+\left\|W_{y_{i}}\right\|\left\|x_{i}\right\|\varphi(\theta_{y_{i}})}{1+\lambda}, where \lambda is a dynamic hyper-parameter. Based on L-Softmax, A-Softmax loss [84] further normalized the weight W by L2 norm (\left\|W\right\|=1) such that the normalized vector will lie on a hypersphere, and then the discriminative face features can be learned on a hypersphere manifold with an angular margin (Fig. 6). Liu et al. [108] introduced a deep hyperspherical convolution network (SphereNet) that adopts hyperspherical convolution as its basic convolution operator and is supervised by angular-margin-based loss. To overcome the optimization difficulty of L-Softmax and A-Softmax, which incorporate the angular margin in a multiplicative manner, ArcFace [106] and CosFace [105], AMS loss [107] respectively introduced an additive angular/cosine margin cos(\theta+m) and cos\theta-m. They are extremely easy to implement without tricky hyper-parameters \lambda, and are more clear and able to converge without the softmax supervision. The decision boundaries under the binary classification case are given in Table V. Based on large margin, FairLoss [122] and AdaptiveFace [123] further proposed to adjust the margins for different classes adaptively to address the problem of unbalanced data. Compared to Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss explicitly adds discriminative constraints on a hypershpere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that human face lies on a manifold. However, Wang et al. [124] showed that angular/cosine-margin-based loss can achieve better results on a clean dataset, but is vulnerable to noise and becomes worse than center loss and softmax in the high-noise region as shown in Fig. 7."
How does normalizing the features and weights in the softmax loss function improve the performance of deep face recognition systems?	,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Batch normalization is a technique used in deep learning to improve the stability and performance of neural networks, particularly in image classification tasks. It normalizes the inputs to each layer, helping the network learn more robust features and improve generalization","Normalizing the weights only can help angular/cosine-margin-based loss to make the learned features more discriminative, whereas normalizing only the learned features can help overcome the bias to the sample distribution of the softmax. Since L2-norms of learned features with softmax loss were observed to be reflective of the quality of the face, making all the features have the same L2-norm may help to give similar attention to all different qualities of samples. Lastly, normalizing both the weights and features has become a common method since it was proven necessary by Wang et al. It is difficult to give more specific reasons why normalizing helps softmax loss, as most of the explanations come from referenced papers.","In 2017, in addition to reformulating softmax loss into an angular/cosine-margin-based loss as mentioned above, some works tries to normalize the features and weights in loss functions to improve the model performance, which can be written as follows:\hat{W}=\frac{W}{\left\|W\right\|},\hat{x}=\alpha\frac{x}{\left\|x\right\|}(6)where \alpha is a scaling parameter, x is the learned feature vector, W is weight of last fully connected layer. Scaling x to a fixed radius \alpha is important, as Wang et al. [110] proved that normalizing both features and weights to 1 will make the softmax loss become trapped at a very high value on the training set. After that, the loss function, e.g. softmax, can be performed using the normalized features and weights.  Some papers [84, 108] first normalized the weights only and then added angular/cosine margin into loss functions to make the learned features be discriminative. In contrast, some works, such as [109, 111], adopted feature normalization only to overcome the bias to the sample distribution of the softmax. Based on the observation of [125] that the L2-norm of features learned using the softmax loss is informative of the quality of the face, L2-softmax [109] enforced all the features to have the same L2-norm by feature normalization such that similar attention is given to good quality frontal faces and blurry faces with extreme pose. Rather than scaling x to the parameter \alpha, Hasnat et al. [111] normalized features with \hat{x}=\frac{x-\mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^{2}}}, where \mu and \sigma^{2} are the mean and variance. Ring loss [117] encouraged the norm of samples being value R (a learned parameter) rather than explicit enforcing through a hard normalization operation. Moreover, normalizing both features and weights [110, 112, 115, 105, 106] has become a common strategy. Wang et al. [110] explained the necessity of this normalization operation from both analytic and geometric perspectives. After normalizing features and weights, CoCo loss [112] optimized the cosine distance among data features, and Hasnat et al. [115] used the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) mixture model as the theoretical basis to develop a novel vMF mixture loss and its corresponding vMF deep features."
What are some common metrics used to evaluate the performance of face recognition systems?,The authors of the instructions were the authors of the paper,"Common metrics that are used to evaluate the accuracy of FR models are: ROC, Acc. for face verification; rank-N and CMC curve for closed-set face identification, and DET curve for open-set face identification. Also, the metrics for the complexity and size of FR models are important. Lastly, the metrics that measure the age/gender/racial bias of the FR models are becoming necessary.","•We present a comparison and analysis on public available databases that are of vital importance for both model training and testing. Major FR benchmarks, such as LFW [23], IJB-A/B/C [41, 42, 43], Megaface [44], and MS-Celeb-1M [45], are reviewed and compared, in term of the four aspects: training methodology, evaluation tasks and metrics, and recognition scenes, which provides an useful reference for training and testing deep FR. In order to evaluate whether our deep models can solve the different problems of FR in real life, many testing datasets are designed to evaluate the models in different tasks, i.e. face verification, close-set face identification and open-set face identification. In either task, a set of known subjects is initially enrolled in the system (the gallery), and during testing, a new subject (the probe) is presented. Face verification computes one-to-one similarity between the gallery and probe to determine whether the two images are of the same subject, whereas face identification computes one-to-many similarity to determine the specific identity of a probe face. When the probe appears in the gallery identities, this is referred to as closed-set identification; when the probes include those who are not in the gallery, this is open-set identification. Face verification is relevant to access control systems, re-identification, and application independent evaluations of FR algorithms. It is classically measured using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and estimated mean accuracy (Acc). At a given threshold (the independent variable), ROC analysis measures the true accept rate (TAR), which is the fraction of genuine comparisons that correctly exceed the threshold, and the false accept rate (FAR), which is the fraction of impostor comparisons that incorrectly exceed the threshold. And Acc is a simplified metric introduced by LFW [23], which represents the percentage of correct classifications. With the development of deep FR, more accurate recognitions are required. Customers concern more about the TAR when FAR is kept in a very low rate in most security certification scenario. PaSC [179] reports TAR at a FAR of 10^{-2}; IJB-A [41] evaluates TAR at a FAR of 10^{-3}; Megaface [44, 164] focuses on TAR@10^{-6}FAR; especially, in MS-celeb-1M challenge 3 [163], TAR@10^{-9}FAR is reported. Close-set face identification is relevant to user driven searches (e.g., forensic identification), rank-N and cumulative match characteristic (CMC) is commonly used metrics in this scenario. Rank-N is based on what percentage of probe searches return the probe’s gallery mate within the top k rank-ordered results. The CMC curve reports the percentage of probes identified within a given rank (the independent variable). IJB-A/B/C [41, 42, 43] concern on the rank-1 and rank-5 recognition rate. The MegaFace challenge [44, 164] systematically evaluates rank-1 recognition rate function of increasing number of gallery distractors (going from 10 to 1 Million), the results of the SOTA evaluated on MegaFace challenge are listed in Table IX. Rather than rank-N and CMC, MS-Celeb-1M [45] further applies a precision-coverage curve to measure identification performance under a variable threshold t. The probe is rejected when its confidence score is lower than t. The algorithms are compared in term of what fraction of passed probes, i.e. coverage, with a high recognition precision, e.g. 95% or 99%, the results of the SOTA evaluated on MS-Celeb-1M challenge are listed in Table X. •Remaining challenges defined by non-saturated benchmark datasets. Three current major datasets, namely, MegaFace [44, 164] , MS-Celeb-1M [45] and IJB-A/B/C [41, 42, 43], are corresponding to large-scale FR with a very large number of candidates, low/one-shot FR and large pose-variance FR which will be the focus of research in the future. Although the SOTA algorithms can be over 99.9 percent accurate on LFW [23] and Megaface [44, 164] databases, fundamental challenges such as matching faces cross ages [181], poses [188], sensors, or styles still remain. For both datasets and algorithms, it is necessary to measure and address the racial/gender/age biases of deep FR in future research. •Pursuit of extreme accuracy and efficiency. Many killer-applications, such as watch-list surveillance or financial identity verification, require high matching accuracy at very low alarm rate, e.g. 10^{-9}. It is still a big challenge even with deep learning on massive training data. Meanwhile, deploying deep face recognition on mobile devices pursues the minimum size of feature representation and compressed deep network. It is of great significance for both industry and academic to explore this extreme face-recognition performance beyond human imagination. It is also exciting to constantly push the performance limits of the algorithm after it has already surpassed human. Open-set face identification is relevant to high throughput face search systems (e.g., de-duplication, watch list identification), where the recognition system should reject unknown/unseen subjects (probes who do not present in gallery) at test time. At present, there are very few databases covering the task of open-set FR. IJB-A/B/C [41], [42], [43] benchmarks introduce a decision error tradeoff (DET) curve to characterize the the false negative identification rate (FNIR) as function of the false positive identification rate (FPIR). FPIR measures what fraction of comparisons between probe templates and non-mate gallery templates result in a match score exceeding T . At the same time, FNIR measures what fraction of probe searches will fail to match a mated gallery template above a score of T . The algorithms are compared in term of the FNIR at a low FPIR, e.g. 1% or 10%, the results of the SOTA evaluated on IJB-A dataset as listed in Table XI."
"Can the methods of ""one-to-many augmentation"" like data augmentation and 3D face reconstruction effectively improve the performance of deep FR algorithms in terms of accuracy and diversity of training data?","Yes, the lower bound estimator obtained by reparameterizing the variational lower bound is differentiable","In terms of accuracy, the paper mentions a set of work done on assembled multi-input networks that used ""one-to-many augmentation"" methods to expand their dataset and achieve better results compared to individual networks. In terms of diversity, all data augmentation, 3D face reconstruction, autoencoders, and especially GANs were found to be effective in generating faces in certain poses, angles, with different expressions, etc.","Collecting a large database is extremely expensive and time consuming. The methods of “one-to-many augmentation” can mitigate the challenges of data collection, and they can be used to augment not only training data but also the gallery of test data. we categorized them into four classes: data augmentation, 3D model, autoencoder model and GAN model. Data augmentation. Common data augmentation methods consist of photometric transformations [75, 22] and geometric transformations, such as oversampling (multiple patches obtained by cropping at different scales) [22], mirroring [153], and rotating [154] the images. Recently, data augmentation has been widely used in deep FR algorithms [58, 59, 60, 35, 21, 36, 61, 62]. for example, Sun et al. [21] cropped 400 face patches varying in positions, scales, and color channels and mirrored the images. Liu et al. [58] generated seven overlapped image patches centered at different landmarks on the face region and trained them with seven CNNs with the same structure. 3D model. 3D face reconstruction is also a way to enrich the diversity of training data. They utilize 3D structure information to model the transformation between poses. 3D models first use 3D face data to obtain morphable displacement fields and then apply them to obtain 2D face data in different pose angles. There is a large number of papers about this domain, but we only focus on the 3D face reconstruction using deep methods or used for deep FR. In [47], Masi et al. generated face images with new intra-class facial appearance variations, including pose, shape and expression, and then trained a 19-layer VGGNet with both real and augmented data. Masi et al. [48] used generic 3D faces and rendered fixed views to reduce much of the computational effort. Richardson et al. [49] employed an iterative 3D CNN by using a secondary input channel to represent the previous network’s output as an image for reconstructing a 3D face as shown in Fig. 13. Dou et al. [51] used a multi-task CNN to divide 3D face reconstruction into neutral 3D reconstruction and expressive 3D reconstruction. Tran et al. [53] directly regressed 3D morphable face model (3DMM) [155] parameters from an input photo by a very deep CNN architecture. An et al. [156] synthesized face images with various poses and expressions using the 3DMM method, then reduced the gap between synthesized data and real data with the help of MMD. 2) Assembled Networks : Multi-input networks. In “one-to-many augmentation”, multiple images with variety are generated from one image in order to augment training data. Taken these multiple images as input, multiple networks are also assembled together to extract and combine features of different type of inputs, which can outperform an individual network. In [58], [59], [60], [99], [34], [21], [35], assembled networks are built after different face patches are cropped, and then different types of patches are fed into different sub-networks for representation extraction. By combining the results of subnetworks, the performance can be improved. Other papers [96], [95], [98] used assembled networks to recognize images. Autoencoder model. Rather than reconstructing 3D models from a 2D image and projecting it back into 2D images of different poses, autoencoder models can generate 2D target images directly. Taken a face image and a pose code encoding a target pose as input, an encoder first learns pose-invariant face representation, and then a decoder generates a face image with the same identity viewed at the target pose by using the pose-invariant representation and the pose code. For example, given the target pose codes, multi-view perceptron (MVP) [55] trained some deterministic hidden neurons to learn pose-invariant face representations, and simultaneously trained some random hidden neurons to capture pose features, then a decoder generated the target images by combining pose-invariant representations with pose features. As shown in Fig. 14, Yim et al. [157] and Qian et al. [158] introduced an auxiliary CNN to generate better images viewed at the target poses. First, an autoencoder generated the desired pose image, then the auxiliary CNN reconstructed the original input image back from the generated target image, which guarantees that the generated image is identity-preserving. In [65], two groups of units are embedded between encoder and decoder. The identity units remain unchanged and the rotation of images is achieved by taking actions to pose units at each time step. GAN model. In GAN models, a generator aims to fool a discriminator through generating images that resemble the real images, while the discriminator aims to discriminate the generated samples from the real ones. By this minimax game between generator and discriminator, GAN can successfully generate photo-realistic images with different poses. After using a 3D model to generate profile face images, DA-GAN [56] refined the images by a GAN, which combines prior knowledge of the data distribution and knowledge of faces (pose and identity perception loss). CVAE-GAN [159] combined a variational auto-encoder with a GAN for augmenting data, and took advantages of both statistic and pairwise feature matching to make the training process converge faster and more stably. In addition to synthesizing diverse faces from noise, some papers also explore to disentangle the identity and variation, and synthesize new faces by exchanging identity and variation from different people. In CG-GAN [160], a generator directly resolves each representation of input image into a variation code and an identity code and regroups these codes for cross-generating, simultaneously, a discriminator ensures the reality of generated images. Bao et al. [161] extracted identity representation of one input image and attribute representation of any other input face image, then synthesized new faces by recombining these representations. This work shows superior performance in generating realistic and identity preserving face images, even for identities outside the training dataset. Unlike previous methods that treat classifier as a spectator, FaceID-GAN [162] proposed a three-player GAN where the classifier cooperates together with the discriminator to compete with the generator from two different aspects, i.e. facial identity and image quality respectively."
"How has the evolution of network architectures in deep face recognition systems, such as the transition from AlexNet to ResNet and SENet, impacted the performance of these systems?	",Yes,"As deep FR models followed the footsteps of deep object classification network architectures the performance got better, training got more controllable, and models got deeper. It started with DeepFace which was based on AlexNet that achieved 97.35% on the LFW benchmark. Then came the FaceNet based on GoogleNet which achieved 99.63%. VGGFace with a procedure to collect the large-scale dataset on the web and using the VGGNet architecture reached 98.95%. SphereFace used ResNet to achieve 99.42% accuracy. After the new VGGFace2 dataset was introduced Cao et al. trained a SENet-based architecture to achieve the SOTA for several datasets.","Mainstream architectures. The commonly used network architectures of deep FR have always followed those of deep object classification and evolved from AlexNet to SENet rapidly. We present the most influential architectures of deep object classification and deep face recognition in chronological order 111The time we present is when the paper was published. in Fig. 8.  With the evolved architectures and advanced training techniques, such as batch normalization (BN), the network becomes deeper and the training becomes more controllable. Following these architectures in object classification, the networks in deep FR are also developed step by step, and the performance of deep FR is continually improving. We present these mainstream architectures of deep FR in Fig. 9. In 2014, DeepFace [20] was the first to use a nine-layer CNN with several locally connected layers. With 3D alignment for face processing, it reaches an accuracy of 97.35% on LFW. In 2015, FaceNet [38] used a large private dataset to train a GoogleNet. It adopted a triplet loss function based on triplets of roughly aligned matching/nonmatching face patches generated by a novel online triplet mining method and achieved good performance of 99.63%. In the same year, VGGface [37] designed a procedure to collect a large-scale dataset from the Internet. It trained the VGGNet on this dataset and then fine-tuned the networks via a triplet loss function similar to FaceNet. VGGface obtains an accuracy of 98.95%. In 2017, SphereFace [84] used a 64-layer ResNet architecture and proposed the angular softmax (A-Softmax) loss to learn discriminative face features with angular margin. It boosts the achieves to 99.42% on LFW. In the end of 2017, a new large-scale face dataset, namely VGGface2 [39], was introduced, which consists of large variations in pose, age, illumination, ethnicity and profession. Cao et al. first trained a SENet with MS-celeb-1M dataset [45] and then fine-tuned the model with VGGface2 [39], and achieved the SOTA performance on the IJB-A [41] and IJB-B [42]. In 2014, DeepFace [20] achieved the SOTA accuracy on the famous LFW benchmark [23], approaching human performance on the unconstrained condition for the first time (DeepFace: 97.35% vs. Human: 97.53%), by training a 9-layer model on 4 million facial images. Inspired by this work, research focus has shifted to deep-learning-based approaches, and the accuracy was dramatically boosted to above 99.80% in just three years. Deep learning technique has reshaped the research landscape of FR in almost all aspects such as algorithm designs, training/test datasets, application scenarios and even the evaluation protocols. Therefore, it is of great significance to review the breakthrough and rapid development process in recent years. There have been several surveys on FR [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and its subdomains, and they mostly summarized and compared a diverse set of techniques related to a specific FR scene, such as illumination-invariant FR [29], 3D FR [28], pose-invariant FR [30][31]. Unfortunately, due to their earlier publication dates, none of them covered the deep learning methodology that is most successful nowadays. This survey focuses only on recognition problem, and one can refer to Ranjan et al. [32] for a brief review of a full deep FR pipeline with detection and alignment, or refer to Jin et al. [33] for a survey of face alignment. Specifically, the major contributions of this survey are as follows:"
How do feature-based methods work in face recognition?,The method uses PatchGAN for its discriminator network because it has fewer parameters than a full-image discriminator and can work on arbitrarily-sized images in a fully convolutional fashion. This allows for more efficient training and better performance,The only feature-based method that is mentioned in the paper is the local-feature-based methods from the 2000s of Gabor and LBP that tried local filtering to extract invariant properties. But they were too rigid and lacked distinctiveness and compactness.,"Face recognition (FR) has been the prominent biometric technique for identity authentication and has been widely used in many areas, such as military, finance, public security and daily life. FR has been a long-standing research topic in the CVPR community. In the early 1990s, the study of FR became popular following the introduction of the historical Eigenface approach [1]. The milestones of feature-based FR over the past years are presented in Fig. 1, in which the times of four major technical streams are highlighted. The holistic approaches derive the low-dimensional representation through certain distribution assumptions, such as linear subspace [2][3][4], manifold [5][6][7], and sparse representation [8][9][10][11]. This idea dominated the FR community in the 1990s and 2000s. However, a well-known problem is that these theoretically plausible holistic methods fail to address the uncontrolled facial changes that deviate from their prior assumptions. In the early 2000s, this problem gave rise to local-feature-based FR. Gabor [12] and LBP [13], as well as their multilevel and high-dimensional extensions [14][15][16], achieved robust performance through some invariant properties of local filtering. Unfortunately, handcrafted features suffered from a lack of distinctiveness and compactness. In the early 2010s, learning-based local descriptors were introduced to the FR community [17][18][19], in which local filters are learned for better distinctiveness and the encoding codebook is learned for better compactness. However, these shallow representations still have an inevitable limitation on robustness against the complex nonlinear facial appearance variations."
Can adaptive-architecture networks be used in other tasks besides face recognition?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

GPT-Critic takes longer dialogue turns because it is trained to maximize success rate without considering dialogue turn","Adaptive-architecture networks have been successfully applied to various tasks like image classification, semantic segmentation, and more.","Adaptive-architecture networks. Considering that designing architectures manually by human experts are time-consuming and error-prone processes, there is growing interest in adaptive-architecture networks which can find well-performing architectures, e.g. the type of operation every layer executes (pooling, convolution, etc) and hyper-parameters associated with the operation (number of filters, kernel size and strides for a convolutional layer, etc), according to the specific requirements of training and testing data. Currently, neural architecture search (NAS) [130] is one of the promising methodologies, which has outperformed manually designed architectures on some tasks such as image classification [131] or semantic segmentation [132]. Zhu et al. [88] integrated NAS technology into face recognition. They used reinforcement learning [133] algorithm (policy gradient) to guide the controller network to train the optimal child architecture. Besides NAS, there are some other explorations to learn optimal architectures adaptively. For example, conditional convolutional neural network (c-CNN) [89] dynamically activated sets of kernels according to modalities of samples; Han et al. [90] proposed a novel contrastive convolution consisted of a trunk CNN and a kernel generator, which is beneficial owing to its dynamistic generation of contrastive kernels based on the pair of faces being compared."
What are the main loss functions that have been explored for improving deep FR methods and how have they evolved over time?,Yes,"There are 3 categories of loss functions for FR: Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss, and softmax loss variations. Initially, cross-entropy softmax loss was used, then some models tried using Euclidean-distance-based loss functions which started from contrastive loss and triplet loss. However, due to their instability, the center loss and its variants (range loss, center-invariant loss) were introduced. With a better understanding of loss functions for FR angular/cosine-margin-based loss functions were used. It began with a reformulation of a softmax loss called L-Softmax, later A-Softmax appeared which adopted the L-Softmax idea but tried normalizing the weights. Afterward, there were several improvements such as ArcFace, CosFace, and AMS which facilitated the convergence, while Fairloss and AdaptiveFace dealt with unbalanced data. Lastly, there are different variations of softmax that try to normalize the L2-norms (L2-softmax, Ring loss), the weights, the features, or both weights and features (CoCo loss and vMF mixture loss).","Inheriting from the object classification network such as AlexNet, the initial Deepface [20] and DeepID [34] adopted cross-entropy based softmax loss for feature learning. After that, people realized that the softmax loss is not sufficient by itself to learn discriminative features, and more researchers began to explore novel loss functions for enhanced generalization ability. This becomes the hottest research topic in deep FR research, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Before 2017, Euclidean-distance-based loss played an important role; In 2017, angular/cosine-margin-based loss as well as feature and weight normalization became popular. It should be noted that, although some loss functions share the similar basic idea, the new one is usually designed to facilitate the training procedure by easier parameter or sample selection. •A systematic review on the evolution of the network architectures and loss functions for deep FR is provided. Various loss functions are categorized into Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss and softmax loss and its variations. Both the mainstream network architectures, such as Deepface [20], DeepID series [34, 35, 21, 36], VGGFace [37], FaceNet [38], and VGGFace2 [39], and other architectures designed for FR are covered. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of deep FR from both data and algorithm aspects. For algorithms, mainstream and special network architectures are presented. Meanwhile, we categorize loss functions into Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss and variable softmax loss. For data, we summarize some commonly used datasets. Moreover, the methods of face processing are introduced and categorized as “one-to-many augmentation” and “many-to-one normalization”. Finally, the special scenes of deep FR, including video FR, 3D FR and cross-age FR, are briefly introduced. 1) Euclidean-distance-based Loss : Euclidean-distance-based loss is a metric learning method [118], [119] that embeds images into Euclidean space in which intra-variance is reduced and inter-variance is enlarged. The contrastive loss and the triplet loss are the commonly used loss functions. The contrastive loss [35], [21], [36], [61], [120] requires face image pairs, and then pulls together positive pairs and pushes apart negative pairs. L =yij max (0, ‖f (xi) − f (xj )‖2 − +) + (1 − yij )max (0, − − ‖f (xi) − f (xj )‖2 ) (2) where yij = 1 means xi and xj are matching samples and yij = 0 means non-matching samples. f (·) is the feature embedding, + and − control the margins of the matching and non-matching pairs respectively. DeepID2 [21] combined the face identification (softmax) and verification (contrastive loss) supervisory signals to learn a discriminative representation, and joint Bayesian (JB) was applied to obtain a robust embedding space. Extending from DeepID2 [21], DeepID2+ [35] increased the dimension of hidden representations and added supervision to early convolutional layers. DeepID3 [36] further introduced VGGNet and GoogleNet to their work. However, the main problem with the contrastive loss is that the margin parameters are often difficult to choose. Contrary to contrastive loss that considers the absolute distances of the matching pairs and non-matching pairs, triplet loss considers the relative difference of the distances between them. Along with FaceNet [38] proposed by Google, Triplet loss [38], [37], [81], [80], [58], [60] was introduced into FR. It requires the face triplets, and then it minimizes the distance between an anchor and a positive sample of the same identity and maximizes the distance between the anchor and a negative sample of a different identity. FaceNet made ‖f (xa i ) − f (xp i )‖2 2 + α < − ‖f (xa i ) − f (xn i )‖2 2 using hard triplet face samples, where xa i , xp i and xn i are the anchor, positive and negative samples, respectively, α is a margin and f (·) represents a nonlinear transformation embedding an image into a feature space. Inspired by FaceNet [38], TPE [81] and TSE [80] learned a linear projection W to construct triplet loss. Other methods optimize deep models using both triplet loss and softmax loss [59], [58], [60], [121]. They first train networks with softmax and then fine-tune them with triplet loss. However, the contrastive loss and triplet loss occasionally encounter training instability due to the selection of effective training samples, some paper begun to explore simple alternatives. Center loss [101] and its variants [82], [116], [102] are good choices for reducing intra-variance. The center loss [101] learned a center for each class and penalized the distances between the deep features and their corresponding class centers. This loss can be defined as follows: LC = 1 2 m∑ i=1 ‖xi − cyi ‖2 2 (3) where xi denotes the i-th deep feature belonging to the yi-th class and cyi denotes the yi-th class center of deep features. To handle the long-tailed data, a range loss [82], which is a variant of center loss, is used to minimize k greatest range’s harmonic mean values in one class and maximize the shortest interclass distance within one batch. Wu et al. [102] proposed a center-invariant loss that penalizes the difference between each center of classes. Deng et al. [116] selected the farthest intraclass samples and the nearest inter-class samples to compute a margin loss. However, the center loss and its variants suffer from massive GPU memory consumption on the classification layer, and prefer balanced and sufficient training data for each identity. 2) Angular/cosine-margin-based Loss : In 2017, people had a deeper understanding of loss function in deep FR and thought that samples should be separated more strictly to avoid misclassifying the difficult samples. Angular/cosine-margin-based loss [104], [84], [105], [106], [108] is proposed to make learned features potentially separable with a larger angular/cosine distance. The decision boundary in softmax loss is (W1 − W2) x + b1 − b2 = 0, where x is feature vector, Wi and bi are weights and bias in softmax loss, respectively. Liu et al. [104] reformulated the original softmax loss into a large-margin softmax (L-Softmax) loss. They constrain b1 = b2 = 0, so the decision boundaries for class 1 and class 2 become ‖x‖ (‖W1‖ cos (mθ1) − ‖W2‖ cos (θ2)) = 0 and ‖x‖ (‖W1‖ ‖W2‖ cos (θ1) − cos (mθ2)) = 0, respectively, where m is a positive integer introducing an angular margin, and θi is the angle between Wi and x. Due to the nonmonotonicity of the cosine function, a piece-wise function is applied in L-softmax to guarantee the monotonicity. The loss function is defined as follows: Li = −log ( e‖Wyi‖‖xi‖φ(θyi) e‖Wyi‖‖xi‖φ(θyi)+∑ j6 =yi e‖Wyi‖‖xi‖cos(θj ) ) (4) where φ(θ) = (−1)kcos(mθ) − 2k, θ ∈ [ kπ m , (k + 1)π m ] (5) Considering that L-Softmax is difficult to converge, it is always combined with softmax loss to facilitate and ensure the convergence. Therefore, the loss function is changed into: fyi = λ‖Wyi ‖‖xi‖cos(θyi )+‖Wyi ‖‖xi‖φ(θyi ) 1+λ , where λ is a dynamic hyper-parameter. Based on L-Softmax, A-Softmax loss [84] further normalized the weight W by L2 norm (‖W ‖ = 1) such that the normalized vector will lie on a hypersphere, and then the discriminative face features can be learned on a hypersphere manifold with an angular margin (Fig. 6). Liu et al. [108] introduced a deep hyperspherical convolution network (SphereNet) that adopts hyperspherical convolution as its basic convolution operator and is supervised by angular-margin-based loss. To overcome the optimization difficulty of L-Softmax and A-Softmax, which incorporate the angular margin in a multiplicative manner, ArcFace [106] and CosFace [105], AMS loss [107] respectively introduced an additive angular/cosine margin cos(θ + m) and cosθ − m. They are extremely easy to implement without tricky hyperparameters λ, and are more clear and able to converge without the softmax supervision. The decision boundaries under the binary classification case are given in Table V. Based on large margin, FairLoss [122] and AdaptiveFace [123] further proposed to adjust the margins for different classes adaptively to address the problem of unbalanced data. Compared to Euclidean-distance-based loss, angular/cosine-margin-based loss explicitly adds discriminative constraints on a hypershpere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that human face lies on a manifold. However, Wang et al. [124] showed that angular/cosine-margin-based loss can achieve better results on a clean dataset, but is vulnerable to noise and becomes worse than center loss and softmax in the high-noise region as shown in Fig. 7. 3) Softmax Loss and its Variations : In 2017, in addition to reformulating softmax loss into an angular/cosine-margin-based loss as mentioned above, some works tries to normalize the features and weights in loss functions to improve the model performance, which can be written as follows: ˆW = W ‖W ‖ , ˆx = α x ‖x‖ (6) where α is a scaling parameter, x is the learned feature vector, W is weight of last fully connected layer. Scaling x to a fixed radius α is important, as Wang et al. [110] proved that normalizing both features and weights to 1 will make the softmax loss become trapped at a very high value on the training set. After that, the loss function, e.g. softmax, can be performed using the normalized features and weights. Some papers [84], [108] first normalized the weights only and then added angular/cosine margin into loss functions to make the learned features be discriminative. In contrast, some works, such as [109], [111], adopted feature normalization only to overcome the bias to the sample distribution of the softmax. Based on the observation of [125] that the L2-norm of features learned using the softmax loss is informative of the quality of the face, L2-softmax [109] enforced all the features to have the same L2-norm by feature normalization such that similar attention is given to good quality frontal faces and blurry faces with extreme pose. Rather than scaling x to the parameter α, Hasnat et al. [111] normalized features with ˆx = x−μ√σ2 , where μ and σ2 are the mean and variance. Ring loss [117] encouraged the norm of samples being value R (a learned parameter) rather than explicit enforcing through a hard normalization operation. Moreover, normalizing both features and weights [110], [112], [115], [105], [106] has become a common strategy. Wang et al. [110] explained the necessity of this normalization operation from both analytic and geometric perspectives. After normalizing features and weights, CoCo loss [112] optimized the cosine distance among data features, and Hasnat et al. [115] used the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) mixture model as the theoretical basis to develop a novel vMF mixture loss and its corresponding vMF deep features."
What are some of the specific challenges that FR models face in real-world applications and how have researchers attempted to address these challenges through the design of specialized algorithms?	,"Yes, GMPool can be used with more recent GNN architectures such as GIN and Graph Transformers. While the paper only demonstrates the effectiveness of GMPool with DMPNN, the module-agnostic design of GMPool allows for its seamless integration with other GNN architectures. In fact, the authors mention that GMPool can be used with any GNN architecture as long as the architecture returns node representations as output. Therefore, it is possible to leverage more recent GNN architectures like GIN and Graph Transformers with GMPool to further improve the performance of graph pooling","Cross-pose FR is still a challenging problem for existing algorithms and over 10% decrease in accuracy was observed in frontal-frontal to frontal-profile verification. Techniques like DREAM and PIM were employed to perform frontalization in the deep face and learn pose-invariant representations. Cross-age FR is also a natural problem as facial appearance changes over time. There were attempts to synthesize images from the same age group with a generative probabilistic model and conditional GANs were used to generate an identity-preserved face with a target age. Further, local manifold adaptation (LMA) and pyramidal adversarial discriminator approaches were tried to deal with the imperfect preservation of identities of GAN-synthesized images. Alternatively, decomposing the identity and age from each other was another direction. Latent identity analysis (LIA) and decomposing in a spherical coordinate system are some methods from that direction. Lastly, CNN fine-tuning, siamese deep network, feature extraction, and deep learning with CNN were some of the notable approaches. Makeup FR is another real-world problem that needs a solution, as makeup can drastically change the appearance of the subject. Bi-level adversarial network (BLAN) was used to generate non makeup images from makeup images. Fine-tuning the triplet network with a small makeup dataset was another try. In particular, facial disguise is a big issue for FR as people can either want to hide their identity or impersonate another one. Identity hiding increases intra-class variation, while impersonation decreases inter-class distinction. Using DCNN and finding the transformation matrix with PCA for face disguise, fine-tuning models with disguised faces, hard example mining, and learning the representation of images in colors, shapes, and textures are some of the attempts to solve the issue. NIR-VIS FR is needed to match the NIS images, (near-infrared spectrum) that usually come from surveillance contexts to VIS (visible light spectrum) images, as most of the available datasets contain VIS images. Transferring from VIS to NIR with fine-tuning, transforming NIR images to VIS with CNN, using the siamese network for each VIS and NIR respectively, dividing the network into NIR, VIS, and NIR-VIS layers to learn modality-invariant features, embedding cross-spectral face hallucination and discriminative features, and low-rank relevance and cross-modal ranking are some of the methods that were used to solve the issue. Low-resolution FR needs addressing, although deep models are mostly robust to such cases. Mapping low and high-resolution faces into the same space with CNN, using face semantic information and local structural constraints to restore the shape and detail of the images are notable approaches in this direction. Photo-sketch FR can help find suspects effectively. Approaches usually either use transfer learning to directly match photos to sketches or perform image-to-image translation (image to sketch or sketch to an image). For the first type, training with images of faces and fine-tuning with sketches is one of the attempts. For the second type, branched fully convolution network (BFCN) and lately, GAN architectures were used to translate the image to sketch or vice versa. In many real-world scenarios low-shot FR is needed where only a few data points are available. Researchers tried to either synthesize more data or learn more meaningful features. 3D models, GANs, data augmentation, hybrid classifiers, and normalization are some of the attempts that were found useful. Using not only a single image but a set of data as the smallest unit matches many of the biometric scenarios. There are 2 types of methods in set/template-based FR, either processing all the data in the set separately to find the matching score by combining the individual scores with a certain function or doing feature pooling which generates a single representation of the set and compares only them. Additionally, a deep heterogeneous feature fusion network and actor-critic reinforcement learning are some of the alternative attempts to deal with sets/templates. Video FR is also a complex problem consisting of combining the data across frames and handling individual frames with blur, pose variations, and occlusions. A neural aggregation network (NAN), combining metric and adversarial learning is some of the attempts to aggregate the frames. To deal with bad frames: deep reinforcement learning, learning blur-robust representations, and reconstruction of frames with CNN was tried. 3D FR is underdeveloped due to a lack of good datasets. Despite attempts to enlarge such datasets with 3D reconstruction from 2D images, using 2D CNN, and using 3-channel inputs, the direction is still open for exploration. Partial Face Recognition is emerging in several real-world scenarios where a decision should be made with only a part of the face available. Dividing the aligned image into multi-scale patches and Dynamic Feature Matching (DFM) are some of the approaches for Partial FR. Applying FR in mobile devices is an important problem that needs a solution under stricter conditions. Deep models like MobiFace and the multi-batch method are some of the work in this direction. However, the light networks and compressing methods as in image classification still need exploration in the FR context. Face Anti-attack systems are needed to defend from face spoofing, adversarial perturbations, etc. For face spoofing, ensuring face-like depth with two-stream CNN, classification with CNN, and LSTM for sequences of frames were tried to resolve the issue. In terms of adversarial perturbation, detecting abnormal layers of the network to increase the robustness of the model was an idea. However, the attack methods evolve as well, thus continued work in this direction is necessary. Highly biased FR datasets impose fairness issues on FR models. Thus, debiasing attempts are made by unbalanced training, attribute removal, and domain adaptation. Unbalanced training, for example, RL-RBN,  tries to remove the bias of the model by regularization (i.e adjusting the objective function). The attribute-removal method tries to learn attribute-invariant representations by removing demographic information. Lastly, domain adaptation attempts to learn domain-invariant representations to avoid any domain bias.","Despite the high accuracy in the LFW [23] and Megaface [44, 164] benchmarks, the performance of FR models still hardly meets the requirements in real-world application. A conjecture in industry is made that results of generic deep models can be improved simply by collecting big datasets of the target scene. However, this holds only to a certain degree. More and more concerns on privacy may make the collection and human-annotation of face data become illegal in the future. Therefore, significant efforts have been paid to design excellent algorithms to address the specific problems with limited data in these realistic scenes. In this section, we present several special algorithms of FR. With the emergence of mobile phones, tablets and augmented reality, FR has been applied in mobile devices. Due to computational limitations, the recognition tasks in these devices need to be carried out in a light but timely fashion. MobiFace [87] required efficient memory and low cost operators by adopting fast downsampling and bottleneck residual block, and achieves99.7% on LFW database and 91.3% on Megaface database. Tadmor et al. [263] proposed a multibatch method that first generates signatures for a minibatch of k face images and then constructs an unbiased estimate of the full gradient by relying on all k^{2}-k pairs from the minibatch. As mentioned in Section 3.2.1, light-weight deep networks [126, 127, 128, 129] perform excellently in the fundamental tasks of image classification and deserve further attention in FR tasks. Moreover, some well-known compressed networks such as Pruning [264, 265, 266], BinaryNets [267, 268, 269, 270], Mimic Networks [271, 272], also have potential to be introduced into FR. 1) Cross-Pose Face Recognition: As [182] shows that many existing algorithms suffer a decrease of over 10% from frontal-frontal to frontal-profile verification, cross-pose FR is still an extremely challenging scene. In addition to the aforementioned methods, including “one-to-many augmentation”, “many-to-one normalization” and assembled networks (Section IV and III-B.2), there are some other algorithms designed for cross-pose FR. Considering the extra burden of above methods, Cao et al. [215] attempted to perform frontalization in the deep feature space rather than the image space. A deep residual equivariant mapping (DREAM) block dynamically added residuals to an input representation to transform a profile face to a frontal image. Chen et al. [216] proposed to combine feature extraction with multi-view subspace learning to simultaneously make features be more pose-robust and discriminative. Pose Invariant Model (PIM) [217] jointly performed face frontalization and learned pose invariant representations end-to-end to allow them to mutually boost each other, and further introduced unsupervised cross-domain adversarial training and a learning to learn strategy to provide high-fidelity frontal reference face images. 2) Cross-Age Face Recognition: Cross-age FR is extremely challenging due to the changes in facial appearance by the aging process over time. One direct approach is to synthesize the desired image with target age such that the recognition can be performed in the same age group. A generative probabilistic model was used by [218] to model the facial aging process at each short-term stage. The identity-preserved conditional generative adversarial networks (IPCGANs) [219] framework utilized a conditional-GAN to generate a face in which an identity-preserved module preserved the identity information and an age classifier forced the generated face with the target age. Antipov et al. [220] proposed to age faces by GAN, but the synthetic faces cannot be directly used for face verification due to its imperfect preservation of identities. Then, they used a local manifold adaptation (LMA) approach [221] to solve the problem of [220]. In [222], high-level age-specific features conveyed by the synthesized face are estimated by a pyramidal adversarial discriminator at multiple scales to generate more lifelike facial details. An alternative to address the cross-age problem is to decompose aging and identity components separately and extract age-invariant representations. Wen et al. [192] developed a latent identity analysis (LIA) layer to separate these two components, as shown in Fig. 22. In [193], age-invariant features were obtained by subtracting age-specific factors from the representations with the help of the age estimation task. In [124], face features are decomposed in the spherical coordinate system, in which the identity-related components are represented with angular coordinates and the age-related information is encoded with radial coordinate. Additionally, there are other methods designed for cross-age FR. For example, Bianco ett al. [223] and El et al. [224] fine-tuned the CNN to transfer knowledge across age. Wang et al. [225] proposed a siamese deep network to perform multi-task learning of FR and age estimation. Li et al. [226] integrated feature extraction and metric learning via a deep CNN. 3) Makeup Face Recognition: Makeup is widely used by the public today, but it also brings challenges for FR due to significant facial appearance changes. The research on matching makeup and nonmakeup face images is receiving increasing attention. Li et al. [208] generated nonmakeup images from makeup ones by a bi-level adversarial network (BLAN) and then used the synthesized nonmakeup images for verification as shown in Fig. 23. Sun et al. [227] pretrained a triplet network on videos and fine-tuned it on a small makeup datasets. Specially, facial disguise [214], [228], [229] is a challenging research topic in makeup face recognition. By using disguise accessories such as wigs, beard, hats, mustache, and heavy makeup, disguise introduces two variations: (i) when a person wants to obfuscate his/her own identity, and (ii) another individual impersonates someone else’s identity. Obfuscation increases intra-class variations whereas impersonation reduces the inter-class dissimilarity, thereby affecting face recognition/verification task. To address this issue, a variety of methods are proposed. Zhang et al. [230] first trained two DCNNs for generic face recognition and then used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to find the transformation matrix for disguised face recognition adaptation. Kohli et al. [231] finetuned models using disguised faces. Smirnov et al. [232] proposed a hard example mining method benefitted from class-wise (Doppelganger Mining [233]) and example-wise mining to learn useful deep embeddings for disguised face recognition. Suri et al. [234] learned the representations of images in terms of colors, shapes, and textures (COST) using an unsupervised dictionary learning method, and utilized the combination of COST features and CNN features to perform recognition. 1) NIR-VIS Face Recognition: Due to the excellent performance of the near-infrared spectrum (NIS) images under low-light scenarios, NIS images are widely applied in surveillance systems. Because most enrolled databases consist of visible light (VIS) spectrum images, how to recognize a NIR face from a gallery of VIS images has been a hot topic. Saxena et al. [235] and Liu et al. [236] transferred the VIS deep networks to the NIR domain by fine-tuning. Lezama et al. [237] used a VIS CNN to recognize NIR faces by transforming NIR images to VIS faces through cross-spectral hallucination and restoring a low-rank structure for features through low-rank embedding. Reale et al. [198] trained a VISNet (for visible images) and a NIRNet (for near-infrared images), and coupled their output features by creating a siamese network. He et al. [238], [239] divided the high layer of the network into a NIR layer, a VIS layer and a NIR-VIS shared layer, then, a modality-invariant feature can be learned by the NIR-VIS shared layer. Song et al. [240] embedded cross-spectral face hallucination and discriminative feature learning into an end-to-end adversarial network. In [196], the low-rank relevance and cross-modal ranking were used to alleviate the semantic gap. 2) Low-Resolution Face Recognition: Although deep networks are robust to low resolution to a great extent, there are still a few studies focused on promoting the performance of low-resolution FR. For example, Zangeneh et al. [241] proposed a CNN with a two-branch architecture (a super-resolution network and a feature extraction network) to map the high and low-resolution face images into a common space where the intra-person distance is smaller than the interperson distance. Shen et al. [242] exploited the face semantic information and local structural constraints to better restore the shape and detail of face images. In addition, they optimized the network with perceptual and adversarial losses to produce photo-realistic results. 3) Photo-Sketch Face Recognition: The photo-sketch FR may help law enforcement to quickly identify suspects. The commonly used methods can be categorized as two classes. One is to utilize transfer learning to directly match photos to sketches. Deep networks are first trained using a large face database of photos and are then fine-tuned using small sketch database [243], [244]. The other is to use the image-to-image translation, where the photo can be transformed to a sketch or the sketch to a photo; then, FR can be performed in one domain. Zhang et al. [200] developed a fully convolutional network with generative loss and a discriminative regularizer to transform photos to sketches. Zhang et al. [245] utilized a branched fully convolutional neural network (BFCN) to generate a structure-preserved sketch and a texture-preserved sketch, and then they fused them together via a probabilistic method. Recently, GANs have achieved impressive results in image generation. Yi et al. [246], Kim et al. [247] and Zhu et al. [248] used two generators, GA and GB , to generate sketches from photos and photos from sketches, respectively (Fig. 24). Based on [248], Wang et al. [202] proposed a multi-adversarial network to avoid artifacts by leveraging the implicit presence of feature maps of different resolutions in the generator subnetwork. Similar to photo-sketch FR, photocaricature FR is one kind of heterogenous FR scenes which is challenging and important to understanding of face perception. Huo et al. [213] built a large dataset of caricatures and photos, and provided several evaluation protocols and their baseline performances for comparison. 1) Low-Shot Face Recognition: For many practical applications, such as surveillance and security, the FR system should recognize persons with a very limited number of training samples or even with only one sample. The methods of low-shot learning can be categorized as 1) synthesizing training data and 2) learning more powerful features. Hong et al. [249] generated images in various poses using a 3D face model and adopted deep domain adaptation to handle other variations, such as blur, occlusion, and expression (Fig. 25). Choe et al. [250] used data augmentation methods and a GAN for pose transition and attribute boosting to increase the size of the training dataset. Wu et al. [176] proposed a framework with hybrid classifiers using a CNN and a nearest neighbor (NN) model. Guo et al. [143] made the norms of the weight vectors of the one-shot classes and the normal classes aligned to address the data imbalance problem. Cheng et al. [137] proposed an enforced softmax that contains optimal dropout, selective attenuation, L2 normalization and model-level optimization. Yin et al. [251] augmented feature space of low-shot classes by transferring the principal components from regular to low-shot classes to encourage the variance of low-shot classes to mimic that of regular classes. 2) Set/Template-Based Face Recognition: Different from traditional image-to-image recognition, set-to-set recognition takes a set (heterogeneous contents containing both images and videos) as the smallest unit of representation. This kind of setting does reflect the real-world biometric scenarios, thereby attracting a lot of attention. After learning face representations of media in each set, two strategies are generally adopted to perform set-to-set matching. One is to use these representations to perform pair-wise similarity comparison of two sets and aggregate the results into a single and final score by max score pooling [96], average score pooling [252] and its variations [253], [254]. The other strategy is feature pooling [96], [103], [81] which first aggregates face representations into a single representation for each set and then performs a comparison between two sets. In addition to the commonly used strategies, there are also some novel methods proposed for set/template-based FR. For example, Hayat et al. [255] proposed a deep heterogeneous feature fusion network to exploit the features’ complementary information generated by different CNNs. Liu et al. [256] introduced the actor-critic reinforcement learning for set-based FR. They casted the inner-set dependency modeling to a Markov decision process in the latent space, and trained a dependency-aware attention control agent to make attention control for each image in each step. 3) Video Face Recognition: There are two key issues in video FR: one is to integrate the information across different frames together to build a representation of the video face, and the other is to handle video frames with severe blur, pose variations, and occlusions. For frame aggregation, Yang et al. [83] proposed a neural aggregation network (NAN) in which the aggregation module, consisting of two attention blocks driven by a memory, produces a 128-dimensional vector representation (Fig. 26). Rao et al. [187] aggregated raw video frames directly by combining the idea of metric learning and adversarial learning. For dealing with bad frames, Rao et al. [185] discarded the bad frames by treating this operation as a Markov decision process and trained the attention model through a deep reinforcement learning framework. Ding et al. [257] artificially blurred clear images for training to learn blur-robust face representations. Parchami et al. [258] used a CNN to reconstruct a lower-quality video into a high-quality face. 1) 3D Face Recognition: 3D FR has inherent advantages over 2D methods, but 3D deep FR is not well developed due to the lack of large annotated 3D data. To enlarge 3D training datasets, most works use the methods of “one-to-many augmentation” to synthesize 3D faces. However, the effective methods for extracting deep features of 3D faces remain to be explored. Kim et al. [204] fine-tuned a 2D CNN with a small amount of 3D scans for 3D FR. Zulqarnain et al. [259] used a three-channel (corresponding to depth, azimuth and elevation angles of the normal vector) image as input and minimized the average prediction log-loss. Zhang et al. [260] first selected 30 feature points from the Candide-3 face model to characterize aces, then conducted the unsupervised pretraining of face depth data, and finally performed the supervised fine-tuning. 2) Partial Face Recognition: Partial FR, in which only arbitrary-size face patches are presented, has become an emerging problem with increasing requirements of identification from CCTV cameras and embedded vision systems in mobile devices, robots and smart home facilities. He et al. [261] divided the aligned face image into several multi-scale patches, and the dissimilarity between two partial face images is calculated as the weighted L2 distance between corresponding patches. Dynamic feature matching (DFM) [262] utilized a sliding window of the same size as the probe feature maps to decompose the gallery feature maps into several gallery sub-feature maps, and the similarity-guided constraint imposed on sparse representation classification (SRC) provides an alignment-free matching. 4) Face Anti-attack: With the success of FR techniques, various types of attacks, such as face spoofing and adversarial perturbations, are becoming large threats. Face spoofing involves presenting a fake face to the biometric sensor using a printed photograph, worn mask, or even an image displayed on another electronic device. In order to defense this type of attack, several methods are proposed [211], [273], [274], [275], [276], [277], [278], [279]. Atoum et al. [211] proposed a novel two-stream CNN in which the local features discriminate the spoof patches that are independent of the spatial face areas, and holistic depth maps ensure that the input live sample has a face-like depth. Yang et al. [273] trained a CNN using both a single frame and multiple frames with five scales as input, and using the live/spoof label as the output. Taken the sequence of video frames as input, Xu et al. [274] applied LSTM units on top of CNN to obtain end-to-end features to recognize spoofing faces which leveraged the local and dense property from convolution operation and learned the temporal structure using LSTM units. Li et al. [275] and Patel et al. [276] fine-tuned their networks from a pretrained model by training sets of real and fake images. Jourabloo et al. [277] proposed to inversely decompose a spoof face into the live face and the spoof noise pattern. Adversarial perturbation is the other type of attack which can be defined as the addition of a minimal vector r such that with addition of this vector into the input image x, i.e. (x + r), the deep learning models misclassifies the input while people will not. Recently, more and more work has begun to focus on solving this perturbation of FR. Goswami et al. [280] proposed to detect adversarial samples by characterizing abnormal filter response behavior in the hidden layers and increase the network’s robustness by removing the most problematic filters. Goel et al. [281] provided an open source implementation of adversarial detection and mitigation algorithms. Despite of progresses of anti-attack algorithms, attack methods are updated as well and remind us the need to further increase security and robustness in FR systems, for example, Mai et al. [282] proposed a neighborly deconvolutional neural network (NbNet) to reconstruct a fake face using the stolen deep templates. 5) Debiasing face recognition: As described in Section V-A, existing datasets are highly biased in terms of the distribution of demographic cohorts, which may dramatically impact the fairness of deep models. To address this issue, there are some works that seek to introduce fairness into face recognition and mitigate demographic bias, e,g. unbalanced-training [283], attribute removal [284], [285], [286] and domain adaptation [173], [287], [147]. 1) Unbalanced-training methods mitigate the bias via model regularization, taking into consideration of the fairness goal in the overall model objective function. For example, RL-RBN [283] formulated the process of finding the optimal margins for non-Caucasians as a Markov decision process and employed deep Q-learning to learn policies based on large margin loss. 2) Attribute removal methods confound or remove demographic information of faces to learn attribute-invariant representations. For example, Alvi et al. [284] applied a confusion loss to make a classifier fail to distinguish attributes of examples so that multiple spurious variations are removed from the feature representation. SensitiveNets [288] proposed to introduce sensitive information into triplet loss. They minimized the sensitive information, while maintaining distances between positive and negative embeddings. 3) Domain adaptation methods propose to investigate data bias problem from a domain adaptation point of view and attempt to design domain-invariant feature representations to mitigate bias across domains. IMAN [173] simultaneously aligned global distribution to decrease race gap at domain-level, and learned the discriminative target representations at cluster level. Kan [147] directly converted the Caucasian data to non-Caucasian domain in the image space with the help of sparse reconstruction coefficients learnt in the common subspace."
Is the segmented training data 2d or 3d ?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

The attention method contributed to word alignments by providing sharper local focus, as visualized in Figure 7, allowing the model to selectively attend to a subset of words and improve translation accuracy",V-Net is trained on the 3D MRI prostate volumes.,"Segmentation is a highly relevant task in medical image analysis.Automatic delineation of organs and structures of interest is often necessary to perform tasks such as visual augmentation [10], computer assisted diagnosis [12], interventions [20] and extraction of quantitative indices from images [1].In particular, since diagnostic and interventional imagery often consists of 3D images, being able to perform volumetric segmentations by taking into account the whole volume content at once, has a particular relevance.In this work, we aim to segment prostate MRI volumes. This is a challenging task due to the wide range of appearance the prostate can assume in different scans due to deformations and variations of the intensity distribution. Moreover, MRI volumes are often affected by artefacts and distortions due to field inhomogeneity. Prostate segmentation is nevertheless an important task having clinical relevance both during diagnosis, where the volume of the prostate needs to be assessed [13], and during treatment planning, where the estimate of the anatomical boundary needs to be accurate [4, 20]. Our CNN is trained end-to-end on a dataset of prostate scans in MRI. An example of the typical content of such volumes is shown in Figure 1. All the volumes processed by the network have fixed size of 128\times 128\times 64 voxels and a spatial resolution of 1\times 1\times 1.5 millimeters. We trained our method on 50 MRI volumes, and the relative manual ground truth annotation, obtained from the ”PROMISE2012” challenge dataset [7]. This dataset contains medical data acquired in different hospitals, using different equipment and different acquisition protocols. The data in this dataset is representative of the clinical variability and challenges encountered in clinical settings. As previously stated we massively augmented this dataset through random transformation performed in each training iteration, for each mini-batch fed to the network. The mini-batches used in our implementation contained two volumes each, mainly due to the high memory requirement of the model during training. We used a momentum of 0.99 and a initial learning rate of 0.0001 which decreases by one order of magnitude every 25K iterations. We tested V-Net on 30 MRI volumes depicting prostate whose ground truth annotation was secret. All the results reported in this section of the paper were obtained directly from the organisers of the challenge after submitting the segmentation obtained through our approach. The test set was representative of the clinical variability encountered in prostate scans in real clinical settings [7]. We presented and approach based on a volumetric convolutional neural network that performs segmentation of MRI prostate volumes in a fast and accurate manner. We introduced a novel objective function that we optimise during training based on the Dice overlap coefficient between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth annotation. Our Dice loss layer does not need sample re-weighting when the amount of background and foreground pixels is strongly unbalanced and is indicated for binary segmentation tasks. Although we inspired our architecture to the one proposed in [14], we divided it into stages that learn residuals and, as empirically observed, improve both results and convergence time. Future works will aim at segmenting volumes containing multiple regions in other modalities such as ultrasound and at higher resolutions by splitting the network over multiple GPUs. Fully convolutional network trained end-to-end were so far applied only to 2D images both in computer vision [11, 8] and microscopy image analysis [14]. These models, which served as an inspiration for our work, employed different network architectures and were trained to predict a segmentation mask, delineating the structures of interest, for the whole image. In [11] a pre-trained VGG network architecture [15] was used in conjunction with its mirrored, de-convolutional, equivalent to segment RGB images by leveraging the descriptive power of the features extracted by the innermost layer. In [8] three fully convolutional deep neural networks, pre-trained on a classification task, were refined to produce segmentations while in [14] a brand new CNN model, especially tailored to tackle biomedical image analysis problems in 2D, was proposed. In this work we present our approach to medical image segmentation that leverages the power of a fully convolutional neural networks, trained end-to-end, to process MRI volumes.Differently from other recent approaches we refrain from processing the input volumes slice-wise and we propose to use volumetric convolutions instead. We propose a novel objective function based on Dice coefficient maximisation, that we optimise during training.We demonstrate fast and accurate results on prostate MRI test volumes and we provide direct comparison with other methods which were evaluated on the same test data 111Detailed results available on http://promise12.grand-challenge.org/results/."
What is the difference between foreground and background voxels?,"By achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks without using multi-task finetuning or additional data, the author's results demonstrate the significance of the design decisions they made, which were previously overlooked in BERT's pretraining procedure",At the output of the V-Net foreground voxels represents the score for the anatomy and background voxels represents score for not having the anatomy at a region.,"The right portion of the network extracts features and expands the spatial support of the lower resolution feature maps in order to gather and assemble the necessary information to output a two channel volumetric segmentation. The two features maps computed by the very last convolutional layer, having 1\times 1\times 1 kernel size and producing outputs of the same size as the input volume, are converted to probabilistic segmentations of the foreground and background regions by applying soft-max voxelwise.After each stage of the right portion of the CNN, a de-convolution operation is employed in order increase the size of the inputs (Figure 3) followed by one to three convolutional layers involving half the number of 5\times 5\times 5 kernels employed in the previous layer. Similar to the left part of the network, also in this case we resort to learn residual functions in the convolutional stages. We report in Table 1 the receptive fields of each network layer, showing the fact that the innermost portion of our CNN already captures the content of the whole input volume. We believe that this characteristic is important during segmentation of poorly visible anatomy: the features computed in the deepest layer perceive the whole anatomy of interest at once, since they are computed from data having a spatial support much larger than the typical size of the anatomy we seek to delineate, and therefore impose global constraints. The network predictions, which consist of two volumes having the same resolution as the original input data, are processed through a soft-max layer which outputs the probability of each voxel to belong to foreground and to background. In medical volumes such as the ones we are processing in this work, it is not uncommon that the anatomy of interest occupies only a very small region of the scan. This often causes the learning process to get trapped in local minima of the loss function yielding a network whose predictions are strongly biased towards background. As a result the foreground region is often missing or only partially detected. Several previous approaches resorted to loss functions based on sample re-weighting where foreground regions are given more importance than background ones during learning. In this work we propose a novel objective function based on dice coefficient, which is a quantity ranging between 0 and 1 which we aim to maximise. The dice coefficient D between two binary volumes can be written asD=\frac{2\sum_{i}^{N}p_{i}g_{i}}{\sum_{i}^{N}p_{i}^{2}+\sum_{i}^{N}g_{i}^{2}} A Previously unseen MRI volume can be segmented by processing it in a feed-forward manner through the network. The output of the last convolutional layer, after soft-max, consists of a probability map for background and foreground. The voxels having higher probability (>0.5) to belong to the foreground than to the background are considered part of the anatomy. We tested V-Net on 30 MRI volumes depicting prostate whose ground truth annotation was secret. All the results reported in this section of the paper were obtained directly from the organisers of the challenge after submitting the segmentation obtained through our approach. The test set was representative of the clinical variability encountered in prostate scans in real clinical settings [7].

Does it have anything to do with the nature and complexity of data we are working with ?,"Yes, the condition includes text input. The text-conditioned video generation setting in this study employs a dataset of 10 million captioned videos, and the diffusion model is conditioned on captions in the form of BERT-large embeddings processed using attention pooling",In general MRI 3D volume data is complex. Prostate anomaly segmentation also makes the data in consideration unique.,"We report in Table 1 the receptive fields of each network layer, showing the fact that the innermost portion of our CNN already captures the content of the whole input volume. We believe that this characteristic is important during segmentation of poorly visible anatomy: the features computed in the deepest layer perceive the whole anatomy of interest at once, since they are computed from data having a spatial support much larger than the typical size of the anatomy we seek to delineate, and therefore impose global constraints.

All the volumes processed by the network have fixed size of 128\times 128\times 64 voxels and a spatial resolution of 1\times 1\times 1.5 millimeters. Annotated medical volumes are not easy to obtain due to the fact that one or more experts are required to manually trace a reliable ground truth annotation and that there is a cost associated with their acquisition. In this work we found necessary to augment the original training dataset in order to obtain robustness and increased precision on the test dataset. We tested V-Net on 30 MRI volumes depicting prostate whose ground truth annotation was secret.

"Going deep through network layers makes it harder to remember shallower local information, wouldn't that make segmentation harder?","Entity-level masking has several advantages over phrase-level masking, including:

* Better capture of long-range dependencies: By masking entire entities, the model can better capture the relationships between entities and their properties, leading to improved generalization and adaptability.
* More effective knowledge transfer: Entity-level masking allows the model to learn more explicit knowledge about entities and their relationships, which can be more effective in transferring knowledge to downstream tasks",Since non anatomy part has a much larger spatial support than the anatomy and As we move down the layers in a CNN the receptive field of the features increases therefore proposed CNN would work fine for the local information.,"Recent research in computer vision and pattern recognition has highlighted the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve challenging tasks such as classification, segmentation and object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performances.This success has been attributed to the ability of CNNs to learn a hierarchical representation of raw input data, without relying on handcrafted features.As the inputs are processed through the network layers, the level of abstraction of the resulting features increases.Shallower layers grasp local information while deeper layers use filters whose receptive fields are much broader that therefore capture global information [19]. We report in Table 1 the receptive fields of each network layer, showing the fact that the innermost portion of our CNN already captures the content of the whole input volume. We believe that this characteristic is important during segmentation of poorly visible anatomy: the features computed in the deepest layer perceive the whole anatomy of interest at once, since they are computed from data having a spatial support much larger than the typical size of the anatomy we seek to delineate, and therefore impose global constraints. CNNs have been recently used for medical image segmentation.Early approaches obtain anatomy delineation in images or volumes by performing patch-wise image classification. Such segmentations are obtained by only considering local context and therefore are prone to failure, especially in challenging modalities such as ultrasound, where a high number of mis-classified voxel are to be expected.Post-processing approaches such as connected components analysis normally yield no improvement and therefore, more recent works, propose to use the network predictions in combination with Markov random fields [6], voting strategies [9] or more traditional approaches such as level-sets [2].Patch-wise approaches also suffer from efficiency issues. When densely extracted patches are processed in a CNN, a high number of computations is redundant and therefore the total algorithm runtime is high. In this case, more efficient computational schemes can be adopted. Downsampling allows us to reduce the size of the signal presented as input and to increase the receptive field of the features being computed in subsequent network layers. Each of the stages of the left part of the network, computes a number of features which is two times higher than the one of the previous layer."
Why it is needed to have a two channel volumetric segmentation in the output?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

FashionMNIST",Two channel volumetric segmentation is used at the output to perform binary classification of foreground and background classes using soft-max. Each volume represent the logits for each class at each pixel location.,"Segmentation is a highly relevant task in medical image analysis.Automatic delineation of organs and structures of interest is often necessary to perform tasks such as visual augmentation [10], computer assisted diagnosis [12], interventions [20] and extraction of quantitative indices from images [1].In particular, since diagnostic and interventional imagery often consists of 3D images, being able to perform volumetric segmentations by taking into account the whole volume content at once, has a particular relevance.In this work, we aim to segment prostate MRI volumes. This is a challenging task due to the wide range of appearance the prostate can assume in different scans due to deformations and variations of the intensity distribution. Moreover, MRI volumes are often affected by artefacts and distortions due to field inhomogeneity. Prostate segmentation is nevertheless an important task having clinical relevance both during diagnosis, where the volume of the prostate needs to be assessed [13], and during treatment planning, where the estimate of the anatomical boundary needs to be accurate [4, 20]. The right portion of the network extracts features and expands the spatial support of the lower resolution feature maps in order to gather and assemble the necessary information to output a two channel volumetric segmentation. The two features maps computed by the very last convolutional layer, having 1\times 1\times 1 kernel size and producing outputs of the same size as the input volume, are converted to probabilistic segmentations of the foreground and background regions by applying soft-max voxelwise.After each stage of the right portion of the CNN, a de-convolution operation is employed in order increase the size of the inputs (Figure 3) followed by one to three convolutional layers involving half the number of 5\times 5\times 5 kernels employed in the previous layer. Similar to the left part of the network, also in this case we resort to learn residual functions in the convolutional stages. The network predictions, which consist of two volumes having the same resolution as the original input data, are processed through a soft-max layer which outputs the probability of each voxel to belong to foreground and to background. In medical volumes such as the ones we are processing in this work, it is not uncommon that the anatomy of interest occupies only a very small region of the scan. This often causes the learning process to get trapped in local minima of the loss function yielding a network whose predictions are strongly biased towards background. As a result the foreground region is often missing or only partially detected. Several previous approaches resorted to loss functions based on sample re-weighting where foreground regions are given more importance than background ones during learning. In this work we propose a novel objective function based on dice coefficient, which is a quantity ranging between 0 and 1 which we aim to maximise. The dice coefficient D between two binary volumes can be written asD=\frac{2\sum_{i}^{N}p_{i}g_{i}}{\sum_{i}^{N}p_{i}^{2}+\sum_{i}^{N}g_{i}^{2}} A Previously unseen MRI volume can be segmented by processing it in a feed-forward manner through the network. The output of the last convolutional layer, after soft-max, consists of a probability map for background and foreground. The voxels having higher probability (>0.5) to belong to the foreground than to the background are considered part of the anatomy."
"Is the increase in receptive field of the features being computed in subsequent network layers due to the downsampling mentioned by the authors, or is it the result of subsequent convolutions as the network goes deeper?","a kernel smoother is a way to modify the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture to also capture structural similarity between nodes, in addition to attributed similarity",The increase in receptive field of the features being computed in subsequent network layers is the result of convolutions layers as the network goes deeper?,"Recent research in computer vision and pattern recognition has highlighted the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve challenging tasks such as classification, segmentation and object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performances.This success has been attributed to the ability of CNNs to learn a hierarchical representation of raw input data, without relying on handcrafted features.As the inputs are processed through the network layers, the level of abstraction of the resulting features increases.Shallower layers grasp local information while deeper layers use filters whose receptive fields are much broader that therefore capture global information [19].

We believe that this characteristic is important during segmentation of poorly visible anatomy: the features computed in the deepest layer perceive the whole anatomy of interest at once, since they are computed from data having a spatial support much larger than the typical size of the anatomy we seek to delineate, and therefore impose global constraints. In Figure 2 we provide a schematic representation of our convolutional neural network.We perform convolutions aiming to both extract features from the data and, at the end of each stage, to reduce its resolution by using appropriate stride. The left part of the network consists of a compression path, while the right part decompresses the signal until its original size is reached. Convolutions are all applied with appropriate padding. The convolutions performed in each stage use volumetric kernels having size 5\times 5\times 5 voxels.As the data proceeds through different stages along the compression path, its resolution is reduced. This is performed through convolution with 2\times 2\times 2 voxels wide kernels applied with stride 2 (Figure 3). Since the second operation extracts features by considering only non overlapping 2\times 2\times 2 volume patches, the size of the resulting feature maps is halved.This strategy serves a similar purpose as pooling layers that, motivated by [16] and other works discouraging the use of max-pooling operations in CNNs, have been replaced in our approach by convolutional ones. Moreover, since the number of feature channels doubles at each stage of the compression path of the V-Net, and due to the formulation of the model as a residual network, we resort to these convolution operations to double the number of feature maps as we reduce their resolution. PReLu non linearities are applied throughout the network. Downsampling allows us to reduce the size of the signal presented as input and to increase the receptive field of the features being computed in subsequent network layers. Each of the stages of the left part of the network, computes a number of features which is two times higher than the one of the previous layer."
Do we really no longer need hand crafted feature in the ML life cycle?,The ratio of 1x1 filters in the total number of filters is e_{1x1}/(e_{1x1} + e_{3x3}),Deep Neural Networks such as CNNs are much better option than the handcrafted features for computer vision problem such as segmentation.,"Recent research in computer vision and pattern recognition has highlighted the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve challenging tasks such as classification, segmentation and object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performances.This success has been attributed to the ability of CNNs to learn a hierarchical representation of raw input data, without relying on handcrafted features.As the inputs are processed through the network layers, the level of abstraction of the resulting features increases.Shallower layers grasp local information while deeper layers use filters whose receptive fields are much broader that therefore capture global information [19].

Can we enclose all appearances of prostate MRI volumes?,"The unique design of SAT, which includes a subgraph structure extractor, allows for a formal study of the expressiveness of the output representations, demonstrating that the node representation from a structure-aware attention layer is at least as expressive as the subgraph representation given by the structure extractor",Due to the training/testing and augmentation on the diverse set of prostate scans all appearances of prostate can be encoded with V-Net.,"Our CNN is trained end-to-end on a dataset of prostate scans in MRI. An example of the typical content of such volumes is shown in Figure 1. All the volumes processed by the network have fixed size of 128\times 128\times 64 voxels and a spatial resolution of 1\times 1\times 1.5 millimeters. During every training iteration, we fed as input to the network randomly deformed versions of the training images by using a dense deformation field obtained through a 2\times 2\times 2 grid of control-points and B-spline interpolation. This augmentation has been performed ”on-the-fly”, prior to each optimisation iteration, in order to alleviate the otherwise excessive storage requirements. Additionally we vary the intensity distribution of the data by adapting, using histogram matching, the intensity distributions of the training volumes used in each iteration, to the ones of other randomly chosen scans belonging to the dataset. We trained our method on 50 MRI volumes, and the relative manual ground truth annotation, obtained from the ”PROMISE2012” challenge dataset [7]. This dataset contains medical data acquired in different hospitals, using different equipment and different acquisition protocols. The data in this dataset is representative of the clinical variability and challenges encountered in clinical settings. As previously stated we massively augmented this dataset through random transformation performed in each training iteration, for each mini-batch fed to the network. The mini-batches used in our implementation contained two volumes each, mainly due to the high memory requirement of the model during training. We used a momentum of 0.99 and a initial learning rate of 0.0001 which decreases by one order of magnitude every 25K iterations.

In this work we present our approach to medical image segmentation that leverages the power of a fully convolutional neural networks, trained end-to-end, to process MRI volumes.Differently from other recent approaches we refrain from processing the input volumes slice-wise and we propose to use volumetric convolutions instead. We propose a novel objective function based on Dice coefficient maximisation, that we optimise during training.We demonstrate fast and accurate results on prostate MRI test volumes and we provide direct comparison with other methods which were evaluated on the same test data 111Detailed results available on http://promise12.grand-challenge.org/results/."

What is meant by the author saying that replacing pooling layers with convolutional layers reduces the memory footprint during training? ,"Yes. Convolution and up-convolution are considered as the transform and its inverse, respectively","Replacement of pooling layers with convolution layers resulted in smaller memory footprint due to the fact that there is no need to map the output of pooling layers back to their inputs during back-propagation step of training,","Replacing pooling operations with convolutional ones results also to networks that, depending on the specific implementation, can have a smaller memory footprint during training, due to the fact that no switches mapping the output of pooling layers back to their inputs are needed for back-propagation, and that can be better understood and analysed [19] by applying only de-convolutions instead of un-pooling operations."
Does deconvolution and unpooling conduct the same goal in the network?,"The author states that R-GCNs can be understood under a differentiable message passing interpretation because the model can be viewed as a special case of a more general message passing framework, which allows for differentiable message passing between nodes in the graph",Yes the purpose of the de-convolution layer is to increase the size similar to un-pooling operation.,"The right portion of the network extracts features and expands the spatial support of the lower resolution feature maps in order to gather and assemble the necessary information to output a two channel volumetric segmentation.

Does using horizontal connections depend on the amount and complexity of the data wanted to be segmented?,Yes,"Yes, more complex data can be finely segmented by using horizontal connections in the CNN network.","Similarly to [14], we forward the features extracted from early stages of the left part of the CNN to the right part. This is schematically represented in Figure 2 by horizontal connections. In this way we gather fine grained detail that would be otherwise lost in the compression path and we improve the quality of the final contour prediction. We also observed that when these connections improve the convergence time of the model."
"Does the phrase ""data with larger spatial support than the typical size of the anatomy"" refer to feature maps with a larger number of channels than the input map at the deepest layer, or does it refer to something else?",No,Yes the phrase refer to feature maps with a larger number of channels than the input map at the deepest layer.

Is the v-net model used in other medical tasks or on another MRI data as a pretrained model? What are the results? ,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Decreasing the depth by 1 is better than other values because it results in the fewest number of inference calls to the LM per example, as shown in the figure. Specifically, for Depth-1, Lambada requires 3.8x fewer calls compared to other depths, and for Depth-5, it requires 11.8x fewer calls","Yes V-Net is tested as a pretrained model on 30 MRI volumes for which ground truth segmentation was hidden,",We tested V-Net on 30 MRI volumes depicting prostate whose ground truth annotation was secret.

Are the comparisons provided for the task enough to replace the consultant or doctor in such a critical field?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Increasing the embedding and projection size helps to improve the model's performance by providing more information to the model about the input data. This allows the model to learn more nuanced and complex patterns in the data, leading to better performance. However, increasing the embedding and projection size also increases the number of parameters in the model, which can be less desirable",Keeping in view the cost and expert requirements the doctors can only be replaced if the V-Net can be trained on sufficiently large dataset annotated by experts,Annotated medical volumes are not easy to obtain due to the fact that one or more experts are required to manually trace a reliable ground truth annotation and that there is a cost associated with their acquisition. In this work we found necessary to augment the original training dataset in order to obtain robustness and increased precision on the test dataset.
What is volumetric neural network?,They utilize fully-connected layers for in-network upsampling to learn dense prediction of images,A volumetric neural network works on the input of 3D volumes and uses 3D convolution filters.,"We presented and approach based on a volumetric convolutional neural network that performs segmentation of MRI prostate volumes in a fast and accurate manner. We introduced a novel objective function that we optimise during training based on the Dice overlap coefficient between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth annotation. Our Dice loss layer does not need sample re-weighting when the amount of background and foreground pixels is strongly unbalanced and is indicated for binary segmentation tasks. Although we inspired our architecture to the one proposed in [14], we divided it into stages that learn residuals and, as empirically observed, improve both results and convergence time. Future works will aim at segmenting volumes containing multiple regions in other modalities such as ultrasound and at higher resolutions by splitting the network over multiple GPUs."
"What are differences between  “warping error”, the “Rand error” and the “pixel error” ?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

YES.

Adding the third branch for object masking in Mask R-CNN results in better results compared to faster R-CNN, as shown in the table and discussed in the text","If both queries and documents are short, fine-granular interaction is not required. : it uses BERT to produce a single embedding vector for the query and another for the document, extracted from BERT’s [CLS] contextualized embedding and expanded through a linear layer to dimension 4096 (which equals N_{q}\times 128=32\times 128). Relevance is estimated as the inner product of the query’s and the document’s embeddings, which we found to perform better than cosine similarity for single-vector re-ranking.","The u-net (averaged over 7 rotated versions of the input data) achieves without any further pre- or postprocessing a warping error of 0.0003529 (the new best score, see Table 1) and a rand-error of 0.0382."
Is Data Augmentation always sufficient to support performance in the segmentation task? ,3,Performance of microscopy image segmentation task can be improved by using elastic deformation based segmentation.,"Data augmentation is essential to teach the network the desired invariance and robustness properties, when only few training samples are available. In case of microscopical images we primarily need shift and rotation invariance as well as robustness to deformations and gray value variations. Especially random elastic deformations of the training samples seem to be the key concept to train a segmentation network with very few annotated images.We generate smooth deformations using random displacement vectors on a coarse 3 by 3 grid. The displacements are sampled from a Gaussian distribution with 10 pixels standard deviation. Per-pixel displacements are then computed using bicubic interpolation. Drop-out layers at the end of the contracting path perform further implicit data augmentation. The u-net architecture achieves very good performance on very different biomedical segmentation applications. Thanks to data augmentation with elastic deformations, it only needs very few annotated images and has a very reasonable training time of only 10 hours on a NVidia Titan GPU (6 GB).We provide the full Caffe[6]-based implementation and the trained networks444U-net implementation, trained networks and supplementary material available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net. We are sure that the u-net architecture can be applied easily to many more tasks. As for our tasks there is very little training data available, we use excessive data augmentation by applying elastic deformations to the available training images. This allows the network to learn invariance to such deformations, without the need to see these transformations in the annotated image corpus. This is particularly important in biomedical segmentation, since deformation used to be the most common variation in tissue and realistic deformations can be simulated efficiently. The value of data augmentation for learning invariance has been shown in Dosovitskiy et al. [2] in the scope of unsupervised feature learning."
Is fast processing the only metric that we consider in segmentation?,"Sure! Here's the answer based on the given context:

POSITIVE CORRELATION","Other than the processing time, performance of the segmentation task is also measure by computing the warping error, Rand error and the pixel error from thresholded segmentation map and also by IOU metric.","We demonstrate the application of the u-net to three different segmentation tasks. The first task is the segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic recordings. An example of the data set and our obtained segmentation is displayed in Figure 2. We provide the full result as Supplementary Material. The data set is provided by the EM segmentation challenge [14] that was started at ISBI 2012 and is still open for new contributions. The training data is a set of 30 images (512x512 pixels) from serial section transmission electron microscopy of the Drosophila first instar larva ventral nerve cord (VNC). Each image comes with a corresponding fully annotated ground truth segmentation map for cells (white) and membranes (black). The test set is publicly available, but its segmentation maps are kept secret. An evaluation can be obtained by sending the predicted membrane probability map to the organizers. The evaluation is done by thresholding the map at 10 different levels and computation of the “warping error”, the “Rand error” and the “pixel error” [14]. Here we achieve an average IOU (“intersection over union”) of 92%, which is significantly better than the second best algorithm with 83% (see Table 2)."
Can we try to re-generate those unreachable images using recent methods to enhance medical tasks?,"View synthesis serves as a supervisory signal for training the depth and pose estimation CNNs, providing a way to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated depth and pose",unreachable images can be generated by using elastic deformation based augmentation methods.,"Data augmentation is essential to teach the network the desired invariance and robustness properties, when only few training samples are available.

Do Ciresan et al. treat each patch as a separated input in their previous approach in segmentation?,π = 0.01,Yes Ciresan et al approach treated segmentation of each patch differently.,"The typical use of convolutional networks is on classification tasks, where the output to an image is a single class label. However, in many visual tasks, especially in biomedical image processing, the desired output should include localization, i.e., a class label is supposed to be assigned to each pixel. Moreover, thousands of training images are usually beyond reach in biomedical tasks. Hence, Ciresan et al. [1] trained a network in a sliding-window setup to predict the class label of each pixel by providing a local region (patch) around that pixel as input. First, this network can localize. Secondly, the training data in terms of patches is much larger than the number of training images. The resulting network won the EM segmentation challenge at ISBI 2012 by a large margin. Obviously, the strategy in Ciresan et al. [1] has two drawbacks. First, it is quite slow because the network must be run separately for each patch, and there is a lot of redundancy due to overlapping patches.Secondly, there is a trade-off between localization accuracy and the use of context. Larger patches require more max-pooling layers that reduce the localization accuracy, while small patches allow the network to see only little context. More recent approaches [11, 4] proposed a classifier output that takes into account the features from multiple layers. Good localization and the use of context are possible at the same time."

What would happen to the model performance if we just use connections from earlier layers of contracting path while going deeper without upsampling to perform localization?,"The Optimus pre-training objectives and its information bottleneck approach differ from traditional VAEs used for image generation in several ways:

1. Latent vector injection: Optimus introduces two schemes to inject conditioning vectors into GPT-2 without re-training it, which is not a common practice in traditional VAEs.
2. Combining BERT/GPT-2: The design idea to combine existing PLMs for larger and complex models is a novel approach in Optimus, not typically seen in traditional VAEs.
3. Pre-training on massive datasets: Optimus demonstrates that pre-training on massive datasets can effectively reduce KL vanishing, whereas traditional VAEs often use smaller datasets.
4. IB perspective: Optimus provides a principled approach to balancing compactness and usability of learned representations from the perspective of information bottleneck, which is not a primary focus in traditional VAEs.

Overall, Optimus introduces several novel technical contributions and implications that differentiate it from traditional VAEs used for image generation",Model need to match the size of expansion path with the contacting path at each stage. Otherwise the localization performance would suffer.,"In this paper, we build upon a more elegant architecture, the so-called “fully convolutional network” [9]. We modify and extend this architecture such that it works with very few training images and yields more precise segmentations; see Figure 1. The main idea in [9] is to supplement a usual contracting network by successive layers, where pooling operators are replaced by upsampling operators. Hence, these layers increase the resolution of the output. In order to localize, high resolution features from the contracting path are combined with the upsampled output. A successive convolution layer can then learn to assemble a more precise output based on this information. One important modification in our architecture is that in the upsampling part we have also a large number of feature channels, which allow the network to propagate context information to higher resolution layers. As a consequence, the expansive path is more or less symmetric to the contracting path, and yields a u-shaped architecture. The network does not have any fully connected layers and only uses the valid part of each convolution, i.e., the segmentation map only contains the pixels, for which the full context is available in the input image. This strategy allows the seamless segmentation of arbitrarily large images by an overlap-tile strategy (see Figure 2). To predict the pixels in the border region of the image, the missing context is extrapolated by mirroring the input image. This tiling strategy is important to apply the network to large images, since otherwise the resolution would be limited by the GPU memory."
What happen to the pixels with no content in the segmentation map?,"Restricting self-attention to a window with size r can be useful for long-term dependencies by allowing the model to focus on a local neighborhood of the input sequence, reducing the maximum path length and computational complexity, while still capturing long-range dependencies within the window","There are no pixels without any content because for the pixels in the border region of the image, the missing context is extrapolated by mirroring the input image.","One important modification in our architecture is that in the upsampling part we have also a large number of feature channels, which allow the network to propagate context information to higher resolution layers.

This strategy allows the seamless segmentation of arbitrarily large images by an overlap-tile strategy (see Figure 2). To predict the pixels in the border region of the image, the missing context is extrapolated by mirroring the input image. This tiling strategy is important to apply the network to large images, since otherwise the resolution would be limited by the GPU memory."
What is the contribution that augmentation data with deformation adds to the overall performance?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

A ""Gram"" matrix is a matrix of Gramian determinants, which are used to compute the style representation of each layer in the network","U-Net achieves good performance, less training time and less memory by using deformation based data augmentation.","Data augmentation is essential to teach the network the desired invariance and robustness properties, when only few training samples are available. In case of microscopical images we primarily need shift and rotation invariance as well as robustness to deformations and gray value variations. Especially random elastic deformations of the training samples seem to be the key concept to train a segmentation network with very few annotated images.We generate smooth deformations using random displacement vectors on a coarse 3 by 3 grid. The displacements are sampled from a Gaussian distribution with 10 pixels standard deviation. Per-pixel displacements are then computed using bicubic interpolation. Drop-out layers at the end of the contracting path perform further implicit data augmentation. The u-net (averaged over 7 rotated versions of the input data) achieves without any further pre- or postprocessing a warping error of 0.0003529 (the new best score, see Table 1) and a rand-error of 0.0382. The u-net architecture achieves very good performance on very different biomedical segmentation applications. Thanks to data augmentation with elastic deformations, it only needs very few annotated images and has a very reasonable training time of only 10 hours on a NVidia Titan GPU (6 GB).We provide the full Caffe[6]-based implementation and the trained networks444U-net implementation, trained networks and supplementary material available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net. We are sure that the u-net architecture can be applied easily to many more tasks. As for our tasks there is very little training data available, we use excessive data augmentation by applying elastic deformations to the available training images. This allows the network to learn invariance to such deformations, without the need to see these transformations in the annotated image corpus. This is particularly important in biomedical segmentation, since deformation used to be the most common variation in tissue and realistic deformations can be simulated efficiently. The value of data augmentation for learning invariance has been shown in Dosovitskiy et al. [2] in the scope of unsupervised feature learning."
Is convolution and up-convolution considered as the transform and its inverse?,"PointNet is highly robust to small perturbation of input points and corruption through point insertion/deletion due to its sparse representation of shapes, which allows it to tolerate minor changes in the input data while maintaining its ability to accurately classify or segment objects",Ye up-convolution operation upsamples the feature resolution back to original and also reduces the number of feature channels.,"The network architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. It consists of a contracting path (left side) and an expansive path (right side). The contracting path follows the typical architecture of a convolutional network. It consists of the repeated application of two 3x3 convolutions (unpadded convolutions), each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a 2x2 max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling. At each downsampling step we double the number of feature channels. Every step in the expansive path consists of an upsampling of the feature map followed by a 2x2 convolution (“up-convolution”) that halves the number of feature channels, a concatenation with the correspondingly cropped feature map from the contracting path, and two 3x3 convolutions, each followed by a ReLU. The cropping is necessary due to the loss of border pixels in every convolution. At the final layer a 1x1 convolution is used to map each 64-component feature vector to the desired number of classes. In total the network has 23 convolutional layers."
Is the last 1*1 convolutional layer used because the task requires to output a map of segmentation?,No,Yes 1*1 last convolution layer helps to get desired number of classes for the segmentation map.,"The network architecture is illustrated in Figure 1.

Which gives better performance: using more than one image in the batch or larger input tiles with only one image in the batch ?,"By demonstrating the proper learning of the mask vector's intended role in image-to-image translations, specifically in synthesizing facial expressions of CelebA images using features learned from RaFD, and showing the failure of the model when a wrong mask vector is used",According to the experiments in the paper use of large tiles instead of large size is preferred which reduces the overhead and maximize the use of GPU memory.,"The input images and their corresponding segmentation maps are used to train the network with the stochastic gradient descent implementation of Caffe [6].Due to the unpadded convolutions, the output image is smaller than the input by a constant border width. To minimize the overhead and make maximum use of the GPU memory, we favor large input tiles over a large batch size and hence reduce the batch to a single image. Accordingly we use a high momentum (0.99) such that a large number of the previously seen training samples determine the update in the current optimization step."
"What is meant by ""differential interference contrast""?","The authors had confidence in adopting unsupervised learning techniques because of the success of unsupervised learning in the NLP domain, as demonstrated by the cited papers",Differential interference contrast (DIC)  is a microscopy technique which can be used to record HeLa cells.,"The second data set “DIC-HeLa”333Data set provided by Dr. Gert van Cappellen Erasmus Medical Center. Rotterdam. The Netherlands are HeLa cells on a flat glass recorded by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (see Figure 3, Figure 4c,d and Supp. Material). It contains 20 partially annotated training images. Here we achieve an average IOU of 77.5% which is significantly better than the second best algorithm with 46%."
"Is it correct that The separation border equation for a cell is meant majorly by critical nearer cells and classes and when these cells become more and more distant in the map, the boarder equation goes to the weight assigned to this class ?","Yes. Fast R-CNN is more than six times faster than some of the baseline models, as shown in the comparison of training time and testing rate in Table 4",Yes the loss function can handle the changes in distance between the cell.,"Another challenge in many cell segmentation tasks is the separation of touching objects of the same class; see Figure 3. To this end, we propose the use of a weighted loss, where the separating background labels between touching cells obtain a large weight in the loss function."
How can we learn the network to be invariant to gray value variations?,Pretraining data size,Data augmentation and drop-out layer can make the network invariant to gray value variations.,"Data augmentation is essential to teach the network the desired invariance and robustness properties, when only few training samples are available.

What is bicubic interpolation ?,"No, MaxSim may not suffice for capturing query-document relevance when a query term can be matched to multiple document terms",Bicubic interpolation is a method to estimate missing pixels in a grid.,"Data augmentation is essential to teach the network the desired invariance and robustness properties, when only few training samples are available.

What is electron microscopic recordings used for ?,"The authors verified that YOLO learns very general representations of objects by testing it on both natural images and artwork, and observing that it outperforms other top detection methods like DPM and R-CNN by a wide margin, indicating that YOLO has learned generalizable representations of objects",Electron microscopic recordings can be used to highlight neuronal structures.,"We demonstrate the application of the u-net to three different segmentation tasks. The first task is the segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic recordings. An example of the data set and our obtained segmentation is displayed in Figure 2. We provide the full result as Supplementary Material. The data set is provided by the EM segmentation challenge [14] that was started at ISBI 2012 and is still open for new contributions. The training data is a set of 30 images (512x512 pixels) from serial section transmission electron microscopy of the Drosophila first instar larva ventral nerve cord (VNC). Each image comes with a corresponding fully annotated ground truth segmentation map for cells (white) and membranes (black). The test set is publicly available, but its segmentation maps are kept secret. An evaluation can be obtained by sending the predicted membrane probability map to the organizers. The evaluation is done by thresholding the map at 10 different levels and computation of the “warping error”, the “Rand error” and the “pixel error” [14]."
Can we use U-Net architecture in self-driving car and providing a segmentation map for the scene around?,"Yes.

Instead of relying solely on pre-trained language models (PLMs), there are alternative approaches to constructing RE models that have shown promise. One such approach is to use knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) to represent entities and relations, as proposed in the paper ""Knowledge-Enhanced Neural Machine Translation with Multi-Source Training"" by Zhang et al. (2019). This approach has been shown to improve the performance of RE models on certain benchmarks. Additionally, other research has explored the use of multimodal features, such as images and text, to improve the accuracy of RE models",The paper only discuss the application of U-Net for the segmentation of biomedical images.,"The u-net architecture achieves very good performance on very different biomedical segmentation applications. Thanks to data augmentation with elastic deformations, it only needs very few annotated images and has a very reasonable training time of only 10 hours on a NVidia Titan GPU (6 GB).We provide the full Caffe[6]-based implementation and the trained networks444U-net implementation, trained networks and supplementary material available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net. We are sure that the u-net architecture can be applied easily to many more tasks."
What performance metric does IOU measure?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Yes",The IOU measures the overlap between the ground-truth RoI and the RoI detected by the model.,"With pre-computed region proposals, it is easy to end-to-end train the R-FCN architecture. Following [6], our loss function defined on each RoI is the summation of the cross-entropy loss and the box regression loss: L(s,t(x,y,w,h)) = Lcls(sc∗ ) + λ[c∗ > 0]Lreg(t, t∗). Here c∗ is the RoI’s ground-truth label (c∗ = 0 means background). Lcls(sc∗ ) = − log(sc∗) is the cross-entropy loss for classification, Lreg is the bounding box regression loss as defined in [6], and t∗ represents the ground truth box. [c∗ > 0] is an indicator which equals to 1 if the argument is true and 0 otherwise. We set the balance weight λ = 1 as in [6]. We define positive examples as the RoIs that have intersection-over-union (IoU) overlap with a ground-truth box of at least 0.5, and negative otherwise."
Is Faster R-CNN +++ another different architecture or just some refinement for the known models?,"Sure! Here's the answer to the question at the end of the context:

The author's motivation to create the CC-News dataset is to gather as much data as possible for experimentation, in order to match the overall quality and quantity of data used in other studies that have trained on larger and more diverse datasets than the original BERT","Faster R-CNN+++ is a refined model of Faster R-CNN. Faster R-CNN+++ uses iterative box regression, context and multi-scale training to refine the original model.","Table 5 shows more comparisons. Following the multi-scale training in [8], we resize the image in each training iteration such that the scale is randomly sampled from {400,500,600,700,800} pixels. We still test a single scale of 600 pixels, so add no test-time cost. The mAP is 80.5%. In addition, we train our model on the MS COCO [13] trainval set and then fine-tune it on the PASCAL VOC set. R-FCN achieves 83.6% mAP (Table 5), close to the “Faster R-CNN +++” system in [9] that uses ResNet-101 as well. We note that our competitive result is obtained at a test speed of 0.17 seconds per image, 20\times faster than Faster R-CNN +++ that takes 3.36 seconds as it further incorporates iterative box regression, context, and multi-scale testing [9].These comparisons are also observed on the PASCAL VOC 2012 test set (Table 5)."
Why was R-FCN unable to converge using only one score map?,"Realistic samples are samples that have smooth deformations and preserve discriminative structures, unlike CDA which has discontinuous shapes and loses discriminative structures","R-FCN depends on the score maps of R-FCN for its output as the score maps are used for the rod pooling layer. Therefore, when the k = 1 and there is only one score map, RoIs don't actually capture any spatial information and therefore the model fails to learn the task.","In this paper, we develop a framework called Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) for object detection. Our network consists of shared, fully convolutional architectures as is the case of FCN [15]. To incorporate translation variance into FCN, we construct a set of position-sensitive score maps by using a bank of specialized convolutional layers as the FCN output. Each of these score maps encodes the position information with respect to a relative spatial position (e.g., “to the left of an object”). On top of this FCN, we append a position-sensitive RoI pooling layer that shepherds information from these score maps, with no weight (convolutional/fc) layers following. The entire architecture is learned end-to-end. All learnable layers are convolutional and shared on the entire image, yet encode spatial information required for object detection. Figure 1 illustrates the key idea and Table 1 compares the methodologies among region-based detectors. The importance of position-sensitivity is further demonstrated by setting k=1, for which R-FCN is unable to converge. In this degraded case, no spatial information can be explicitly captured within an RoI. Moreover, we report that naïve Faster R-CNN is able to converge if its RoI pooling output resolution is 1\times 1, but the mAP further drops by a large margin to 61.7% (Table 2). Given the proposal regions (RoIs), the R-FCN architecture is designed to classify the RoIs into object categories and background. In R-FCN, all learnable weight layers are convolutional and are computed on the entire image. The last convolutional layer produces a bank of k^{2} position-sensitive score maps for each category, and thus has a k^{2}(C+1)-channel output layer with C object categories (+1 for background). The bank of k^{2} score maps correspond to a k\times k spatial grid describing relative positions. For example, with k\times k=3\times 3, the 9 score maps encode the cases of {top-left, top-center, top-right, …, bottom-right} of an object category."
What was Faster R-CNN developed to overcome in the Fast R-CNN?,"No, the authors' proposed architecture cannot be replaced with newer model architectures such as attention-based models or transformers. The task is incompatible with these newer architectures","Faster R-CNN uses a RPN component to predict bounding boxes of objects it detects instead of sliding windows, which is what Fast R-CNN uses. From the names of the two models, it can be inferred that the change in methodology allowed Faster R-CNN to be more computationally efficient while still performing well.","There have been object detectors that can be thought of as “fully convolutional” models. OverFeat [21] detects objects by sliding multi-scale windows on the shared convolutional feature maps; similarly, in Fast R-CNN [6] and [12], sliding windows that replace region proposals are investigated. In these cases, one can recast a sliding window of a single scale as a single convolutional layer. The RPN component in Faster R-CNN [18] is a fully convolutional detector that predicts bounding boxes with respect to reference boxes (anchors) of multiple sizes. The original RPN is class-agnostic in [18], but its class-specific counterpart is applicable (see also [14]) as we evaluate in the following."
What is the hole algorithm?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Projected Attention Layers (PALs) work by injecting patterns back into the pre-trained transformer encoder through additional attention heads. These attention heads are projected onto the input sequence, allowing the model to focus on specific parts of the input when computing the attention weights. This allows the model to selectively focus on the patterns it has learned during training, and to use them to inform its attention when processing new input",The authors do not explain exactly what the hole algorithm is. It is implied that the hole algorithm is a trick that is used to try to improve performance by changing the stride and filters of convolutional layers.,"À trous and stride. Our fully convolutional architecture enjoys the benefits of the network modifications that are widely used by FCNs for semantic segmentation [15, 2]. Particularly, we reduce ResNet-101’s effective stride from 32 pixels to 16 pixels, increasing the score map resolution. All layers before and on the conv4 stage [9] (stride=16) are unchanged; the stride=2 operations in the first conv5 block is modified to have stride=1, and all convolutional filters on the conv5 stage are modified by the “hole algorithm” [15, 2] (“Algorithme à trous” [16]) to compensate for the reduced stride. For fair comparisons, the RPN is computed on top of the conv4 stage (that are shared with R-FCN), as is the case in [9] with Faster R-CNN, so the RPN is not affected by the à trous trick. The following table shows the ablation results of R-FCN (k\times k=7\times 7, no hard example mining). The à trous trick improves mAP by 2.6 points."

"What does ""non-maximum suppression"" mean?","Yes. The last 1x1 convolutional layer is used to output a map of segmentation, as the task requires",The authors do not explain exactly what non-maximum suppression is. It is implied that it is a common post-processing method that culls RoIs that have low IoU scores.,"Inference. As illustrated in Figure 2, the feature maps shared between RPN and R-FCN are computed (on an image with a single scale of 600). Then the RPN part proposes RoIs, on which the R-FCN part evaluates category-wise scores and regresses bounding boxes.During inference we evaluate 300 RoIs as in [18] for fair comparisons. The results are post-processed by non-maximum suppression (NMS) using a threshold of 0.3 IoU [7], as standard practice."
How can highest-loss examples be selected?,"The features of the SSD algorithm that contributed to major improvements in detection speed are:

1. Eliminating bounding box proposals and pixel resampling, which reduces computational cost and allows for faster processing.
2. Using a small convolutional filter to predict object categories and offsets in bounding box locations.
3. Using separate predictors (filters) for different aspect ratio detections.
4. Applying these filters to multiple feature maps from later stages of the network to perform detection at multiple scales","Losses are calculated individually for each RoI, then sorted. Then, only the losses of the RoIs chosen are used for backpropagation.","It is easy for our method to adopt online hard example mining (OHEM) [22] during training. Our negligible per-RoI computation enables nearly cost-free example mining. Assuming N proposals per image, in the forward pass, we evaluate the loss of all N proposals. Then we sort all RoIs (positive and negative) by loss and select B RoIs that have the highest loss. Backpropagation [11] is performed based on the selected examples. Because our per-RoI computation is negligible, the forward time is nearly not affected by N, in contrast to OHEM Fast R-CNN in [22] that may double training time. We provide comprehensive timing statistics in Table 5 in the next section."
"What does "" online hard example mining"" mean?","The authors claim that human feedback may be less important because their model, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}}, outperformed the original GPT3 model without human-generated data, despite the fact that InstructGPT, which had human-generated data, outperformed GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} on some tasks. The authors suggest that this suggests that the LMs are already familiar with language instructions from their pre-training and that human feedback may not be as crucial for instruction-tuning as previously thought","The authors do not explain exactly what OHEM is. From the provided explanation after OHEM, it seems that it involves only using specific outputs that satisfy a certain condition instead of all outputs for optimization during training.","It is easy for our method to adopt online hard example mining (OHEM) [22] during training. Our negligible per-RoI computation enables nearly cost-free example mining. Assuming N proposals per image, in the forward pass, we evaluate the loss of all N proposals.

What are the evidences that region-wise computations are of low cost ?,"Yes, GIN xu2018powerful is a GNN for heterogeneous graphs","As seen in Table 5, Faster R-CNN is 2.5 times slower than R-FCN when mining for 300 RoIs, and 6 times slower when mining for 2000 RoIs, proving that region-wise computations are of low cost.","Next we compare with standard “Faster R-CNN + ResNet-101” [9] which is the strongest competitor and the top-performer on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ImageNet benchmarks. We use k\times k=7\times 7 in the following.Table 5 shows the comparisons. Faster R-CNN evaluates a 10-layer subnetwork for each region to achieve good accuracy, but R-FCN has negligible per-region cost.With 300 RoIs at test time, Faster R-CNN takes 0.42s per image, 2.5\times slower than our R-FCN that takes 0.17s per image (on a K40 GPU; this number is 0.11s on a Titan X GPU). R-FCN also trains faster than Faster R-CNN.Moreover, hard example mining [22] adds no cost to R-FCN training (Table 5).It is feasible to train R-FCN when mining from 2000 RoIs, in which case Faster R-CNN is 6\times slower (2.9s vs. 0.46s). But experiments show that mining from a larger set of candidates (e.g., 2000) has no benefit (Table 5). So we use 300 RoIs for both training and inference in other parts of this paper."
What is the purpose of bounding box regression?,CNN architectures,Bounding box regression is needed to find the coordinates of the bounding boxes of the objects within the RoI.,"We further address bounding box regression [7, 6] in a similar way. Aside from the above k^{2}(C+1)-d convolutional layer, we append a sibling 4k^{2}-d convolutional layer for bounding box regression. The position-sensitive RoI pooling is performed on this bank of 4k^{2} maps, producing a 4k^{2}-d vector for each RoI. Then it is aggregated into a 4-d vector by average voting. This 4-d vector parameterizes a bounding box as t=(t_{x},t_{y},t_{w},t_{h}) following the parameterization in [6]. We note that we perform class-agnostic bounding box regression for simplicity, but the class-specific counterpart (i.e., with a 4k^{2}C-d output layer) is applicable."
"What is the difference between (x,y) possible pairs and number of pixels n in each bin?",Euclidean distance,"The number of possible pairs (x,y) is n, as (x,y) iterates through each pixel in the bin.","Position-sensitive score maps & Position-sensitive RoI pooling. To explicitly encode position information into each RoI, we divide each RoI rectangle into k\times k bins by a regular grid. For an RoI rectangle of a size w\times h, a bin is of a size \approx\frac{w}{k}\times\frac{h}{k} [8, 6].In our method, the last convolutional layer is constructed to produce k^{2} score maps for each category. Inside the (i,j)-th bin (0\leq i,j\leq k-1), we define a position-sensitive RoI pooling operation that pools only over the (i,j)-th score map:r_{c}(i,j\leavevmode\nobreak\ |\leavevmode\nobreak\ \Theta)=\sum_{(x,y)\in\text{bin}(i,j)}z_{i,j,c}(x+x_{0},y+y_{0}\leavevmode\nobreak\ |\leavevmode\nobreak\ \Theta)/n.(1)Here r_{c}(i,j) is the pooled response in the (i,j)-th bin for the c-th category, z_{i,j,c} is one score map out of the k^{2}(C+1) score maps, (x_{0},y_{0}) denotes the top-left corner of an RoI, n is the number of pixels in the bin, and \Theta denotes all learnable parameters of the network. The (i,j)-th bin spans \lfloor i\frac{w}{k}\rfloor\leq x<\lceil(i+1)\frac{w}{k}\rceil and \lfloor j\frac{h}{k}\rfloor\leq y<\lceil(j+1)\frac{h}{k}\rceil.The operation of Eqn.(1) is illustrated in Figure 1, where a color represents a pair of (i,j).Eqn.(1) performs average pooling (as we use throughout this paper), but max pooling can be conducted as well."
Does each channel maps the a response from a different position of the image ?,"Local Contrast Normalization (LCN) is a pre-processing technique used in computer vision tasks, particularly in semantic segmentation, that normalizes the contrast of an image or feature map locally to improve the performance of the model",The k^2 channels for each category C of the final convolutional layer each map to cells within a spatial grid that correspond to a position relative to an object.,"Visualization.In Figure 4 and 4 we visualize the position-sensitive score maps learned by R-FCN when k\times k=3\times 3. These specialized maps are expected to be strongly activated at a specific relative position of an object. For example, the “top-center-sensitive” score map exhibits high scores roughly near the top-center position of an object.If a candidate box precisely overlaps with a true object (Figure 4), most of the k^{2} bins in the RoI are strongly activated, and their voting leads to a high score. On the contrary, if a candidate box does not correctly overlaps with a true object (Figure 4), some of the k^{2} bins in the RoI are not activated, and the voting score is low. Given the proposal regions (RoIs), the R-FCN architecture is designed to classify the RoIs into object categories and background. In R-FCN, all learnable weight layers are convolutional and are computed on the entire image. The last convolutional layer produces a bank of k^{2} position-sensitive score maps for each category, and thus has a k^{2}(C+1)-channel output layer with C object categories (+1 for background). The bank of k^{2} score maps correspond to a k\times k spatial grid describing relative positions. For example, with k\times k=3\times 3, the 9 score maps encode the cases of {top-left, top-center, top-right, …, bottom-right} of an object category."
What are the benefits of selective pooling?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The presence of the KG-C adapter improves the test results by 0.4% on average","Selective pooling allows the model to learn position-sensitive score maps, which contain information crucial for learning. This can be seen from the k = 1 case, meaning there is only one score map and no spatial information is learned, where the model fails to converge. Selective pooling also changes the architecture in a way that there is no need for additional layers after the final RoI layer, which greatly decreases computation time.","The concept of position-sensitive score maps is partially inspired by [3] that develops FCNs for instance-level semantic segmentation.We further introduce the position-sensitive RoI pooling layer that shepherds learning of the score maps for object detection. There is no learnable layer after the RoI layer, enabling nearly cost-free region-wise computation and speeding up both training and inference. The importance of position-sensitivity is further demonstrated by setting k=1, for which R-FCN is unable to converge. In this degraded case, no spatial information can be explicitly captured within an RoI. Moreover, we report that naïve Faster R-CNN is able to converge if its RoI pooling output resolution is 1\times 1, but the mAP further drops by a large margin to 61.7% (Table 2). R-FCN ends with a position-sensitive RoI pooling layer. This layer aggregates the outputs of the last convolutional layer and generates scores for each RoI. Unlike [8, 6], our position-sensitive RoI layer conducts selective pooling, and each of the k\times k bin aggregates responses from only one score map out of the bank of k\times k score maps. With end-to-end training, this RoI layer shepherds the last convolutional layer to learn specialized position-sensitive score maps.Figure 1 illustrates this idea. Figure 4 and 4 visualize an example. The details are introduced as follows."
What's the reason for sharing features between R-FCN and RPN,"The problem is strictly convex because the objective function s(x) = P Ni xi log xi is strictly convex.

In other words, the Hessian matrix of the function is a diagonal matrix with positive elements, which ensures that the function is strictly convex","The feature maps contain information from the input image. The RPN uses those features to find RoIs, while the R-FCN uses those features to detect objects.","Inference. As illustrated in Figure 2, the feature maps shared between RPN and R-FCN are computed (on an image with a single scale of 600). Then the RPN part proposes RoIs, on which the R-FCN part evaluates category-wise scores and regresses bounding boxes.During inference we evaluate 300 RoIs as in [18] for fair comparisons. The results are post-processed by non-maximum suppression (NMS) using a threshold of 0.3 IoU [7], as standard practice."
Should we need to increase the size of the network to reach considerable efficiency after adding region-wise layers?,"Yes, the performance difference between Self-Instruct training and SuperNI training was significant. According to the results in Table 3, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} outperformed the models trained on SuperNI training set by a large margin, demonstrating the value of the generated data despite the noise. Additionally, compared to the GPT3 model fine-tuned with SuperNI training set, GPT3{}_{\textsc{Self-Inst}} achieved better performance on the newly created instruction set, leaving only a 5% gap behind \text{InstructGPT}_{\text{001}}","No, as seen by the model presented in the paper, performance can be maintained or even improved while keeping computational efficiency high and not adding region-wise layers.","In this paper, we develop a framework called Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) for object detection. Our network consists of shared, fully convolutional architectures as is the case of FCN [15]. To incorporate translation variance into FCN, we construct a set of position-sensitive score maps by using a bank of specialized convolutional layers as the FCN output. Each of these score maps encodes the position information with respect to a relative spatial position (e.g., “to the left of an object”). On top of this FCN, we append a position-sensitive RoI pooling layer that shepherds information from these score maps, with no weight (convolutional/fc) layers following. The entire architecture is learned end-to-end. All learnable layers are convolutional and shared on the entire image, yet encode spatial information required for object detection. Figure 1 illustrates the key idea and Table 1 compares the methodologies among region-based detectors. On the other hand, our R-FCN system has significantly better accuracy (Table 2). Its mAP (76.6%) is on par with the standard Faster R-CNN’s (76.4%, Table 5). These results indicate that our position-sensitive strategy manages to encode useful spatial information for locating objects, without using any learnable layer after RoI pooling. Next we compare with standard “Faster R-CNN + ResNet-101” [9] which is the strongest competitor and the top-performer on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ImageNet benchmarks. We use k\times k=7\times 7 in the following.Table 5 shows the comparisons. Faster R-CNN evaluates a 10-layer subnetwork for each region to achieve good accuracy, but R-FCN has negligible per-region cost.With 300 RoIs at test time, Faster R-CNN takes 0.42s per image, 2.5\times slower than our R-FCN that takes 0.17s per image (on a K40 GPU; this number is 0.11s on a Titan X GPU). R-FCN also trains faster than Faster R-CNN.Moreover, hard example mining [22] adds no cost to R-FCN training (Table 5).It is feasible to train R-FCN when mining from 2000 RoIs, in which case Faster R-CNN is 6\times slower (2.9s vs. 0.46s). But experiments show that mining from a larger set of candidates (e.g., 2000) has no benefit (Table 5). So we use 300 RoIs for both training and inference in other parts of this paper. We presented Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks, a simple but accurate and efficient framework for object detection. Our system naturally adopts the state-of-the-art image classification backbones, such as ResNets, that are by design fully convolutional. Our method achieves accuracy competitive with the Faster R-CNN counterpart, but is much faster during both training and inference."
"What do authors mean by saying that RoI layer was added ""unnaturally"" in the ResNet  ?","An example of a ""module"" in CNN is the Inception module, which is a building block composed of multiple convolutional layers with different fixed dimensions, such as 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, and 1x3, 3x1","Old object detection networks used two subnetworks, one being a convolutional subnetwork with a pooling layer, and another being fully connected layers. The pooling layer served as a RoI pooling layer. The authors imply that natural intuition for creating a fully convolutional network would be to get rid of the fully connected layers and just keep using the final pooling layer as the only layer in the RoI subnetwork. But in ResNet, the RoI subnetwork is actually in the middle of the network, which the authors deem to be unnatural.","A prevalent family [8, 6, 18] of deep networks for object detection can be divided into two subnetworks by the Region-of-Interest (RoI) pooling layer [6]: (i) a shared, “fully convolutional” subnetwork independent of RoIs, and (ii) an RoI-wise subnetwork that does not share computation. This decomposition [8] was historically resulted from the pioneering classification architectures, such as AlexNet [10] and VGG Nets [23], that consist of two subnetworks by design — a convolutional subnetwork ending with a spatial pooling layer, followed by several fully-connected (fc) layers. Thus the (last) spatial pooling layer in image classification networks is naturally turned into the RoI pooling layer in object detection networks [8, 6, 18]. But recent state-of-the-art image classification networks such as Residual Nets (ResNets) [9] and GoogLeNets [24, 26] are by design fully convolutional111Only the last layer is fully-connected, which is removed and replaced when fine-tuning for object detection.. By analogy, it appears natural to use all convolutional layers to construct the shared, convolutional subnetwork in the object detection architecture, leaving the RoI-wise subnetwork no hidden layer. However, as empirically investigated in this work, this naïve solution turns out to have considerably inferior detection accuracy that does not match the network’s superior classification accuracy. To remedy this issue, in the ResNet paper [9] the RoI pooling layer of the Faster R-CNN detector [18] is unnaturally inserted between two sets of convolutional layers — this creates a deeper RoI-wise subnetwork that improves accuracy, at the cost of lower speed due to the unshared per-RoI computation."
"How can one explain the statement ""inferior detection accuracy that does not match the network’s superior classification accuracy"" mentioned by the authors ?","The constraint value of δ and γ are separated because they serve different purposes in the training process. δ is gradually annealed from a generous bound of 8.0 at the beginning of training to a rather stringent bound of 1.0 towards the end of training, while γ is fixed to be 25.0. This allows the model to adapt to the constraints gradually, and avoids putting too much restriction on the model during training","The authors show in Table 2 that a naive implementation of Faster R-CNN, which used the methodology that the authors claimed to have inferior detection accuracy, actually does have inferior detection accuracy.","But recent state-of-the-art image classification networks such as Residual Nets (ResNets) [9] and GoogLeNets [24, 26] are by design fully convolutional111Only the last layer is fully-connected, which is removed and replaced when fine-tuning for object detection..

Analysis. Table 2 shows the results. We note that the standard (not naïve) Faster R-CNN in the ResNet paper [9] achieves 76.4% mAP with ResNet-101 (see also Table 5), which inserts the RoI pooling layer between conv4 and conv5 [9]. As a comparison, the naïve Faster R-CNN (that applies RoI pooling after conv5) has a drastically lower mAP of 68.9% (Table 2). This comparison empirically justifies the importance of respecting spatial information by inserting RoI pooling between layers for the Faster R-CNN system. Similar observations are reported in [19]. Naïve Faster R-CNN. As discussed in the introduction, one may use all convolutional layers in ResNet-101 to compute the shared feature maps, and adopt RoI pooling after the last convolutional layer (after conv5). An inexpensive 21-class fc layer is evaluated on each RoI (so this variant is “almost” fully convolutional). The à trous trick is used for fair comparisons."
Will these embeddings be based on measuring similarities between features of new faces and features extracted from faces which the model was trained on ?,"Stacking attention modules directly would lead to performance drop due to the degradation of features in deep layers caused by repeated dot production with mask ranges from zero to one, and the potential breakage of good properties of trunk branches, such as identical mapping of residual units. The attention residual learning mechanism is necessary to ease these problems by modifying the output of attention modules and using identical mapping to enhance feature contrast and reduce signal attenuation",FaceNet embeddings can be used to measure similarity between new faces and trained faces.,"In this paper we present a unified system for face verification (is this thesame person), recognition (who is this person) and clustering (find commonpeople among these faces). Our method is based on learning a Euclideanembedding per image using a deep convolutional network. The network is trainedsuch that the squared L2 distances in the embedding space directly correspond toface similarity: faces of the same person have small distances and faces ofdistinct people have large distances."
"What does ""online triplet mining method"" mean?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Wordpieces provide a good balance between flexibility and efficiency by offering a limited set of common sub-word units that can be used to represent words in a way that is more efficient than using characters alone, while still allowing for the flexibility of character-delimited models",Online triplet mining method generates two matching face thumbnails and a non-matching face thumbnail from the training data.,"In contrast to these approaches, FaceNet directly trains its output to be acompact 128-D embedding using a triplet-based loss function based onLMNN [19]. Our triplets consist of two matchingface thumbnails and a non-matching face thumbnail and the loss aims to separatethe positive pair from the negative by a distance margin. The thumbnails aretight crops of the face area, no 2D or 3D alignment, other than scale andtranslation is performed."
How could we recognize previously unseen person using k-NN?,adversarial loss,k-NN classification can be used to recognize the unseen faces by computing the distance between the FaceNet embeddings.,"Once this embedding has been produced, then the aforementioned tasks becomestraight-forward: face verification simply involves thresholding the distancebetween the two embeddings; recognition becomes a k-NN classification problem;and clustering can be achieved using off-the-shelf techniques such as k-meansor agglomerative clustering."
What does curriculum learning aim at ?,"Use a tokenizer to map character sequences to tokens, perform a rare-token lookup in the vocabulary to obtain a sequence of rare token identifiers, and then invert the vocabulary using a de-tokenizer to obtain a unique identifier",Curriculum learning is a method for good triplets selection.,"Choosing which triplets to use turnsout to be very important for achieving good performance and, inspired bycurriculum learning [1], we present a novel onlinenegative exemplar mining strategy which ensures consistently increasingdifficulty of triplets as the network trains. To improveclustering accuracy, we also explore hard-positive mining techniques whichencourage spherical clusters for the embeddings of a single person."
What do hard-positive mining techniques mean?,3N,Hard-positive mining techniques use spherical clusters for the embeddings of a single person.,"Choosing which triplets to use turnsout to be very important for achieving good performance and, inspired bycurriculum learning [1], we present a novel onlinenegative exemplar mining strategy which ensures consistently increasingdifficulty of triplets as the network trains. To improveclustering accuracy, we also explore hard-positive mining techniques whichencourage spherical clusters for the embeddings of a single person."
Does the inception model run different convolutions in parallel on cropped portions of the original images or on the same image?,TACKBP-2010 is a dataset used for evaluating entity linking systems,Inception model runs convolutions in parallel but it is not clear from paper that it runs on patches or complete image.,"In this paper we explore two different deep network architectures that havebeen recently used to great success in the computer vision community. Both aredeep convolutional networks [8, 11]. The firstarchitecture is based on the Zeiler&Fergus [22] model whichconsists of multiple interleaved layers of convolutions, non-linearactivations, local response normalizations, and max pooling layers. Weadditionally add several 1{\times}1{\times}d convolution layers inspired bythe work of [9]. The second architecture is based on theInception model of Szegedy et al. which was recently used as thewinning approach for ImageNet 2014 [16]. These networks usemixed layers that run several different convolutional and pooling layers inparallel and concatenate their responses. We have found that these models canreduce the number of parameters by up to 20 times and have the potential toreduce the number of FLOPS required for comparable performance."
"Could we consider ""randomly sampled negative faces added to each mini-batch"" as a mean of making the model more regularized against negative faces?","No.

The example you're referring to is not a hindrance to our intuition because the longer rule in that case provided a more general and comprehensive explanation for the fact check, even though the short rule was also valid. Our approach is not based on the length of the rules per se, but rather on the building blocks of solving the problem. The algorithm is designed to learn the most important building blocks and apply them as needed to solve the problem, regardless of their length",Model can be regularized against negative and poorly labeled faces by adding hard positive and negative examples in each mini-batch,"It is infeasible to compute the \operatorname{argmin} and \operatorname{argmax} across the wholetraining set. Additionally, it might lead to poor training, as mislabelled andpoorly imaged faces would dominate the hard positives and negatives.There are two obvious choices that avoid this issue:•Generate triplets offline every n steps, using the most recentnetwork checkpoint and computing the \operatorname{argmin} and \operatorname{argmax} on a subsetof the data.•Generate triplets online. This can be done by selecting the hardpositive/negative exemplars from within a mini-batch. To have a meaningful representation of the anchor-positive distances, it needsto be ensured that a minimal number of exemplars of any one identity is presentin each mini-batch. In our experiments we sample the training data such thataround 40 faces are selected per identity per mini-batch. Additionally, randomlysampled negative faces are added to each mini-batch."
Could the model just choose the embedding function to be zero just to overcome the very small distance that might occur in case of choosing the hardest negatives during triplet selection?,No,No the zero embeddings can result in a collapsed model.,"Selecting the hardest negatives can in practice lead to bad local minima early on intraining, specifically it can result in a collapsed model (i.e. f(x)=0). Inorder to mitigate this, it helps to select x_{i}^{n} such that\left\|f(x_{i}^{a})-f(x_{i}^{p})\right\|_{2}^{2}<\left\|f(x_{i}^{a})-f(x_{i}^{n})\right\|_{2}^{2}\;.(4)We call these negative exemplars semi-hard, as they are further awayfrom the anchor than the positive exemplar, but still hard because the squareddistance is close to the anchor-positive distance. Those negatives lie insidethe margin \alpha."
Why did the authors finetune the VAE on language understanding tasks?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the given context:

* Chopin and other Classical composers
* Composers from various eras of Western music (e.g. Baroque, Classical, Romantic)
* Non-Classical genres and composers (e.g. jazz, pop, rock)","The authors might be performing finetuning of the pretrained model and classifier weights to perform better on low resource language understanding tasks. However, the authors do explore two different methods - a feature-based method and a fine tune method, and it is not obvious if one is radically better than the other.","Due to the regularization term L R , OPTIMUS can organize sentences in the way specified by the prior distribution. For basic VAEs, a smooth feature space is learned, which is specifically beneficial for better generalization when the number of task-specific labeled data is low. To have a fair comparison, we follow the BERT paper, where the hidden feature of [CLS] is used as the sentence-level representation. In this way, the linear classifiers for both models have the same number of trainable parameters. Though the latent vector z is typically used as sentence-level representation in VAE literature, we argue that the KL regularization applied on z has a large impact on the preceding layer feature h [CLS] . Specifically, h [CLS] is fed into an linear classifier W C ∈ R K×H, where K is the number of classes, with objective − log(softmax(h [CLS] W C >  )). Two schemes are used: (i) Fine-tuning, where both the pre-trained model and the classifier are updated; (ii) Feature-based, where pre-trained model weights are frozen to provide embeddings for the classifier update."
How does training pre-training a latent space in Optimus lead to higher performance for dialog generation? Is it because the whole dialog can be encoded in the latent space?,"MIRA is similar to other clustering-based methods such as SwaV in that they both use clustering to learn representations, but MIRA differs in that it does not rely on artificial constraints such as equipartition, and instead uses mutual information regularization to maximize the mutual information between the pseudo-labels and the data","There is no information about dialog generation specifically, to explain if this outperformance by OPTIMUS can be attributed specifically to being able to encode the entire dialog in latent space.","Dialog response generation The open-domain dialog response generation task is considered: generating responses z given a dialog history c. Following (Gao et al, 2019a), we embed the history and response in a joint latent space as z_{S2S} and z_{ae}, respectively. A fusion regularization is used to match the responses to the context. We consider Dailydialog (Li et al, 2017) used in (Gu et al, 2019), which has 13,118 daily conversations. Each utterance is processed as the response of previous 10 context utterances from both speakers. The baseline methods are described in Appendix. We measure the performance using Bleu (Chen and Cherry, 2014), and compute the precision, recall and Fl in Table 4. OPTIMUS shows higher Bleu scores than all existing baselines."
"Are there any similar approaches to OPTIMUS, but on bigger and more modern architectures (e.g., GPT-J, T5)?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Maximum length T used for the experiment was 10.

According to the context, the sequences were truncated to a maximum length of T=10, and if the sequence length was greater than T, the most recent T actions were considered. This means that for the experiment, the maximum length of the sequences was 10, and any sequences longer than 10 were truncated to 10.

As for the ratio of sequences that were longer than length T, the context does not provide direct information on this. However, based on the fact that the sequences were truncated to T=10, it can be inferred that some sequences were longer than 10, but the exact ratio of such sequences is not specified in the context","This paper does not mention any existing approaches similar to OPTIMUS which use larger models such as GPT-J or T-5. The authors do mention in multiple places that using VAEs (which is what OPTIMUS is) is not very common in the field, and that existing attempts to use VAEs for language modelling typically use smaller models that are not very deep. Both these pieces of information suggest that work using models such as GPT-J or T5 for similar VAE-based approaches does not exist, but it is not possible to say that with certainty from the contents of this paper alone.","While deep generative models (DGMs) such as VAEs are theoretically attractive due to its principle nature, it is now rarely used by practitioners in the modern pre-trained language modeling era where BERT/GPT dominate with strong empirical performance. That’s why this paper makes a timely contribution to making DGMs practical for NLP. We hope that this paper will help renew interest in DGMs for this purpose.Hence, we deliberately keep a simple model, believing that the first pre-trained big VAE model itself and its implications are novel: it helps the community to recognize the importance of DGMs in the pre-training era, and revisit DGMs to make it more practical.Indeed, Optimus is uniquely positioned to learn a smooth latent space to organize sentences, which can enable guided language generation compared with GPT-2, and yield better generalization in low-resource language understanding tasks than BERT. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma and Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) provide a tractable method to train latent-variable generative models. In NLP, latent variables may assume the role of higher-level sentence representations, which govern a lower-level word-by-word generation process, thus facilitating controlled text generation (Bowman et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2017). By representing sentences in a low-dimensional latent space, VAEs allow easy manipulation of sentences using the corresponding compact vector representations, such as feature regularization specified by prior distributions, and guided sentence generation with interpretable vector operators. Despite the attractive theoretical strengths, the current language VAEs are often built with shallow network architectures, such as two-layer LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). This limits the model’s capacity and leads to sub-optimal performance."
How is the Optimus pre-training objectives and its information bottleneck approach any different to those of traditional VAEs (used for image generation)?,"The use of shortcut connections in this paper differs from previous practices and theories in several ways. Unlike MLPs, which add a linear layer connected from the network input to the output, or highway networks with gating functions, our identity shortcuts are parameter-free and always pass information through. Additionally, while highway networks have not demonstrated accuracy gains with extremely increased depth, our formulation learns residual functions and can handle deep networks","The paper explains how information theoretic principles can be used to measure the predictive power of a model and its' compactness (a measure of how complex the learned representations are)and represent it as a tradeoff. They explain how they manage to inject conditioning vectors into GPT without having to pretrain it again specifically for this and also discuss how they combine GPT and BERT. However, the authors do not specifically discuss the differences between their VAE by comparing it with VAEs used for image generation. Presumably, this might be because the authors intended to create a simple VAE model, as a proof of concept that such models can work well for language tasks as well, which is why might not be making extensive customisations to tailor VAEs for language tasks.","From an information theory perspective, information bottleneck (IB) provides a principled approach to find the trade-off between predictive power and complexity (compactness) when summarizing observed data in learned representations. We show that our Optimus pre-training objectives effectively practice the IB principle as follows. Along the way to build the first big VAE language model, there are several technical contributions/implications that are novel: (\textup{\it i}) Latent vector injection: this work demonstrates two schemes to discuss how to effectively inject conditioning vectors into GPT-2 without re-training it.(\textup{\it ii}) The design idea to combine BERT/GPT-2 serves as a practical recipe to inspire people to integrate and reuse existing PLMs for larger and complex models.(\textup{\it iii}) Pre-training on massive datasets itself is an effective approach to reduce KL vanishing, as demonstrated by the state of-the-art performance on four VAE language modeling datasets. (\textup{\it iv}) The proof of VAE objective from the lens of IB, showing that VAE is a principled approach to balance the compactness and usability of learned representations.(\textup{\it v}) Improved performance on several language tasks shows the importance and necessity of pre-training a latent space."
"How are WordPiece Embeddings and Byte Pair Encoding tokenization different, and why do BERT and GPT-2 use them respectively?","The author emphasizes their model as ""zero-shot"" because it does not rely on any external knowledge or pre-training, instead using only a short text description to link entities, achieving state-of-the-art performance levels for large-scale entity linking","BERT and GPT2 are different kinds of models, which is why they might be using different kinds of encoding schemes. BERT is primarily an encoder model, while GPT-like models are generative models that autoregressively predict the next token based on the series of tokens seen so far. This primary difference in class of models might explain why BERT uses WPE while GPT uses BPE tokenization. More details on why these specific tokenization schemes are used for each model can not be found in this paper.","PLMs can generally play two different roles:(\textup{\it i})a generic encoder such as BERT Devlin et al. (2019) to provide contextualized representations for language understanding tasks, and(\textup{\it ii})a powerful decoder such as GPT-2 Radford et al. (2019) to generate text sequences in an auto-regressive manner. In a bid to combine language understanding and generation tasks in one unified framework, several model variants have been proposed, including UniLM Dong et al. (2019), BART Lewis et al. (2019), and T5 Raffel et al. (2019). Although significant performance improvement has been reported on a wide range of NLP tasks, these models lack of explicit modeling of structures in a compact latent space, rendering it difficult to control language generation/representation from an abstract level. Two technical questions remain, when pre-training Optimus from BERT & GPT-2:(\textup{\it i}) How to represent sentences, since the two PLMs employ different tokenization schemes?(\textup{\it ii}) How to adapt a pre-trained GPT-2 to arbitrary conditional input without re-training the model again? Controllable GPT-2 models have been studied in Keskar et al. (2019); Zellers et al. (2019); Peng et al. (2020a, b) when prescribed control codes/tokens are provided, but it is still unknown how to ground GPT-2 to arbitrary conditional inputs. In BERT, WordPiece Embeddings (WPE) is used for tokenization (vocabulary size is 28996 for the cased version). In GPT-2, the modified Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Radford et al. (2019) is used for tokenization (vocabulary size is 50260). A given token is represented as {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Emb}}, by summing the corresponding token, position and segment embeddings 333Optimus does not require segment embeddings, but we remain it due to BERT initialization..For a sentence, we present it in both types of tokenization: the input of encoder is WPE, and the output of decoder is BPE to compute the reconstruction loss. However, the only source of variation in NLMs, GPT2 and GPT3 is modeled in the conditionals at every step: the text generation process only depends on previous word tokens, and there is limited capacity for the generation to be guided by the higher-level structures that are likely presented in natural language, such as tense, topics or sentiment."
"If the same information from the latent vector is being added during decoding, why did the Memory scheme yield higher performance?","By eliminating bounding box proposals and resampling stages, and adding improvements such as using small convolutional filters for object category and offset predictions, separate predictors for different aspect ratios, and applying filters to multiple feature maps for detection at multiple scales","The authors theorize that the memory scheme is better since the latent information is accessible to every layer in the neural network, instead of being available to only two layers (input, output) in the embedding approach.","Similar to BERT, the first token of every sentence is always a special classification token ([CLS]). The last-layer hidden state {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}\in\mathbb{R}^{H} corresponding to this token is used as the sentence-level representation. It further constructs the latent representation \boldsymbol{z}={{\bf W}}_{\text{E}}{\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}, where \boldsymbol{z}\in\mathbb{R}^{P} is a P-dimensional vector and {{\bf W}}_{\text{E}}\in\mathbb{R}^{P\times H} is the weight matrix. To facilitate \boldsymbol{z} in GPT-2 decoding without re-training the weights, we consider two schemes, illustrated in Figure 2:•Memory: \boldsymbol{z} plays the role of an additional memory vector {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Mem}} for GPT2 to attend. Specifically, {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Mem}}={{\bf W}}_{\text{M}}\boldsymbol{z}, where {{\bf W}}_{\text{M}}\in\mathbb{R}^{LH\times P} is the weight matrix. {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Mem}}\in\mathbb{R}^{LH} is separated into L vectors of length H, each of which is attended by GPT-2 in one layer.•Embedding: \boldsymbol{z} is added on the original embedding layer, and directly used in every decoding step. The new embedding representation is {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Emb}}^{\prime}={\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{Emb}}+{{\bf W}}_{\text{D}}\boldsymbol{z}, where {{\bf W}}_{\text{D}}\in\mathbb{R}^{H\times P}.We study their empirical performance in Section B.1 of Appendix, and observe that Memory is significantly more effective than Embedding, and the integration of both schemes yields slightly better results. We hypothesize that the reason why Memory is superior is because it allows the decoder to attend the latent information at every layer ofthe network directly, while the Embedding method only allows the decoder to see the latentinformation at the input and output layer.In our experiments, we use the integration scheme by default.In summary, the encoder parameters \boldsymbol{\phi}=\{\boldsymbol{\phi}_{\text{BERT}},{{\bf W}}_{\text{E}}\}, and decoder parameters \boldsymbol{\theta}=\{\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{GPT-2}},{{\bf W}}_{\text{M}},{{\bf W}}_{\text{D}}\}."
"Why does annealing the value of beta and, as a consequence, decrease the KL regularization during training cause the decoder to make greater use of z?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Using a single word embedding instead of multiple embeddings can capture more expressivity because it allows for a higher degree of flexibility in the textual embedding space","While the authors explained in detail the method in which they cyclically annealed the value of beta while training their VAE and that KL regularization impacts features on the previous layer, this paper does not delve into the reasons why annealing the value of beta causes the decoder to make greater use of z. This is possibly because annealing beta as described in the paper is a widely used practice while training models such as these, which is why the authors may not have chosen to explain this assuming that these are broadly known pieces of information.","To reduce this issue, we follow the intuition that if the encoder is providing useful information from the beginning of decoder training, the decoder is more likely to make use of \boldsymbol{z} Fu et al. (2019); He et al. (2019). Specifically, we use the cyclical schedule to anneal \beta for 10 periods Fu et al. (2019).Within one period, there are three consecutive stages: Training AE (\beta=0) for 0.5 proportion, annealing \beta from 0 to 1 for 0.25 proportion, and fixing \beta=1 for 0.25 proportion. When \beta>0, we use the KL thresholding scheme Li et al. (2019); Kingma et al. (2016), and replace the KL term \mathcal{L}_{R} in (6) with a hinge loss term that maxes each component of the original KL with a constant \lambda:ℒR′=∑imax[λ,KL(qϕ(zi|𝒙)||p(zi))]\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{R}^{\prime}=\sum_{i}\max[\lambda,\mbox{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(z_{i}|\boldsymbol{x})||p(z_{i}))]caligraphic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_max [ italic_λ , KL ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | bold_italic_x ) | | italic_p ( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ) ](9)Here, z_{i} denotes the ith dimension of \boldsymbol{z}. Usingthe thresholding objective causes learning to give up driving down KL for dimensions of \boldsymbol{z} that are already beneath the target compression rate. Due to the regularization term \mathcal{L}_{R}, Optimus can organize sentences in the way specified by the prior distribution. For basic VAEs, a smooth feature space is learned, which is specifically beneficial for better generalization when the number of task-specific labeled data is low.To have a fair comparison, we follow the BERT paper, where the hidden feature of [CLS] is used as thesentence-level representation.

Two schemes are used:(\textup{\it i}) Fine-tuning, where both the pre-trained model and the classifier are updated;(\textup{\it ii}) Feature-based, where pre-trained model weights are frozen to provide embeddings for the classifier update."
Why does higher performance than hierarchical VAE (hVAE) show that it is important to pre-train a latent space? Did hVAE not pre-train a latent space or was the approach different?,"True. The authors argue that LSTM-based approaches have limitations in generating concrete chord structures and capturing realistic patterns of chords, as they are unable to encode original melodic structures and do not explicitly consider capturing chord progressions","This paper does not contain detailed information about VAEs so answering it with information from this paper is not possible. The authors mention that their outperformance of existing VAE methods might be due to the efficacy of their pretraining method which is able to solve the KL vanishing issue sufficiently, but it is unclear if hVAE faced similar problems or not.","The results are shown in Table 1. Various \lambda values are used, we observe a trade-off between language modeling and representation learning, controlled by \lambda. Compared with existing VAE methods, Optimus achieve significantly lower perplexity, and higher MI/AU. This indicates that our pre-training method is an effective approach to reduce KL vanishing issue and training VAEs, especially given the fact that we only fine-tune on these datasets for one epoch. Optimus achieves lower perplexity compared with GPT-2 on three out of four datasets. Intuitively, this is because the model can leverage the prior language knowledge encoded in \boldsymbol{z}. This gap is larger, when the sentences in the dataset exhibit common regularities, such as \mathtt{SNLI}, where the prior plays a more important/effective role in this scenario.Though the form of our model is simple, Optimus shows stronger empirical performance than sophisticated models that are particularly designed for long-text, such as hVAE in Shen et al. (2019). For example, the KL and PPL ofOptimus (15.09 and 22.79) are much better than hVAE (6.8 and 45.8) on Yelp dataset. This verifies the importance of pre-training a latent space.The full experimental results are shown in Table 8, 9, 10 and 11 of Appendix."
"What does ""Active Units"" mean and how is it measured?",To prevent leftward information flow in the decoder and preserve the auto-regressive property,"“Active units” is a measurement metric used by the authors to measure the learning capacity of their model. Additional information on how it is measured is not available in this paper, presumably because it is a widely known unit of measurement in the field.","There are two types of metrics to evaluate language VAEs.(\textup{\it i}) Generation capability: we use perplexity (PPL). Note that NLM and GPT-2 has exactly PPL, while VAEs does not. Following He et al. (2019), we use the importance weighted bound in Burda et al. (2015) to approximate \log p(\boldsymbol{x}), and report PPL.(\textup{\it ii}) Representation learning capability: Active units (AU) of \boldsymbol{z} and its Mutual Information (MI) with \boldsymbol{x}.We report the full results with ELBO, KL and Reconstruction in Appendix, but note that higher ELBO does not necessarily yield better language modeling."
"How do the specific contributions of this work make the construction of deep generative models, like VAEs, for language modeling more practical?",Severe degradation of both classification and dialogue tasks,"The main thesis of this work is around the idea that large VAE models for language tasks can work effectively, and the authors attempt to provide initial evidence for this by implementing a large model which they named OPTIMUS. The first major contribution the authors make is in showing how the KL vanishing issue is addressed in the pretraining phase. Next, the authors explain how conditioning vectors can be injected into GPT without the need for retraining, which brings down the cost and barrier to entry to develop models such as these. Finally, the authors also discuss how to combine multiple pretrained language models (PLMs) such as BERT and GPT, which have very different input formats (i.e. tokenization schemes).","Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) Kingma and Welling (2013); Rezende et al. (2014) provide a tractable method to train latent-variable generative models. In NLP, latent variables may assume the role ofhigher-level sentence representations, which govern a lower-level word-by-word generation process, thus facilitating controlled text generation Bowman et al. (2016); Hu et al. (2017). By representing sentences in a low-dimensional latent space, VAEs allow easy manipulation of sentences using the corresponding compact vector representations, such as feature regularization specified by prior distributions, and guided sentence generation with interpretable vector operators.Despite the attractive theoretical strengths, the current language VAEs are often built with shallow network architectures, such as two-layer LSTMs Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). This limits the model’s capacity and leads to sub-optimal performance. Along the way to build the first big VAE language model, there are several technical contributions/implications that are novel: (\textup{\it i}) Latent vector injection: this work demonstrates two schemes to discuss how to effectively inject conditioning vectors into GPT-2 without re-training it.(\textup{\it ii}) The design idea to combine BERT/GPT-2 serves as a practical recipe to inspire people to integrate and reuse existing PLMs for larger and complex models.(\textup{\it iii}) Pre-training on massive datasets itself is an effective approach to reduce KL vanishing, as demonstrated by the state of-the-art performance on four VAE language modeling datasets. (\textup{\it iv}) The proof of VAE objective from the lens of IB, showing that VAE is a principled approach to balance the compactness and usability of learned representations.(\textup{\it v}) Improved performance on several language tasks shows the importance and necessity of pre-training a latent space. While deep generative models (DGMs) such as VAEs are theoretically attractive due to its principle nature, it is now rarely used by practitioners in the modern pre-trained language modeling era where BERT/GPT dominate with strong empirical performance. That’s why this paper makes a timely contribution to making DGMs practical for NLP. We hope that this paper will help renew interest in DGMs for this purpose.Hence, we deliberately keep a simple model, believing that the first pre-trained big VAE model itself and its implications are novel: it helps the community to recognize the importance of DGMs in the pre-training era, and revisit DGMs to make it more practical.Indeed, Optimus is uniquely positioned to learn a smooth latent space to organize sentences, which can enable guided language generation compared with GPT-2, and yield better generalization in low-resource language understanding tasks than BERT. All these efforts utilize simple LSTM Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) and shallow Transformer Vaswani et al. (2017) architectures, thus with limited capacity. Our paper is the first big VAE model at the same scale of recent PLMs such as BERT and GPT-2. More importantly, we show that pre-training a meaningful latent space on a large text corpus can largely reduce the KL vanishing issue, and lead to new state-of-the-art performance."
How is using a conditional GAN to produce a latent vector from a label different to using the encoder in OPTIMUS with just the label as its input? ,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Because larger models have more capacity to learn from human annotations, resulting in greater improvements in performance through instruction-tuning","The conditional GAN generates a latent vector which is then passed to OPTIMUS' decoder, which produces the output. It is unclear if merely passing a label to OPTIMUS' encoder would be sufficient to generate a useful latent space encoding since the OPTIMUS encoder has not been trained with this objective in mind.","The short \mathtt{Yelp} dataset collected in Shen et al. (2017) is used. It contains 444K training sentences, and we use separated datasets of 10K sentences for validation/testing, respectively. The goal is to generate text reviews given the positive/negative sentiment. We fine-tune Optimus using the VAE objective on the dataset, then freeze backbone weights. A conditional GAN Mirza and Osindero (2014) is trained on the fixed latent space. The generation process is to first produce a latent vector \boldsymbol{z}_{y} based on a given label y using conditional GAN, then generate sentences conditioned on \boldsymbol{z}_{y} using the decoder.The baselines are described in Appendix. G-score computes the geometric mean of Accuracy and Bleu, measuring the comprehensive quality of both content and style.Self-Bleu measures the diversity of the generated sentences. The results are shown in Table 6, Optimus achieves the best performance on all metrics.This verifies the importance of learning a smooth and meaningful latent space.The conditional generated sentences are shown in Appendix."
What metric did the authors use to measure generalizability on low-resource language understanding tasks?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

NO.

According to the context, even when dense/sparse retrievers are pre-trained on the target corpus to enable corpus-awareness, they do not consistently outperform lexical models like BM25","The main performance metric the authors use to measure generalizability on low resource is the GLUE benchmark. More broadly, the authors explain that their model is suitable for low resource settings to begin with since their model can be specialized at low cost (through feature based approaches) and can function with very little labelled data.","We further consider the GLUE benchmark Wang et al. (2019), which consists of nine datasets for general language understanding.Following the finetuning schedule in Devlin et al. (2019), we use learning rate [2,3,4,5]\times 10^{-5} and train the model for 3 epochs. We select the best performance among different runs. We show the results on the validation set in Table 7.With the feature-based scheme, Optimus yields higher performance than BERT, especially on the large datasets such as MNLI, QQP and QNLI. When the full models are fine-tuned, the two methods perform quite similarly. In summary, the scenarios that Optimus fit the low-resource settings are two-fold: (1) The required computing resource is low: the feature-based approach only updates the classifier, whosecomputing requirement is much lower than full-model fine-tuning; (2) The number of required labelled data is low: when labelled data is rare, Optimus adapts better.The results confirm that Optimus can maintain and exploit the structures learned in pre-training, and presents a more general representation that can be adapted to new tasks more easily than BERT – feature-based adaption is much faster and easier to perform than fine-tuning."
"What does ""smooth feature regularization"" mean?",The authors processed the continuous data in the Frey Face dataset using a decoder with Gaussian outputs and a sigmoidal activation function at the decoder output,"The authors do not explicitly define what ""smooth"" means anywhere in the paper, though possible meanings could be interpolated from the author's statements in the papers. The authors mention that the regularization term in Optimus is what helps a basic VAE learn a smooth feature space. They also use t-SNE to visualize learned features, which indicates that ""smooth"" in this context just means cleaner, free-flowing boundaries of the latent space. However, additional information is required to formally define smoothness, which does not seem to be available in the paper.","•AE. Only \mathcal{L}_{E} is considered (\beta=0), while the Gaussian sampling in q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z}|\boldsymbol{x}) remains. In other words, the regularization is removed, and a point-estimate is likely to be learned to represent the text sequence’s latent feature.Note our reconstruction is on sentence-level, while other PLMs Devlin et al. (2019); Yang et al. (2019) employ masked LM loss, performing token-level reconstruction. •VAE. The full VAE objective is considered (\beta>0). It tends to learn a smooth latent space due to \mathcal{L}_{R}. Due to the regularization term \mathcal{L}_{R}, Optimus can organize sentences in the way specified by the prior distribution. For basic VAEs, a smooth feature space is learned, which is specifically beneficial for better generalization when the number of task-specific labeled data is low.To have a fair comparison, we follow the BERT paper, where the hidden feature of [CLS] is used as thesentence-level representation. In this way, the linear classifiers for both models have the same number of trainableparameters. Though the latent vector \boldsymbol{z} is typically used as sentence-level representation in VAE literature, we argue that the KL regularization applied on \boldsymbol{z} has a large impact on the preceding layer feature {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}.Specifically, {\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}} is fed into an linear classifier {{\bf W}}_{\text{C}}\in\mathbb{R}^{K\times H}, where K is the number of classes, with objective -\log(\text{softmax}({\boldsymbol{h}}_{\texttt{[CLS]}}{{\bf W}}_{\text{C}}^{\top})). Two schemes are used:(\textup{\it i}) Fine-tuning, where both the pre-trained model and the classifier are updated;(\textup{\it ii}) Feature-based, where pre-trained model weights are frozen to provide embeddings for the classifier update. We use tSNE Maaten and Hinton (2008) to visualize the learned feature on a 2D map. The validation set of Yelp is used to extract the latent features.Compared with BERT, Optimus learns a smoother space and more structured latent patterns, which explains why Optimus can yield better classification performance and faster adaptation."
"What is ""KL vanishing"" with respect to VAEs?",Nguyen et al. (2016) collected the queries from MSMARCO-Passage dataset to make MSMARCO-TRAIN query set,"The authors do not explicitly explain the KL vanishing problem in detail, but they do cite a recent work, Bowman et al. (2016), that probably contains more detailed information on this problem. Additionally, the authors explain that KL regularization is a problem that specifically happens with Variational Autoencoders only (i.e. regular AEs do not seem to have this problem). When explaining how VAEs can be considered to be equivalent to AEs with KL regularization, we see the main difference between AEs and VAEs is the extra KL term added to VAEs. Putting all this information together, one could conclude that ""KL vanishing"" refers to this KL term in a VAE becoming zero during training. The authors list multiple methods (annealing, specialized decoder architectures, auxiliary loss functions, etc) that people in the field have used to prevent this from happening.","There is an alternative interpretation of the ELBO: the VAE objective can be viewed as a regularized version of the autoencoder (AE) Goodfellow et al. (2016).It is thus natural to extend the negative of \mathcal{L}_{\text{ELBO}} in (3) by introducing a hyper-parameter \beta to control the strength of regularization:\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\displaystyle=\mathcal{L}_{E}+\beta\mathcal{L}_{R},~{}~{}\text{with}(4)\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{E}\displaystyle=-\mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z}|\boldsymbol{x})}\big{[}\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{z})\big{]}(5)\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{R}=KL(qϕ(𝒛|𝒙)||p(𝒛))\displaystyle=\mbox{KL}(q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{z}|\boldsymbol{x})||p(\boldsymbol{z}))= KL ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_z | bold_italic_x ) | | italic_p ( bold_italic_z ) )(6)where \mathcal{L}_{E} is the reconstruction error (or negative log-likelihood (NLL)), and \mathcal{L}_{R} is a KL regularizer.The cost function \mathcal{L}_{\beta} provides a unified perspective for understanding various autoencoder variants and training methods. We consider two types of latent space with the following objectives: We train the model parameters \{\boldsymbol{\phi},\boldsymbol{\theta}\} using two objectives: AE and VAE, discussed in Section 4.1. Pre-training AE using  (5) is straightforward. However, pre-training VAE can be challenging due to the notorious KL vanishing issue Bowman et al. (2016), where(\textup{\it i})an encoder that produces posteriors almost identical to the Gaussian prior for all sentences (rather than a more interesting posterior); and(\textup{\it ii})a decoder that completely ignores \boldsymbol{z} in (2), and a learned model that reduces to a simpler NLM.

"Is ""one-step-ahead conditional"" here mean the same as the modelled probability of calculating the next token?",0.5,"Yes, ""one-step-ahead conditional"", in this context refers to the calculation of probabilities for what the next token might be, given a sequence of past tokens in a sentence","To generate a text sequence of length T, \boldsymbol{x}=[x_{1},\cdots,x_{T}], neural language models (NLM) Mikolov et al.

"Does ""generation"" and ""inference"" here mean the same as ""decoder"" and ""encoder"", respectively?","Feature-based methods in face recognition derive a low-dimensional representation of the face through certain distribution assumptions, such as linear subspace, manifold, and sparse representation. These methods have been dominant in the FR community, but have limitations in addressing uncontrolled facial changes","Yes, in this context, ""generation"" refers to ""decoder"" and ""inference"" refers to encoder.","The generative model (decoder) draws a latent vector \boldsymbol{z} from the continuous latent space with priorp(\boldsymbol{z}), and generates the text sequence \boldsymbol{x} from a conditional distribution p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{z}); p(\boldsymbol{z}) is typically assumed a multivariate Gaussian, and \boldsymbol{\theta} represents the neural network parameters. The following auto-regressive decoding process is usually used:\displaystyle\vspace{-2mm}p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{z})=\prod_{t=1}^{T}p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(x_{t}|x_{<t},\boldsymbol{z}).\vspace{-4mm}(2)Intuitively, VAE provides a “hierachical” generation procedure: \boldsymbol{z}\sim p(\boldsymbol{z}) determines the high-level semantics, followed by (2) to produce the output sentences with low-level syntactic and lexical details. This contrasts with (1) in the explicit dependency on \boldsymbol{z}. Similar to GPT-2, parameters \boldsymbol{\theta} are typically learned by maximizing the marginal log likelihood \log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x})=\log\int p(\boldsymbol{z})p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{z})\mbox{d}\boldsymbol{z}.However, this marginal term is intractable to compute for many decoder choices.

Is the regularization here intended to make sure that the prior distribution is similar to a given distribution like a Gaussian distribution?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Differential interference contrast (DIC) is a microscopy technique that enhances the contrast between the object and its surroundings by manipulating the phase of the light waves","Yes, regularization is used to ensure that the model, Optimus, can organize sentences in a manner similar to some specified prior distribution.

Does this attention mechanism resemble the human attention attitude in the intuition or idea?,"Yes, there is a rule of thumb for the number of frames per second (FPS) in videos, and it can affect the training bias.

According to the context, the videos considered in the paper typically consist of hundreds to thousands of frames, at a frame rate of at least 24 frames per second. However, the paper notes that the number of frames per second can bring some bias in training, and higher frame rates can result in more stable training.

Therefore, there is no strict rule for the number of frames per second, but a higher frame rate (e.g., 30 or 60 FPS) is generally recommended for smoother and more stable training",Yes the attention mechanism resemble to human attention attitude because it can yield more interpretable models which can extract syntactic and semantic structure from sentences.,"As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences."
What are benefits of using learnable parameters for capturing positional information rather than using sines and cosines to capture these positions?,No,The two choices of Positional encoding are learned and fixed. In the experiments the two versions produced nearly identical results. The fixed sinusoidal positional encoding has the advantage that it can handle the sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.,"Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add ""positional encodings"" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d_{\text{model}} as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed (JonasFaceNet2017, ). We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings (JonasFaceNet2017, ) instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training."
Can't we use parallelization with RNN layers approach with any possible way?,"Sure! Yes, the U-Net architecture can be used for self-driving cars to provide a segmentation map for the scene around. Its ability to handle very different biomedical segmentation applications and its efficiency in terms of training time and annotated images make it a promising choice for this task",Because hidden state of each input position depends on previous hidden state therefore RNN can not be parallelized. Whereas Transformer due to attention layers are highly parallel.,"Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h_{t}, as a function of the previous hidden state h_{t-1} and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks (Kuchaiev2017Factorization, ) and conditional computation (shazeer2017outrageously, ), while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains. As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece (wu2016google, ) and byte-pair (sennrich2015neural, ) representations.To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work. For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles. "

why would we need to increase learning rate for the first few training steps while we initially use Adam?,"To achieve interpretability, particularly decomposability of latent representations, allowing for intuitive explanations",In adam optimizer learning rate is linearly increased ay startup for the purpose of warmup during training.,"We used the Adam optimizer (kingma2014adam, ) with \beta_{1}=0.9, \beta_{2}=0.98 and \epsilon=10^{-9}. We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula: This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup\_steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup\_steps=4000."
What are the results and performance with no using of label smoothing ?,Yes,After applying label smoothing regularization perplexity decreases but the accuracy and BLEU score does improve. This means if we do not apply label smoothing accuracy and BLEU score would be decreased.,"During training, we employed label smoothing of value \epsilon_{ls}=0.1 (DBLP:journals/corr/SzegedyVISW15, ). This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score."
"Can we generalize applying transformers to translate from any language to another rather than English, like German-to-Arabic for example?.",Yes,Since the Transformer performed great on   English-to-French and English-to-German translation tasks and can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers therefore it can be hoped that it can be used for any language other than English.,"On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0, outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P_{drop}=0.1, instead of 0.3. For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles. "
Does Conditional Computation have things in common with chain rule between statistical independent variables?,"The statement ""inferior detection accuracy that does not match the network's superior classification accuracy"" can be explained by the fact that the naïve solution of using all convolutional layers to construct the shared, convolutional subnetwork in the object detection architecture does not respect the spatial information and therefore leads to lower detection accuracy compared to the standard Faster R-CNN system that inserts the RoI pooling layer between conv4 and conv5",Yes as the chain rule has a sequence of computations similarly conditional computation method is also sequential.,"Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h_{t}, as a function of the previous hidden state h_{t-1} and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks (Kuchaiev2017Factorization, ) and conditional computation (shazeer2017outrageously, ), while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains."
what is the definition of BLEU?,Yes,"BLEU score is the metric to compute performance of the language translation task.  On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, big transformer model establishes a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. BLUE score also drops with single head or too many heads.","On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4.

The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P_{drop}=0.1, instead of 0.3. In Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads."
Does Conditional Computation mentioned by the authors mean to perform operations depending on the need to perform them?,"Deep learning is used in the process of feature extraction in face recognition systems through the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction, from simple features such as Gabor and SIFT to more complex features that can recognize facial attributes like smile and blue eyes",Paper only mention the advantages of conditional computation that is to improve computational efficiency and model performance.,"Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences.

The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains."
Do conv Nets succeed in sequence modelling in general?,Having RL-based model refinement reduces the effectiveness of coverage penalty and length normalization,Conv Nets can compute the hidden state of the sequence data in parallel for all input and output positions. However conv nets are still more expensive than the recurrent networks.,"A single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O(log_{k}(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions (NalBytenet2017, ), increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network.Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions (xception2016, ), however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O(k\cdot n\cdot d+n\cdot d^{2}). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model. The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU (extendedngpu, ), ByteNet (NalBytenet2017, ) and ConvS2S (JonasFaceNet2017, ), all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions (hochreiter2001gradient, ). In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2."
How could reducing the number of operations into constant result in decreasing resolution ?,"Patchwise training refers to training a deep learning model on a subset of the input data, specifically on individual patches or regions of the image, rather than the entire image",The resolution  is decreased due to averaging in the attention position with Multi-Head Attention.,"Instead of performing a single attention function with d_{\text{model}}-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d_{k}, d_{k} and d_{v} dimensions, respectively.On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d_{v}-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2. The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU (extendedngpu, ), ByteNet (NalBytenet2017, ) and ConvS2S (JonasFaceNet2017, ), all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions.

"Is it crucial to use 6 layers in the encoder? if it is free to change, Does increasing those layers need more data to avoid overfitting or just would take longer time to converge?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the given context:

The author concludes that the non-local means filter is the best filter for denoising images because it preserved all the edges and reduced the noise better than the other filters, as shown in Fig. 3.

Other filters that can be used for the same task include the bilateral filter and the gaussian filter, but the non-local means filter outperformed them in this specific application",For translation tasks the result shows that 6 layers are the optimal number of layers.,"The encoder is composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection (he2016deep, ) around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization layernorm2016 . That is, the output of each sub-layer is \mathrm{LayerNorm}(x+\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)), where \mathrm{Sublayer}(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d_{\text{model}}=512. The decoder is also composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i."
Why -while having data of next positions in training dataset- is it important to modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to ensure that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than ?,"The authors judged the generated instructions as ""meaningful"" based on expert annotation, where an expert annotator labeled each instance as correct or not in terms of the instruction, input, and output",Self attention layer in transformer is modified in decoder stack to attend only the past predictions to preserve the auto-regressive property in the language models.,"The decoder is also composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i. The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:•In ""encoder-decoder attention"" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as (wu2016google, ; bahdanau2014neural, ; JonasFaceNet2017, ).•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -\infty) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2."
What is Attention Function?How is it calculated?,"Yes, LSTIM can synthesize unseen compositions.

Examples of unseen compositions synthesized by LSTIM include:

* Novel scenes with unconventional perspectives or lighting, such as a cityscape at night with glowing neon lights and a futuristic skyline.
* Images that combine elements from different domains, such as a beach scene with a hot air balloon flying overhead.
* Scenes with fantastical or surreal elements, such as a forest filled with giant mushrooms and glowing fungi.

These examples demonstrate the ability of LSTIM to generate novel and unseen compositions, beyond the capabilities of traditional image generation methods",Attention function relates different positions of the sequence to get the overall representation of the sequence. It can be computer by additive attention method or the dot-product method. Attention have been successfully applied in various NLP tasks such as reading comprehensions and summarizations.,"An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention (bahdanau2014neural, ), and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations (cheng2016long, ; decomposableAttnModel, ; paulus2017deep, ; lin2017structured, )."
"What are similarities and differences between Key, Value, and Query?",Time taken to retrieve results,"Key, Value and Query are all vectors, All are used to compute attention.

What is the Difference Between Additive and Multiplicative Attention?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Applying convolutions across patches of the video instead of whole frames helps extract motion information that would otherwise be lost across max-pooling layers",Dot product attention is calculated using optimized matrix multiplication  operations whereas Additive attention is computed by compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. Multiplicative Attention is much faster and more space-efficient than the additive attention.,"The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention (bahdanau2014neural, ), and dot-product (multiplicative) attention.

While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. While for small values of d_{k} the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d_{k} (DBLP:journals/corr/BritzGLL17, ). We suspect that for large values of d_{k}, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 111To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q\cdot k=\sum_{i=1}^{d_{k}}q_{i}k_{i}, has mean 0 and variance d_{k}.. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}."
Shouldn't the inputs in the decoder updated while training after initially setting them to -inf ?,weighted average probability,"Transformer decoder generates an output sequence (y_{1},...,y_{m}) of symbols one element at a time by using the encoder information.

Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x_{1},...,x_{n}) to a sequence of continuous representations \mathbf{z}=(z_{1},...,z_{n}). Given \mathbf{z}, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y_{1},...,y_{m}) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive (graves2013generating, ), consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next."
How should positional information be interpreted or captured with sines and cosines?,"The attention-based models use location-based, dot-based, general-based, and concat-based alignment functions",Positional encoding can be generated using sinusoidal function whose wavelengths form a geometric progression which can encode relative positions. Advantage of the sinusoidal positional encoding is that it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.,"where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2\pi to 10000\cdot 2\pi. We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PE_{pos+k} can be represented as a linear function of PE_{pos}. We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings (JonasFaceNet2017, ) instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training."
Do we care in general for resolution while modelling language?,"Local attention is a method of applying attention to a specific portion of the input sequence, using a sliding window or other technique to define the region of interest",As the transformers are used for language modeling there is a resolution problem due to averaging in attention weights. This problem is reduced by using the multiheaded attention.,"The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions.

What are the two factors the Mobilenet hyperparameters will affect?,3072,MobileNet architecture introduces two hyper-parameters;  width multiplier and resolution multiplier.,"This paper describes an efficient network architecture and a set of two hyper-parameters in order to build very small, low latency models that can be easily matched to the design requirements for mobile and embedded vision applications. Section 2 reviews prior work in building small models. Section 3 describes the MobileNet architecture and two hyper-parameters width multiplier and resolution multiplier to define smaller and more efficient MobileNets. Section 4 describes experiments on ImageNet as well a variety of different applications and use cases. Section 5 closes with a summary and conclusion. Although the base MobileNet architecture is already small and low latency, many times a specific use case or application may require the model to be smaller and faster. In order to construct these smaller and less computationally expensive models we introduce a very simple parameter \alpha called width multiplier. The role of the width multiplier \alpha is to thin a network uniformly at each layer. For a given layer and width multiplier \alpha, the number of input channels M becomes \alpha M and the number of output channels N becomes \alpha N. In this section we first investigate the effects of depthwise convolutions as well as the choice of shrinking by reducing the width of the network rather than the number of layers. We then show the trade offs of reducing the network based on the two hyper-parameters: width multiplier and resolution multiplier and compare results to a number of popular models. We then investigate MobileNets applied to a number of different applications. In this section we first describe the core layers that MobileNet is built on which are depthwise separable filters. We then describe the MobileNet network structure and conclude with descriptions of the two model shrinking hyper-parameters width multiplier and resolution multiplier."
What are the fields that needs to be carried out in a timely fashion and on a computationally limited platform?,"Yes, doing batch calls will use cached values","For robotics, self-driving cars and AR, the recognition task needs to be carried timely and with less computational cost.","Convolutional neural networks have become ubiquitous in computer vision ever since AlexNet [19] popularized deep convolutional neural networks by winning the ImageNet Challenge: ILSVRC 2012 [24]. The general trend has been to make deeper and more complicated networks in order to achieve higher accuracy [27, 31, 29, 8]. However, these advances to improve accuracy are not necessarily making networks more efficient with respect to size and speed. In many real world applications such as robotics, self-driving car and augmented reality, the recognition tasks need to be carried out in a timely fashion on a computationally limited platform."
What are MobileNets are primarily built on and what is it main goal?,"The focal loss can be extended to the multi-class problem by using a softmax function to convert the predicted probabilities to class probabilities, and then applying the focal loss formula to each class separately","MobileNets are built primarily on depthwise separable convolutions, a specialized method which reduces the computational cost. The main goal for MobileNets to design an efficient architecture is to reduce latency while maintaining state of the art accuracy.","This paper describes an efficient network architecture and a set of two hyper-parameters in order to build very small, low latency models that can be easily matched to the design requirements for mobile and embedded vision applications. Section 2 reviews prior work in building small models. Section 3 describes the MobileNet architecture and two hyper-parameters width multiplier and resolution multiplier to define smaller and more efficient MobileNets. Section 4 describes experiments on ImageNet as well a variety of different applications and use cases. Section 5 closes with a summary and conclusion. There has been rising interest in building small and efficient neural networks in the recent literature, e.g. [16, 34, 12, 36, 22]. Many different approaches can be generally categorized into either compressing pretrained networks or training small networks directly. This paper proposes a class of network architectures that allows a model developer to specifically choose a small network that matches the resource restrictions (latency, size) for their application. MobileNets primarily focus on optimizing for latency but also yield small networks. Many papers on small networks focus only on size but do not consider speed. MobileNets are built primarily from depthwise separable convolutions initially introduced in [26] and subsequently used in Inception models [13] to reduce the computation in the first few layers. Flattened networks [16] build a network out of fully factorized convolutions and showed the potential of extremely factorized networks. Independent of this current paper, Factorized Networks[34] introduces a similar factorized convolution as well as the use of topological connections. Subsequently, the Xception network [3] demonstrated how to scale up depthwise separable filters to out perform Inception V3 networks. Another small network is Squeezenet [12] which uses a bottleneck approach to design a very small network. Other reduced computation networks include structured transform networks [28] and deep fried convnets [37]."
What is distillation and why it is used?,"The vastness of the evaluated videos could be quantitatively measured using metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD), Inception Score (IS), Frechet Inception Distance (FID), CLIPSIM, and human evaluation metrics such as video quality and text-video faithfulness",Distillation is a knowledge transfer technique for deep networks which is used for compute efficient model design.,"Another use-case for MobileNet is compressing large systems with unknown or esoteric training procedures. In a face attribute classification task, we demonstrate a synergistic relationship between MobileNet and distillation [9], a knowledge transfer technique for deep networks. We seek to reduce a large face attribute classifier with 75 million parameters and 1600 million Mult-Adds. The classifier is trained on a multi-attribute dataset similar to YFCC100M [32]. We distill a face attribute classifier using the MobileNet architecture. Distillation [9] works by training the classifier to emulate the outputs of a larger model222The emulation quality is measured by averaging the per-attribute cross-entropy over all attributes. instead of the ground-truth labels, hence enabling training from large (and potentially infinite) unlabeled datasets. Marrying the scalability of distillation training and the parsimonious parameterization of MobileNet, the end system not only requires no regularization (e.g. weight-decay and early-stopping), but also demonstrates enhanced performances. It is evident from Tab. 12 that the MobileNet-based classifier is resilient to aggressive model shrinking: it achieves a similar mean average precision across attributes (mean AP) as the in-house while consuming only 1\% the Multi-Adds."
What is a depthwise separable convolution means?,"Dynamic routing and utilization of all layers.

Despite the deepest highway network having the same/worse performance as the plain network in the left graph of Figure 1, the benefits of using highway networks with deeper layers lie in their ability to dynamically route and utilize all layers, as observed in the mean transform gate activity and single example transform gate outputs in Figure 2. This allows the network to learn a more efficient use of its layers for each input, leading to better generalization and performance on unseen data",Depthwise separable convolution is made up of two layers: depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions where depthwise convolutions apply a single filter per each input channel and a Pointwise convolution creates a linear combination of the output of the depthwise layer.,"The standard convolution operation has the effect of filtering features based on theconvolutional kernels and combining features in order to produce a new representation.The filtering and combination steps can be split into two steps via the use offactorized convolutions called depthwise separable convolutions for substantial reduction in computational cost. Depthwise separable convolution are made up of two layers: depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions.We use depthwise convolutions to apply a single filter per each input channel (input depth). Pointwise convolution, asimple 1\times 1 convolution, is then used to create a linear combination of the output of the depthwise layer. MobileNets use bothbatchnorm and ReLU nonlinearities for both layers. Depthwise convolution is extremely efficient relative to standard convolution. However it only filters input channels, it does not combine them to create new features. So an additional layer that computes a linear combination of the output of depthwise convolution via 1\times 1 convolution is needed in order to generate these new features. The combination of depthwise convolution and 1\times 1 (pointwise) convolution is called depthwise separable convolution which was originally introduced in [26]. The MobileNet model is based on depthwise separable convolutions which is a form of factorized convolutions which factorize a standard convolution into a depthwise convolution and a 1\times 1 convolution called a pointwise convolution. For MobileNets the depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel. The pointwise convolution then applies a 1\times 1 convolution to combine the outputs the depthwise convolution. A standard convolution both filters and combines inputs into a new set of outputs in one step. The depthwise separable convolution splits this into two layers, a separate layer for filtering and a separate layer for combining. This factorization has the effect of drastically reducing computation and model size. Figure 2 shows how a standard convolution 2(a) is factorized into a depthwise convolution 2(b) and a 1\times 1 pointwise convolution 2(c)."
Describe how mobile net use depthwise separable convolution to reduce computation and the model size,"No.

The authors' approach relies on the summaries being abstractive and not simply copying sentences from the documents. If the summaries were created by extracting sentences, the resulting questions would be too easy and not provide enough challenge for the reading comprehension models being trained",MobileNets use depthwise convolution with one filter per input channel. The pointwise convolution then combines the depthwise convolution outputs with a 1\times 1 convolution. This factorization greatly reduces computation and model size.,"The MobileNet model is based on depthwise separable convolutions which is a form of factorized convolutions which factorize a standard convolution into a depthwise convolution and a 1\times 1 convolution called a pointwise convolution.

The model was specifically designed and trained for prostate segmentation on the MRI data provided in the challenge","Standard convolutions have the computational cost of: D_{K}\cdot D_{K}\cdot M\cdot N\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F} where the computational cost depends multiplicatively on the number of input channels M, the number of output channels N the kernel size D_{k}\times D_{k} and the feature map size D_{F}\times D_{F}.","D_{K}\cdot D_{K}\cdot M\cdot N\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F}(2)where the computational cost depends multiplicatively on the number of input channels M, the number of output channels N the kernel size D_{k}\times D_{k} and the feature map size D_{F}\times D_{F}. MobileNet models address each of these terms and their interactions. First it uses depthwise separable convolutions to break the interaction between the number of output channels and the size of the kernel."
What are the layers of depthwise separable convolution and discuss the function of each of them.,M = D,Depthwise separable convolutions have two layers—depthwise and pointwise. Depthwise convolutions apply one filter per input channel (input depth). The depthwise layer output is linearly combined using pointwise convolution which is a 1\times 1 convolution.,"Depthwise separable convolution are made up of two layers: depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions.We use depthwise convolutions to apply a single filter per each input channel (input depth). Pointwise convolution, asimple 1\times 1 convolution, is then used to create a linear combination of the output of the depthwise layer. MobileNets use bothbatchnorm and ReLU nonlinearities for both layers. The MobileNet model is based on depthwise separable convolutions which is a form of factorized convolutions which factorize a standard convolution into a depthwise convolution and a 1\times 1 convolution called a pointwise convolution. For MobileNets the depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel. The pointwise convolution then applies a 1\times 1 convolution to combine the outputs the depthwise convolution. A standard convolution both filters and combines inputs into a new set of outputs in one step. The depthwise separable convolution splits this into two layers, a separate layer for filtering and a separate layer for combining. This factorization has the effect of drastically reducing computation and model size. Figure 2 shows how a standard convolution 2(a) is factorized into a depthwise convolution 2(b) and a 1\times 1 pointwise convolution 2(c)."
What types of non-linearities is used for both layers of the depthwise separable convolution?,"MRR@10 and Recall@50/200/1000 capture different aspects of end-to-end retrieval performance, with MRR@10 focusing on precision at the top 10 retrieval positions, while Recall@50/200/1000 emphasizes the overall recall of relevant documents in the top N retrieval positions (where N = 50, 200, or 1000)",MobileNet layers use batchnorm and ReLU nonlinearities.,"Depthwise separable convolution are made up of two layers: depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions.We use depthwise convolutions to apply a single filter per each input channel (input depth). Pointwise convolution, asimple 1\times 1 convolution, is then used to create a linear combination of the output of the depthwise layer. MobileNets use bothbatchnorm and ReLU nonlinearities for both layers. The MobileNet structure is built on depthwise separable convolutions as mentioned in the previous section except for the first layer which is a full convolution. By defining the network in such simple terms we are able to easily explore network topologies to find a good network. The MobileNet architecture is defined in Table 1. All layers are followed by a batchnorm [13] and ReLU nonlinearity with the exception of the final fully connected layer which has no nonlinearity and feeds into a softmax layer for classification. Figure 3 contrasts a layer with regular convolutions, batchnorm and ReLU nonlinearity to the factorized layer with depthwise convolution, 1\times 1 pointwise convolution as well as batchnorm and ReLU after each convolutional layer. Down sampling is handled with strided convolution in the depthwise convolutions as well as in the first layer. A final average pooling reduces the spatial resolution to 1 before the fully connected layer. Counting depthwise and pointwise convolutions as separate layers, MobileNet has 28 layers."
What is the cost function of the depthwise convolution?,"The authors restricted batch size to 1 during training to prevent overfitting due to the small size of the TIMIT dataset. With higher batch sizes, the model might have memorized the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns","D_{K}\cdot D_{K}\cdot M\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F}+M\cdot N\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F} is the cost function for depthwise separable convolution. With two hyperparameter settings, the function looks like this - D_{K}\cdot D_{K}\cdot\alpha M\cdot\rho D_{F}\cdot\rho D_{F}+\alpha M\cdot\alpha N\cdot\rho D_{F}\cdot\rho D_{F}","D_{K}\cdot D_{K}\cdot M\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F}+M\cdot N\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F}(5)which is the sum of the depthwise and 1\times 1 pointwise convolutions. The computational cost of a depthwise separable convolution with width multiplier \alpha is:D_{K}\cdot D_{K}\cdot\alpha M\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F}+\alpha M\cdot\alpha N\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F}(6)where \alpha\in(0,1] with typical settings of 1, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.25. \alpha=1 is the baseline MobileNet and \alpha<1are reduced MobileNets. Width multiplier has the effect of reducing computational cost and the number of parameters quadratically by roughly \alpha^{2}. Width multiplier can be applied to any model structure to define a new smaller model with a reasonable accuracy, latency and size trade off. It is used to define a new reduced structure that needs to be trained from scratch. We can now express the computational cost for the core layers of our network as depthwise separable convolutions with width multiplier \alpha and resolution multiplier \rho:D_{K}\cdot D_{K}\cdot\alpha M\cdot\rho D_{F}\cdot\rho D_{F}+\alpha M\cdot\alpha N\cdot\rho D_{F}\cdot\rho D_{F}(7)where \rho\in(0,1] which is typically set implicitly so that the input resolution of the network is 224, 192, 160 or 128. \rho=1 is the baseline MobileNet and \rho<1are reduced computation MobileNets. Resolution multiplier has the effect of reducing computational cost by \rho^{2}."
Why an output layer of 1*1 convolution was added at the end of the architecture?,"Yes. According to the results in Table 3 and the human evaluation in Figure 3, the proposed GPT-Critic algorithm does maintain the ability of GPT-2 to generate human-like responses while improving the task performance",1\times 1 convolution is used to compute linear combination of depthwise convolutions.,"Depthwise separable convolution are made up of two layers: depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions.We use depthwise convolutions to apply a single filter per each input channel (input depth). Pointwise convolution, asimple 1\times 1 convolution, is then used to create a linear combination of the output of the depthwise layer. MobileNets use bothbatchnorm and ReLU nonlinearities for both layers. Depthwise convolution is extremely efficient relative to standard convolution. However it only filters input channels, it does not combine them to create new features. So an additional layer that computes a linear combination of the output of depthwise convolution via 1\times 1 convolution is needed in order to generate these new features."
How much the computational complexity was reduced when using depthwise separable convolution?,Indoor and outdoor scenes from the Cityscapes dataset,3\times 3 depthwise separable convolutions use 8–9 times less computation than standard convolutions.,MobileNet uses 3\times 3 depthwise separable convolutions which uses between 8 to 9 times less computation than standard convolutions at only a small reduction in accuracy as seen in Section 4.
Does all the layers of the MobileNet use depthwise separable convolution?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The real-world dataset used in the experiment is very sparse","The first layer of MobileNet is a full convolution, and the rest are depthwise separable convolutions.","The MobileNet structure is built on depthwise separable convolutions as mentioned in the previous section except for the first layer which is a full convolution. By defining the network in such simple terms we are able to easily explore network topologies to find a good network. The MobileNet architecture is defined in Table 1.

A final average pooling reduces the spatial resolution to 1 before the fully connected layer. Counting depthwise and pointwise convolutions as separate layers, MobileNet has 28 layers. As an example we can look at a typical layer in MobileNet and see how depthwise separable convolutions, width multiplier and resolution multiplier reduce the cost and parameters. Table 3 shows the computation and number of parameters for a layer as architecture shrinking methods are sequentially applied to the layer. The first row shows the Mult-Adds and parameters for a full convolutional layer with an input feature map of size 14\times 14\times 512 with a kernel K of size 3\times 3\times 512\times 512. We will look in detail in the next section at the trade offs between resources and accuracy."
How many layers does the MobileNet has?,"The results of the input-first and output-first approaches are different in terms of the bias towards one label in the generated inputs. The input-first approach can generate inputs biased towards one label, especially for classification tasks, while the output-first approach generates possible class labels and conditions the input generation on each class label, reducing this bias",MobileNet has 28 layers.,"The MobileNet structure is built on depthwise separable convolutions as mentioned in the previous section except for the first layer which is a full convolution.

How the MobileNet model was trained and why it was different than training the large networks?,The author uses off-the-shelf 300-dimensional GloVe CommonCrawl word vectors to create embeddings for each post in the Reddit data,"Authors use less regularization and data augmentation for MobileNets because of less overfitting. Authors avoid side heads and label smoothing when training and limit the size of small crops to reduce image distortions Also, depthwise filters needed little or no weight decay. While all these things are common practices for large datasets, this is redundant for MobileNets.","MobileNet models were trained in TensorFlow [1] using RMSprop [33] with asynchronous gradient descent similar to Inception V3 [31]. However, contrary to training large models we use less regularization and data augmentation techniques because small models have less trouble with overfitting. When training MobileNets we do not use side heads or label smoothing and additionally reduce the amount image of distortions by limiting the size of small crops that are used in large Inception training [31]. Additionally, we found that it was important to put very little or no weight decay (l2 regularization) on the depthwise filters since their are so few parameters in them. For the ImageNet benchmarks in the next section all models were trained with same training parameters regardless of the size of the model."
What is the goal of using width multiplier and how it is used ?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

3 scales (2^k/4, for k≤3) and 3 aspect ratios (0.5, 1, 2) per location","Width multiplier reduces computational cost and parameters by defining a new,untrained & reduced structure.","Although the base MobileNet architecture is already small and low latency, many times a specific use case or application may require the model to be smaller and faster. In order to construct these smaller and less computationally expensive models we introduce a very simple parameter \alpha called width multiplier. The role of the width multiplier \alpha is to thin a network uniformly at each layer. For a given layer and width multiplier \alpha, the number of input channels M becomes \alpha M and the number of output channels N becomes \alpha N. The computational cost of a depthwise separable convolution with width multiplier \alpha is:D_{K}\cdot D_{K}\cdot\alpha M\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F}+\alpha M\cdot\alpha N\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F}(6)where \alpha\in(0,1] with typical settings of 1, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.25. \alpha=1 is the baseline MobileNet and \alpha<1are reduced MobileNets.

Compare between the results of mobile net and full convolutions on the ImageNet dataset,Pubmed,Depthwise separable convolutions reduced ImageNet accuracy by 1±% while saving considerable multiplication addition and model parameters.,First we show results for MobileNet with depthwise separable convolutions compared to a model built with full convolutions. In Table 4 we see that using depthwise separable convolutions compared to full convolutions only reduces accuracy by 1\% on ImageNet was saving tremendously on mult-adds and parameters.
What characteristics did MobileNet showed better performance when compared to other models.,"The method is unable to achieve compelling results with any of the baselines in Figure 5 and 6 because it is not well-suited for tasks that require geometric changes, and the distribution characteristics of the training datasets can cause confusion","MobileNets showed better performance at reducing model size, computational complexity and latency while maintaining comparable accuracy when compared with the other models.","We re-train PlaNet using the MobileNet architecture on the same data. While the full PlaNet model based on the Inception V3 architecture [31] has 52 million parameters and 5.74 billion mult-adds. The MobileNet model has only 13 million parameters with the usual 3 million for the body and 10 million for the final layer and 0.58 Million mult-adds. As shown in Tab. 11, the MobileNet version delivers only slightly decreased performance compared to PlaNet despite being much more compact. Moreover, it still outperforms Im2GPS by a large margin. MobileNet can also be deployed as an effective base network in modern object detection systems.We report results for MobileNet trained for object detection on COCO data based on the recent work that won the 2016 COCO challenge [10].In table 13, MobileNet is compared to VGG and Inception V2 [13] under both Faster-RCNN [23] and SSD [21] framework.In our experiments, SSD is evaluated with 300 input resolution (SSD 300) and Faster-RCNN is compared with both 300 and 600 input resolution (Faster-RCNN 300, Faster-RCNN 600).The Faster-RCNN model evaluates 300 RPN proposal boxes per image. The models are trained on COCO train+val excluding 8k minival images and evaluated on minival.For both frameworks, MobileNet achieves comparable results to other networks with only a fraction of computational complexity and model size. We proposed a new model architecture called MobileNets based on depthwise separable convolutions. We investigated some of the important design decisions leading to an efficient model. We then demonstrated how to build smaller and faster MobileNets using width multiplier and resolution multiplier by trading off a reasonable amount of accuracy to reduce size and latency. We then compared different MobileNets to popular models demonstrating superior size, speed and accuracy characteristics. We concluded by demonstrating MobileNet’s effectiveness when applied to a wide variety of tasks. As a next step to help adoption and exploration of MobileNets, we plan on releasing models in Tensor Flow."
What are the reasons for the remarkable progress in the image recognition task? ,Faster-RCNN framework,"The authors cite the increases in the number of well-constructed large-scale datasets and the usage of CNNs as the main reasons for the progress in the field of image recognition. Well-constructed large-scale datasets facilitate better learning, and the CNN architecture is appropriate for learning informative features from images.","Tremendous progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets (i.e. ImageNet [1, 2]) and the recent revival of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) [3, 4].For data-driven learning, large-scale well-annotated datasets with representative data distribution characteristics are crucial to learning more accurate or generalizable models [5, 4].Unlike previous image datasets used in computer vision, ImageNet [1] offers a very comprehensive database of more than 1.2 million categorized natural images of 1000+ classes.The CNN models trained upon this database serve as the backbone for significantly improving many object detection and image segmentation problems using other datasets [6, 7], e.g., PASCAL [8] and medical image categorization [9, 10, 11, 12].However, there exists no large-scale annotated medical image dataset comparable to ImageNet, as data acquisition is difficult, and quality annotation is costly."
Give examples of two techniques of employing CNNs to medical image,g2o,"There are three main techniques that are used to apply CNNs to tasks involving medical images: 1) training from scratch, 2) using pre-trained CNNs as feature extractors, then using those features with hand-crafted features, and 3) performing unsupervised pre-training then using CNN for fine-tuning. An example of the ""training from scratch"" technique for employing CNNs to medical images is a CNN that was trained from scratch for LN detection. An example of the ""CNN fine-tuning"" technique is a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet that was used for X-ray and CT images for chest pathology identification and detection.","There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: 1) training the “CNN from scratch” [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]; 2) using “off-the-shelf CNN” features (without retraining the CNN) as complementary information channels to existing hand-crafted image features, for Chest X-rays [10] and CT lung nodule identification [9, 12]; and 3) performing unsupervised pre-training on natural or medical images and fine-tuning on medical target images using CNN or other types of deep learning models [18, 19, 20, 21].A decompositional 2.5D view resampling and an aggregation of random view classification scores are used to eliminate the “curse-of-dimensionality” issue in [22], in order to acquire a sufficient number of training image samples. Although natural images and medical images differ significantly, conventional image descriptors developed for object recognition in natural images, such as the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) [30] and the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) [31], have been widely used for object detection and segmentation in medical image analysis. Recently, ImageNet pre-trained CNNs have been used for chest pathology identification and detection in X-ray and CT modalities [10, 9, 12].They have yielded the best performance results by integrating low-level image features (e.g., GIST [32], bag of visual words (BoVW) and bag-of-frequency [12]). However, the fine-tuning of an ImageNet pre-trained CNN model on medical image datasets has not yet been exploited. Until the detection aggregation approach [22], [41], thoracoabdominal lymph node (LN) detection via CADe mechanisms has yielded poor performance results. In [22], each 3D LN candidate produces up to 100 random 2.5D orthogonally sampled images or views which are then used to train an effective CNN model. The best performance on abdominal LN detection is achieved at 83% recall on 3FP per patient [22], using a “Cifar-10” CNN. Using the thoracoabdominal LN detection datasets [22], we aim to surpass this CADe performance level, by testing different CNN architectures, exploring various dataset re-sampling protocols, and applying transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained CNN models."
What are the range of the number of parameters that for the models used in the study?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

HR@k and NDCG@k",The number of parameters range from 5 thousand to 160 million for the models in this study.,"In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously under-studied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems.Particularly, we explore and evaluate different CNN architectures varying in width (ranging from 5 thousand to 160 million parameters) and depth (various numbers of layers), describe the effects of varying dataset scale and spatial image context on performance, and discuss when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet CNN models can be valuable. We further verify our hypothesis by inheriting and adapting rich hierarchical image features [5, 33] from the large-scale ImageNet dataset for computer aided diagnosis (CAD). We also explore CNN architectures of the most studied seven-layered “AlexNet-CNN” [4], a shallower “Cifar-CNN” [22], and a much deeper version of “GoogLeNet-CNN” [33] (with our modifications on CNN structures). This study is partially motivated by recent studies [34, 35] in computer vision. The thorough quantitative analysis and evaluation on deep CNN [34] or sparsity image coding methods [35] elucidate the emerging techniques of the time and provide useful suggestions for their future stages of development, respectively."
What is the number of images and classes does the ImageNet dataset have?,MTL stands for Multi-Task Learning,ImageNet has more than 1.2 million images and about 1000 classes.,"Tremendous progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets (i.e. ImageNet [1, 2]) and the recent revival of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) [3, 4].For data-driven learning, large-scale well-annotated datasets with representative data distribution characteristics are crucial to learning more accurate or generalizable models [5, 4].Unlike previous image datasets used in computer vision, ImageNet [1] offers a very comprehensive database of more than 1.2 million categorized natural images of 1000+ classes.The CNN models trained upon this database serve as the backbone for significantly improving many object detection and image segmentation problems using other datasets [6, 7], e.g., PASCAL [8] and medical image categorization [9, 10, 11, 12].However, there exists no large-scale annotated medical image dataset comparable to ImageNet, as data acquisition is difficult, and quality annotation is costly. The AlexNet architecture was published in [4], achieved significantly improved performance over the other non-deep learning methods for ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012.This success has revived the interest in CNNs [3] in computer vision.ImageNet consists of 1.2 million 256\times 256 images belonging to 1000 categories.At times, the objects in the image are small and obscure, and thus pose more challenges for learning a successful classification model.More details about the ImageNet dataset will be discussed in Sec. III-B.AlexNet has five convolution layers, three pooling layers, and two fully-connected layers with approximately 60 million free parameters.AlexNet is our default CNN architecture for evaluation and analysis in the remainder of the paper. ImageNet [1] has more than 1.2 million 256\times 256 images categorized under 1000 object class categories.There are more than 1000 training images per class.The database is organized according to the WordNet [55] hierarchy, which currently contains only nouns in 1000 object categories.The image-object labels are obtained largely through crowd-sourcing, e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk, and human inspection.Some examples of object categories in ImageNet are “sea snake”, “sandwich”, “vase”, “leopard”, etc.ImageNet is currently the largest image dataset among other standard datasets for visual recognition.Indeed, the Caltech101, Caltech256 and Cifar10 dataset merely contain 60000 32\times 32 images and 10 object classes.Furthermore, due to the large number (1000+) of object classes, the objects belonging to each ImageNet class category can be occluded, partial and small, relative to those in the previous public image datasets.This significant intra-class variation poses greater challenges to any data-driven learning system that builds a classifier to fit given data and generalize to unseen data.For comparison, some example images of Cifar10 dataset and ImageNet images in the “tennis ball” class category are shown in Figure 7.The ImageNet dataset is publicly available, and the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) has become the standard benchmark for large-scale object recognition."
What are the reasons that there is no large-scale annotated medical image dataset such as the ImageNet?,"BLINK achieved zero-shot linking by using a two-stage approach with fine-tuned BERT architectures, which first retrieves candidates in a dense space and then examines them more carefully with a cross-encoder. This approach allows BLINK to outperform IR methods for entity retrieval and achieve new state-of-the-art results on large-scale benchmarks without any task-specific heuristics or external entity knowledge",The authors say that no such dataset exists because data acquisition and annotation in the medical image field is hard and costly.,"Tremendous progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets (i.e. ImageNet [1, 2]) and the recent revival of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) [3, 4].For data-driven learning, large-scale well-annotated datasets with representative data distribution characteristics are crucial to learning more accurate or generalizable models [5, 4].Unlike previous image datasets used in computer vision, ImageNet [1] offers a very comprehensive database of more than 1.2 million categorized natural images of 1000+ classes.The CNN models trained upon this database serve as the backbone for significantly improving many object detection and image segmentation problems using other datasets [6, 7], e.g., PASCAL [8] and medical image categorization [9, 10, 11, 12].However, there exists no large-scale annotated medical image dataset comparable to ImageNet, as data acquisition is difficult, and quality annotation is costly."

What are the CNN architectures that were explored in this paper?,Yes,"The paper uses AlexNet, CifarNet, and GoogLeNet with various numbers of parameters.","We mainly explore three convolutional neural network architectures (CifarNet [5, 22], AlexNet [4] and GoogLeNet [33]) with different model training parameter values.The current deep learning models [22, 52, 53] in medical image tasks are at least 2\sim 5 orders of magnitude smaller than even AlexNet [4].More complex CNN models [22, 52] have only about 150K or 15K parameters.Roth et al. [22] adopt the CNN architecture tailored to the Cifar-10 dataset [5] and operate on image windows of 32\times 32\times 3 pixels for lymph node detection, while the simplest CNN in [54] has only one convolutional, pooling, and FC layer, respectively. We use CifarNet [5] as used in [22] as a baseline for the LN detection.AlexNet [4] and GoogLeNet [33] are also modified to evaluate these state-of-the-art CNN architecture from ImageNet classification task [2] to our CADe problems and datasets.A simplified illustration of three CNN architectures exploited is shown in Figure 5.CifarNet always takes 32\times 32\times 3 image patches as input while AlexNet and GoogLeNet are originally designed for the fixed image dimension of 256\times 256\times 3 pixels.We also reduced the filter size, stride and pooling parameters of AlexNet and GoogLeNet to accommodate a smaller input size of 64\times 64\times 3 pixels.We do so to produce and evaluate “simplified” AlexNet and GoogLeNet versions that are better suited to the smaller scale training datasets common in CADe problems.Throughout the paper, we refer to the models as CifarNet (32x32) or CifarNet (dropping 32x32); AlexNet (256x256) or AlexNet-H (high resolution); AlexNet (64x64) or AlexNet-L (low resolution); GoogLeNet (256x256) or GoogLeNet-H and GoogLeNet (64x64) or GoogLeNet-L (dropping 3 since all image inputs are three channels). The AlexNet architecture was published in [4], achieved significantly improved performance over the other non-deep learning methods for ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012.This success has revived the interest in CNNs [3] in computer vision.ImageNet consists of 1.2 million 256\times 256 images belonging to 1000 categories.At times, the objects in the image are small and obscure, and thus pose more challenges for learning a successful classification model.More details about the ImageNet dataset will be discussed in Sec.

In this work, we mainly focus on AlexNet and GoogLeNet. AlexNet is the first notably successful CNN architecture on the ImageNet challenge and has rekindled significant research interests on CNN. GoogLeNet is the state-of-the-art deep model, which has outperformed other notable models, such as AlexNet, OverFeat, and VGGNet [67, 68] in various computer vision benchmarks. Likewise, a reasonable assumption is that OverFeat and VGGNet may generate quantitative performance results ranked between AlexNet’s and GoogLeNet’s.

On mediastinal LN detection, we surpass all currently reported results.We obtain 86\% sensitivity on 3 false positives (FP) per patient, versus the prior state-of-art sensitivities of 78\% [36] (stacked shallow learning) and 70\% [22] (CNN), as prior state-of-the-art. For the first time, ILD classification results under the patient-level five-fold cross-validation protocol (CV5) are investigated and reported. The ILD dataset [37] contains 905 annotated image slices with 120 patients and 6 ILD labels. Such sparsely annotated datasets are generally difficult for CNN learning, due to the paucity of labeled instances. In this paper, we exploit and extensively evaluate three important, previously under-studied factors on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture, dataset characteristics, and transfer learning.We evaluate CNN performance on two different computer-aided diagnosis applications: thoraco-abdominal lymph node detection and interstitial lung disease classification.The empirical evaluation, CNN model visualization, CNN performance analysis, and conclusive insights can be generalized to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks. Until the detection aggregation approach [22, 41], thoracoabdominal lymph node (LN) detection via CADe mechanisms has yielded poor performance results. In [22], each 3D LN candidate produces up to 100 random 2.5D orthogonally sampled images or views which are then used to train an effective CNN model. The best performance on abdominal LN detection is achieved at 83\% recall on 3FP per patient [22], using a “Cifar-10” CNN. Using the thoracoabdominal LN detection datasets [22], we aim to surpass this CADe performance level, by testing different CNN architectures, exploring various dataset re-sampling protocols, and applying transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained CNN models."
What was the model that achieved the best performance on abdominal LN Detection?,A supervised neural rescorer based on BM25,The best performing model for abdominal LN detection was a Cifar-10 CNN.,"Until the detection aggregation approach [22, 41], thoracoabdominal lymph node (LN) detection via CADe mechanisms has yielded poor performance results.

What are the reasons and goals behind image sampling ?,"Mask R-CNN adds a segmentation mask output, requiring pixel-to-pixel alignment, whereas Faster R-CNN only has class and bounding box outputs","Image sampling is useful for data augmentation to create larger datasets for training, and can also be used to balance the number of data per class during the data augmentation process.","There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: 1) training the “CNN from scratch” [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]; 2) using “off-the-shelf CNN” features (without retraining the CNN) as complementary information channels to existing hand-crafted image features, for Chest X-rays [10] and CT lung nodule identification [9, 12]; and 3) performing unsupervised pre-training on natural or medical images and fine-tuning on medical target images using CNN or other types of deep learning models [18, 19, 20, 21].A decompositional 2.5D view resampling and an aggregation of random view classification scores are used to eliminate the “curse-of-dimensionality” issue in [22], in order to acquire a sufficient number of training image samples. Medical datasets are often “biased”, in that the number of healthy samples is much larger than the number of diseased instances, or that the numbers of images per class are uneven. In ILD dataset, the number of fibrosis samples is about 3.5 times greater than the number of emphysema samples. The number of non-LNs is 3\sim 4 times greater than the number of LNs in lymph node detection. Different sampling or resampling rates are routinely applied to both ILD and LN detection to balance the data sample number or scale per class, as in[22]. We refer this as “Equal Prior”. If we use the same sampling rate, that will lead to a “Biased Prior” across different classes. Evaluation protocols and details are critical to deriving significant empirical findings [34].Our experimental results suggest that different CNN architectures and dataset re-sampling protocols are critical for the LN detection tasks where the amount of labeled training data is sufficient and spatial contexts are local.Since LN images are more flexible than ILD images with respect to resampling and reformatting, LN datasets may be more readily augmented by such image transformations. As a result, LN datasets contain more training and testing data instances (due to data auugmentation) than ILD datasets. They nonetheless remain less comprehensive than natural image datasets, such as ImageNet.Fine-tuning ImageNet-trained models for ILD classification is clearly advantageous and yields early promising results, when the amount of labeled training data is highly insufficient and multi-class categorization is used, as opposed to the LN dataset’s binary class categorization.Another significant finding is that CNNs trained from scratch or fine-tuned from ImageNet models consistently outperform CNNs that merely use off-the-shelf CNN features, in both the LN and ILD classification problems. We further analyze, via CNN activation visualizations, when and why transfer learning from non-medical to medical images in CADe problems can be valuable."
What are the difference between lymph nodes and the hear or liver?,"No. While data augmentation can be highly effective in improving the performance of a segmentation network, it is not always sufficient to support good performance. Other factors, such as the quality and quantity of the training data, the network architecture, and the specific task requirements, also play a crucial role in determining the performance of the segmentation model","Lymph nodes have no predetermined orientation relative to the human anatomy, while the heart and liver do.","Unlike the heart or the liver, lymph nodes have no pre-determined anatomic orientation. Hence, the purely random image resampling (with respect to scale, displacement and orientation) and reformatting (the axial, coronal, and sagittal views are in any system randomly resampled coordinates) is a natural choice, which also happens to yield high CNN performance. Although we integrate three channels of information from three orthogonal views for LN detection, the pixel-wise spatial correlations between or among channels are not necessary. The convolutional kernels in the lower level CNN architectures can learn the optimal weights to linearly combine the observations from the axial, coronal, and sagittal channels by computing their dot-products.Transforming axial, coronal, and sagittal representations to RGB also facilitates transfer learning from CNN models trained on ImageNet."

How many images did the dataset consist of and the number of unique patients ?,"Using max-pooling, min-pooling, or mean-pooling instead of concat-pooling would likely increase memory utilization during training",The ILD dataset has 905 image slices from 120 patients.,"Interstitial Lung Disease Dataset. We utilize the publicly available dataset of [37]. It contains 905 image slices from 120 patients, with six lung tissue types annotations containing at least one of the following: healthy (NM), emphysema (EM), ground glass (GG), fibrosis (FB), micronodules (MN) and consolidation (CD) (Figure 3).At the slice level, the objective is to classify the status of “presence/absence” of any of the six ILD classes for an input axial CT slice [40].Characterizing an arbitrary CT slice against any possible ILD type, without any manual ROI (in contrast to [38, 39]), can be useful for large-scale patient screening.For slice-level ILD classification, we sampled the slices 12 times with random translations and rotations.After this, we balanced the numbers of CT slice samples for the six classes by randomly sampling several instances at various rates.For patch-based classification, we sampled up to 100 patches of size 64\times 64 from each ROI.This dataset is divided into five folds with disjoint patient subsets.The average number of CT slices (training instances) per fold is small, as shown in Table I.Slice-level ILD classification is a very challenging task where CNN models need to learn from very small numbers of training examples and predict ILD labels on unseen patients."
What are the six classes of the data used for training ?,"The model should be adapted to handle different basic units for different languages.

The author considered this aspect by using language-dependent segmentation tools to identify phrases in other languages, such as Chinese. However, the model may still require further adjustments to account for differences in basic units between languages","The six classes are healthy, emphysema, ground glass, fibrosis, micronodules, and consolidation.","Interstitial Lung Disease Dataset. We utilize the publicly available dataset of [37]. It contains 905 image slices from 120 patients, with six lung tissue types annotations containing at least one of the following: healthy (NM), emphysema (EM), ground glass (GG), fibrosis (FB), micronodules (MN) and consolidation (CD) (Figure 3). At the slice level, the objective is to classify the status of “presence/absence” of any of the six ILD classes for an input axial CT slice [40]. Characterizing an arbitrary CT slice against any possible ILD type, without any manual ROI (in contrast to [38], [39]), can be useful for large-scale patient screening. For slice-level ILD classification, we sampled the slices 12 times with random translations and rotations. After this, we balanced the numbers of CT slice samples for the six classes by randomly sampling several instances at various rates.

How did the authors leverage the CNN architectures designed for color images and to transfer CNN parameters pre-trained on ImageNet to be able to use it on the medical dataset ?,"Yes, the β-VAE's objective controls overlap","The authors transformed every gray-scale axial CT image using the three CT windows of lung window range [-1400, -200HU], high-attenuation range [-160, 240HU], and low-attenuation range [-1400; -950HU], then encoded the transformed images into RGB images.","To leverage the CNN architectures designed for color images and to transfer CNN parameters pre-trained on ImageNet, we transform all gray-scale axial CT slice images via three CT window ranges: lung window range [-1400, -200HU], high-attenuation range [-160, 240HU], and low-attenuation range [-1400; -950HU]. We then encode the transformed images into RGB channels (to be aligned with the input channels of CNN models [4], [33] pre-trained from natural image datasets [1]). The low-attenuation CT window is useful for visualizing certain texture patterns of lung diseases (especially emphysema). The usage of different CT attenuation channels improves classification results over the usage of a single CT windowing channel, as demonstrated in [40]. More importantly, these CT windowing processes do not depend on the lung segmentation, which instead is directly defined in the CT HU space. Figure 4 shows a representative example of lung, high-attenuation, and low-attenuation CT windowing for an axis lung CT slice."
How does CNN model learns to ignore areas that appear in both healthy and diseased lungs?,Monolingual and multilingual,The model learns very small weights in the filters for such areas.,"As observed in [40], lung segmentation is crucial to holistic slice-level ILD classification. We empirically compare performance in two scenarios with a rough lung segmentation111This can be achieved by segmenting the lung using simple label-fusion methods [48]. In the first case, we overlay the target image slice with the average lung mask among the training folds. In the second, we perform simple morphology operations to obtain the lung boundary. In order to retain information from the inside of the lung, we apply Gaussian smoothing to the regions outside of the lung boundary. There is no significant difference between two setups. Due to the high precision of CNN based image processing, highly accurate lung segmentation is not necessary . The localization of ILD regions within the lung is simultaneously learned through selectively weighted CNN reception fields in the deepest convolutional layers during the classification based CNN training [49, 50].Some areas outside of the lung appear in both healthy or diseased images. CNN training learns to ignore them by setting very small filter weights around the corresponding regions (Figure 13). This observation is validated by [40]."
What was the goal behind reducing the filter size and stride of the ALexNet and GoogLeNet ?,"Text-based image generation applications, including recontextualization, property modification, original art renditions, and more",The authors reduced the filter size and stride of the two models because the input size used was smaller than what the original models were trained on.,"We use CifarNet [5] as used in [22] as a baseline for the LN detection.AlexNet [4] and GoogLeNet [33] are also modified to evaluate these state-of-the-art CNN architecture from ImageNet classification task [2] to our CADe problems and datasets.A simplified illustration of three CNN architectures exploited is shown in Figure 5.CifarNet always takes 32\times 32\times 3 image patches as input while AlexNet and GoogLeNet are originally designed for the fixed image dimension of 256\times 256\times 3 pixels.We also reduced the filter size, stride and pooling parameters of AlexNet and GoogLeNet to accommodate a smaller input size of 64\times 64\times 3 pixels.We do so to produce and evaluate “simplified” AlexNet and GoogLeNet versions that are better suited to the smaller scale training datasets common in CADe problems.Throughout the paper, we refer to the models as CifarNet (32x32) or CifarNet (dropping 32x32); AlexNet (256x256) or AlexNet-H (high resolution); AlexNet (64x64) or AlexNet-L (low resolution); GoogLeNet (256x256) or GoogLeNet-H and GoogLeNet (64x64) or GoogLeNet-L (dropping 3 since all image inputs are three channels)."
What is CifarNet?,"Yes.

Tune-A-Video is inspired by transformer networks, as it builds upon pre-trained T2I diffusion models and extends them with spatio-temporal cross-frame attention, similar to the self-attention mechanism in transformer networks",CifarNet was a CNN model that was used for the object recognition task using the Cifar10 dataset.,"CifarNet, introduced in [5], was the state-of-the-art model for object recognition on the Cifar10 dataset, which consists of 32\times 32 images of 10 object classes.The objects are normally centered in the images.Some example images and class categories from the Cifar10 dataset are shown in Figure 7.CifarNet has three convolution layers, three pooling layers, and one fully-connected layer.This CNN architecture, also used in [22] has about 0.15 million free parameters.We adopt it as a baseline model for the LN detection."
How was the CNN parameters initialized?,Independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) datasets,Parameters were initialized by sampling from random Gaussian distributions.,"When learned from scratch, all the parameters of CNN models are initialized with random Gaussian distributions and trained for 30 epochs with the mini-batch size of 50 image instances.Training convergence can be observed within 30 epochs. The other hyperparameters are momentum: 0.9; weight decay: 0.0005; (base) learning rate: 0.01, decreased by a factor of 10 at every 10 epochs. We use the Caffe framework [56] and NVidia K40 GPUs to train the CNNs."
What are the models that yielded the least competitive detection accuracy results on the Thoracoabdominal Lymph Node Detection?,"The key reasons behind Mask R-CNN outperforming all the winners of COCO 2015-2016 are the introduction of a third branch for object mask prediction, which requires pixel-to-pixel alignment, and the decoupling of mask and class prediction","CifarNet, AlexNet-ImNet and GoogLeNet-RI-H were the models that had the worst results.","Results for lymph node detection in the mediastinum and abdomen are reported in Table II.FROC curves are illustrated in Figure 8.The area-under-the-FROC-curve (AUC) and true positive rate (TPR, recall or sensitivity) at three false positives per patient (TPR/3FP) are used as performance metrics.Of the nine investigated CNN models, CifarNet, AlexNet-ImNet and GoogLeNet-RI-H generally yielded the least competitive detection accuracy results.Our LN datasets are significantly more complex (i.e., display much larger within-class appearance variations), especially due to the extracted fields-of-view (FOVs) of (35mm-128mm) compared to (30mm-45mm) in [22], where CifarNet is also employed.In this experiment, CifarNet is under-trained with respect to our enhanced LN datasets, due to its limited input resolution and parameter complexity.The inferior performance of AlexNet-ImNet implies that using the pre-trained ImageNet CNNs alone as “off-the-shelf” deep image feature extractors may not be optimal or adequate for mediastinal and abdominal LN detection tasks.To complement “off-the-shelf” CNN features, [10, 9, 12] all add and integrate various other hand-crafted image features as hybrid inputs for the final CADe classification."
Why did the GoogLENet-RI-H performs poorly in the Thoracoabdominal Lymph Node Detection task?,"Based on the context provided, the uses of approximate posterior inference of the latent variable z given an observed value x for parameters θ include:

1. Efficient approximate ML or MAP estimation for the parameters θ.
2. Efficient approximate posterior inference of the latent variable z given an observed value x for a choice of parameters θ.
3. Efficient approximate marginal inference of the variable x.

These uses are relevant in computer vision applications such as image denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution, where the ability to perform efficient inference on the latent variables and the parameters of the generative model is important. Additionally, the recognition model q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) can be interpreted as a probabilistic encoder, and p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}) as a probabilistic decoder, which can be useful in coding theory and data representation tasks","The model suffers from over-fitting, as it is a very complex model but it does not have enough training data for training.","GoogLeNet-RI-H performs poorly, as it is susceptible to over-fitting. No sufficient data samples are available to train GoogLeNet-RI-H with random initialization.Indeed, due to GoogLeNet-RI-H’s complexity and 22-layer depth, million-image datasets may be required to properly train this model.However, GoogLeNet-TL-H significantly improves upon GoogLeNet-RI-H (0.81 versus 0.61 TPR/3FP in mediastinum; 0.70 versus 0.48 TPR/3FP in abdomen). This indicates that transfer learning offers a much better initialization of CNN parameters than random initialization. Likewise, AlexNet-TL-H consistently outperforms AlexNet-RI-H, though by smaller margins (0.81 versus 0.79 TPR/3FP in mediastinum; 0.69 versus 0.67 TPR/3FP in abdomen). This is also consistent with the findings reported for ILD detection in Table III and Figure 11."
What is the best performing CNN model in the abdominal LN detection?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

These numbers represent the perplexity of the language model on the holdout data set, which is a common measure of progress in language modeling. In this case, a lower perplexity value indicates a better fit of the model to the data, and a value of 51.3 or 30.0 would indicate that the model is performing well on the given task",The best performing model is GoogLeNet-TL.,"Many of our CNN models achieve notably better (FROC-AUC and TPR/3FP) results than the previous state-of-the-art models [36] for mediastinal LN detection: GoogLeNet-RI-L obtains an AUC=0.95 and 0.85 TPR/3FP, versus AUC=0.92 and 0.70 TPR/3FP [22] and 0.78 TPR/3FP [36] which uses stacked shallow learning.This difference lies in the fact that annotated lymph node segmentation masks are required to learn a mid-level semantic boundary detector [36], whereas CNN approaches only need LN locations for training [22]. In abdominal LN detection, [22] obtains the best trade-off between its CNN model complexity and sampled data configuration. Our best performing CNN model is GoogLeNet-TL (256x256) which obtains an AUC=0.92 and 0.70 TPR/3FP."
What is the difference between five-fold cross validation and leave-one-patient out?,The authors used a distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approach for training the distilled models,LOO performs better than five-fold cross validation.,"To investigate the performance difference between five-fold cross-validation (CV) in Sec. IV-B and leave-one-patient-out (LOO) validation, this experiment is performed under the LOO protocol. By comparing results in Table III (CV-5) to those in Table VI (LOO), one can see that LOO’s quantitative performances are remarkably better than CV-5’s. For example, in ILD slice-level classification, the accuracy level drastically increases from 0.46 to 0.867 using AlexNet-TL, and from 0.57 to 0.902 for GoogLeNet-TL."
How is the original ILD images were reconstructed ?,"Through cross-attention layers that produce spatial attention maps for each textual token, the embeddings of visual and textual features are fused during the noise prediction process","A process consisting of deconvolution, back-propagation with convolution, and un-pooling from the activation maps of the pooling units was used to reconstruct the original ILD images.","The last pooling layer (pool-5) activation maps of the ImageNet pre-trained AlexNet [4] (analogical to AlexNet-ImNet) and AlexNet-TL, obtained by processing two input images of Figure 2 (b,c), are shown in Figure 13 (a,b). The last pooling layer activation map summarizes the entire input image by highlighting which relative locations or neural reception fields relative to the image are activated. There are a total of 256 (6x6) reception fields in AlexNet [4]. Pooling units where the relative image location of the disease region is present in the image are highlighted with green boxes. Next, we reconstruct the original ILD images using the process of de-convolution, back-propagating with convolution and un-pooling from the activation maps of the chosen pooling units [72]. From the reconstructed images (Figure 13 bottom), we observe that with fine-tuning, AlexNet-TL detects and localizes objects of interest (ILD disease regions depicted in in Figure 2 (b) and (c)) better than AlexNet-ImNet. The filters shown in Figure 13 that better localize regions on the input images (Figure 2 (b) and (c)) respectively, produce relatively higher activations (in the top 5%) among all 512 reception field responses in the fine-tuned AlexNet-TL model. As observed in [73], the final CNN classification score can not be driven solely by a single strong activation in the receptions fields, but often by a sparse set of high activations (i.e., varying selective or sparse activations per input image)."
Was Transfer learning beneficial on the CADe process? ,Yes,"Transfer learning was shown to be beneficial in the paper's experiments, as seen by the differences in performance between AlexNet-TL/GoogLeNet-TL and their non-transfer learning counterparts.","While it is a more practical CADe scheme, slice-level CNN learning [40] is very challenging, as it is restricted to only 905 CT image slices with tagged ILD labels. We only benchmark the slice-level ILD classification results in this section. Even with the help of data augmentation (described in Sec. II), the classification accuracy of GoogLeNet-TL from Table III is only 0.57. However, transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained model is consistently beneficial, as evidenced by AlexNet-TL (0.46) versus AlexNet-RI (0.44), and GoogLeNet-TL (0.57) versus GoogLeNet-RI (0.41). It especially prevents GoogLeNet from over-fitting on the limited CADe datasets. Finally, when the cross-validation is conducted by randomly splitting the set of all 905 CT axial slices into five folds, markedly higher F-scores are obtained (Slice-Random in Table IV). This further validates the claim that the dataset poorly generalizes ILDs for different patients. Figure 10 shows examples of misclassified ILD patches (in axial view), with their ground truth labels and inaccurately classified labels. •Deep CNN architectures with 8, even 22 layers [4, 33], can be useful even for CADe problems where the available training datasets are limited. Previously, CNN models used in medical image analysis applications have often been 2\sim 5 orders of magnitude smaller.•The trade-off between using better learning models and using more training data [51] should be carefully considered when searching for an optimal solution to any CADe problem (e.g., mediastinal and abdominal LN detection).•Limited datasets can be a bottleneck to further advancement of CADe.

How the CADe problem can be improved? ,"Performance was evaluated using Table 4, which compares the models based on three sets: RGB data, explicitly computed flow features, and both",They can be improved by either training CNNs from scratch and fine-tuning them or using hand-crafted features.,"•Deep CNN architectures with 8, even 22 layers [4, 33], can be useful even for CADe problems where the available training datasets are limited.

What is the used model inspired from?,interference among different knowledge graphs (KGs) leading to forgetting previously learned knowledge when training on new KGs,It was inspired by VGG-net.,"We present a highly accurate single-image superresolution (SR) method. Our method uses a very deep convolutional network inspired by VGG-net used for ImageNet classification [19]. We find increasing our network depth shows a significant improvement in accuracy. Our final model uses 20 weight layers. By cascading small filters many times in a deep network structure, contextual information over large image regions is exploited in an efficient way. With very deep networks, however, convergence speed becomes a critical issue during training. We propose a simple yet effective training procedure. We learn residuals only and use extremely high learning rates (104 times higher than SRCNN [6]) enabled by adjustable gradient clipping. Our proposed method performs better than existing methods in accuracy and visual improvements in our results are easily noticeable."
Did increasing the network depth improved the results?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The authors verify that searching in a small supernet and then scaling is a good tactic to search for a big network by comparing the performance of the scaled network with the direct search results","Yes, it did boost performance.","However, we argue that increasing depth significantly boosts performance. We successfully use 20 weight layers (3\times 3 for each layer). Our network is very deep (20 vs. 3 [6]) and information used for reconstruction (receptive field) is much larger (41\times 41 vs. 13\times 13). In this section, we study three properties of our proposed method. First, we show that large depth is necessary for the task of SR. A very deep network utilizes more contextual information in an image and models complex functions with many nonlinear layers. We experimentally verify that deeper networks give better performances than shallow ones. We now experimentally show that very deep networks significantly improve SR performance. We train and test networks of depth ranging from 5 to 20 (only counting weight layers excluding nonlinearity layers). In Figure 3, we show the results. In most cases, performance increases as depth increases. As depth increases, performance improves rapidly. In this work, we have presented a super-resolution method using very deep networks. Training a very deep network is hard due to a slow convergence rate. We use residual-learning and extremely high learning rates to optimize a very deep network fast. Convergence speed is maximized and we use gradient clipping to ensure the training stability. We have demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing method by a large margin on benchmarked images. We believe our approach is readily applicable to other image restoration problems such as denoising and compression artifact removal."
What is the issue that come with very deep networks?,"For both plain and highway networks, the following hyperparameters were used for training:

* Initial learning rate: 0.01
* Momentum: 0.9
* Learning rate exponential decay factor: 0.5
* Activation function: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
* Initial value for transform gate bias (for highway networks): -5.

These hyperparameters were selected based on a random search of 100 runs for both plain and highway networks, and were kept fixed for all experiments","Training is difficult for very deep networks as they have many parameters and it takes a long time for them to converge. Also, since convolutional layers shrink feature maps, having too deep a network could be bad.","One problem with using a very deep network to predict dense outputs is that the size of the feature map gets reduced every time convolution operations are applied. For example, when an input of size (n+1)\times(n+1) is applied to a network with receptive field size n\times n, the output image is 1\times 1. High Learning Rates for Very Deep NetworksTraining deep models can fail to converge in realistic limit of time. SRCNN [6] fails to show superior performance with more than three weight layers. While there can be various reasons, one possibility is that they stopped their training procedure before networks converged. Their learning rate 10^{-5} is too small for a network to converge within a week on a common GPU. Looking at Fig. 9 of [6], it is not easy to say their deeper networks have converged and their performances were saturated. While more training will eventually resolve the issue, but increasing depth to 20 does not seems practical with SRCNN. Multi-Scale While very deep models can boost performance, more parameters are now needed to define a network. Typically, one network is created for each scale factor. Considering that fractional scale factors are often used, we need an economical way to store and retrieve networks. In this work, we have presented a super-resolution method using very deep networks. Training a very deep network is hard due to a slow convergence rate. We use residual-learning and extremely high learning rates to optimize a very deep network fast. Convergence speed is maximized and we use gradient clipping to ensure the training stability. We have demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing method by a large margin on benchmarked images. We believe our approach is readily applicable to other image restoration problems such as denoising and compression artifact removal."
What is single image super-resolution?,"In the NQ dataset, ""real information seeking queries"" refers to queries that are more similar to the types of questions people would ask when seeking information, as opposed to other datasets like BioASQ and Forum, which contain more specific and targeted questions",Single image super-resolution is the task of generating a high-resolution image from a low-resolution one.,"We address the problem of generating a high-resolution (HR) image given a low-resolution (LR) image, commonly referred as single image super-resolution (SISR) [12], [8], [9]. SISR is widely used in computer vision applications ranging from security and surveillance imaging to medical imaging where more image details are required on demand."
What are the applications of SISR?,"Yes, English pretrained language models are good at transferring to other languages, despite never having seen the target language before. This is due to the presence of small amounts of non-English text in the pretraining corpus, which acts as a source of signal for cross-lingual transfer",SISR is used in computer vision applications such as surveillance imaging and medical image to enhance low-resolution images.,"We address the problem of generating a high-resolution (HR) image given a low-resolution (LR) image, commonly referred as single image super-resolution (SISR) [12], [8], [9]. SISR is widely used in computer vision applications ranging from security and surveillance imaging to medical imaging where more image details are required on demand."
Give examples of learning methods that are used in mapping from LR to HR?,A depthwise separable convolution is a way of factorizing a standard convolution into two separate layers: a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution. It reduces computation and model size by separating the filtering and combining steps into two separate layers,"Neighbor embedding, sparse coding, random forests and CNN have been used to map from LR to HR.","Currently, learning methods are widely used to model a mapping from LR to HR patches. Neighbor embedding [4, 15] methods interpolate the patch subspace. Sparse coding [25, 26, 21, 22] methods use a learned compact dictionary based on sparse signal representation. Lately, random forest [18] and convolutional neural network (CNN) [6] have also been used with large improvements in accuracy. Among them, Dong et al. [6] has demonstrated that a CNN can be used to learn a mapping from LR to HR in an end-to-end manner. Their method, termed SRCNN, does not require any engineered features that are typically necessary in other methods [25, 26, 21, 22] and shows the state-of-the-art performance."
What are the limitations of the SRCNN in the SISR task?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

+20% relative improvement over other benchmarks for image retrieval","It requires context from small image regions, it converges too slowly during training, and the network only works for one set scale.","Scale As in most existing SR methods, SRCNN is trained for a single scale factor and is supposed to work only with the specified scale. Thus, if a new scale is on demand, a new model has to be trained. To cope with multiple scale SR (possibly including fractional factors), we need to construct individual single scale SR system for each scale of interest. While SRCNN successfully introduced a deep learning technique into the super-resolution (SR) problem, we find its limitations in three aspects: first, it relies on the context of small image regions; second, training converges too slowly; third, the network only works for a single scale. We provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Compared methods are A+ [22], RFL[18], SelfEx [11] and SRCNN [5]. In Table 3, we provide a summary of quantitative evaluation on several datasets. Our methods outperform all previous methods in these datasets. Moreover, our methods are relatively fast. The public code of SRCNN based on a CPU implementation is slower than the code used by Dong et. al [6] in their paper based on a GPU implementation."
How did the authors speed up the training?,"The local model only considers entity links as potential antecedents for a mention span, while the global model uses bidirectional connections between mentions to overcome the limitation of the local model","The authors used residual learning, extremely high learning rates, and adjustable gradient clipping.","It is a basic rule of thumb to make learning rate high to boost training. But simply setting learning rate high can also lead to vanishing/exploding gradients [2]. For the reason, we suggest an adjustable gradient clipping for maximal boost in speed while suppressing exploding gradients. For maximal speed of convergence, we clip the gradients to [-\frac{\theta}{\gamma},\frac{\theta}{\gamma}], where \gamma denotes the current learning rate. We find the adjustable gradient clipping makes our convergence procedure extremely fast. Our 20-layer network training is done within 4 hours whereas 3-layer SRCNN takes several days to train. Convergence We suggest a way to speed-up the training: residual-learning CNN and extremely high learning rates. As LR image and HR image share the same information to a large extent, explicitly modelling the residual image, which is the difference between HR and LR images, is advantageous. We propose a network structure for efficient learning when input and output are highly correlated. Moreover, our initial learning rate is 10^{4} times higher than that of SRCNN [6]. This is enabled by residual-learning and gradient clipping."
What is the goal behind using a single model SR approach?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

No, the authors do not measure the impact of using RELU6 instead of RELU on their model's performance","Existing methods are only trained for a single scale, so adapting them to other scales requires retraining. However, this would be impractical, so having a single model that accepts multiple scales would fix the problem.","Scale As in most existing SR methods, SRCNN is trained for a single scale factor and is supposed to work only with the specified scale. Thus, if a new scale is on demand, a new model has to be trained. To cope with multiple scale SR (possibly including fractional factors), we need to construct individual single scale SR system for each scale of interest. However, preparing many individual machines for all possible scenarios to cope with multiple scales is inefficient and impractical.In this work, we design and train a single network to handle multiple scale SR problem efficiently. This turns out to work very well. Our single machine is compared favorably to a single-scale expert for the given sub-task. For three scales factors (×2,3,4\times 2,3,4× 2 , 3 , 4), we can reduce the number of parameters by three-fold. Scale Factor We propose a single-model SR approach. Scales are typically user-specified and can be arbitrary including fractions. For example, one might need smooth zoom-in in an image viewer or resizing to a specific dimension. Training and storing many scale-dependent models in preparation for all possible scenarios is impractical. We find a single convolutional network is sufficient for multi-scale-factor super-resolution. Contribution In summary, in this work, we propose a highly accurate SR method based on a very deep convolutional network. Very deep networks converge too slowly if small learning rates are used. Boosting convergence rate with high learning rates lead to exploding gradients and we resolve the issue with residual-learning and gradient clipping. In addition, we extend our work to cope with multi-scale SR problem in a single network. Our method is relatively accurate and fast in comparison to state-of-the-art methods as illustrated in Figure 1."
What is the goal behind constructing individual single scale SR system?,"Using white noise instead of other types of noise like Salt-and-pepper or Gaussian noise has several benefits for content and style transfer in deep neural networks.

First, white noise has a flat power spectral density, which means it contains equal amounts of power at all frequencies. This allows the network to learn more generalizable features that are less sensitive to specific frequencies or patterns in the data. In contrast, Salt-and-pepper noise has a high frequency component that may not be desirable for certain tasks. Gaussian noise, on the other hand, has a heavy tail, which may make it more difficult to train the network.

Second, white noise is a more efficient choice because it has a lower variance than other types of noise. This means that the network needs to be trained on less data to achieve the same level of performance, which can reduce the risk of overfitting.

Finally, white noise is a more convenient choice because it is easy to generate and manipulate. It can be sampled from a uniform distribution, which makes it easy to control the amount of noise added to the network. In contrast, Salt-and-pepper noise is more difficult to generate and manipulate, and Gaussian noise requires more careful parameter tuning to achieve the desired level of noise","Since SRCNN is only trained for a single scale, we need to train individual single scale SRCNNs to deal with multiple scales.","Scale As in most existing SR methods, SRCNN is trained for a single scale factor and is supposed to work only with the specified scale. Thus, if a new scale is on demand, a new model has to be trained. To cope with multiple scale SR (possibly including fractional factors), we need to construct individual single scale SR system for each scale of interest."
What are the layers of the Model SRCNN?,Yes,"SRCNN has three layers in the following order: patch extraction/representation, non-linear mapping, and reconstruction.","ModelSRCNN consists of three layers: patch extraction/representation, non-linear mapping and reconstruction. Filters of spatial sizes 9\times 9, 1\times 1, and 5\times 5 were used respectively."
What is the difference between the learning rate of the SRCNN and the learning rate of the proposed model?,The probability of dropping each path in the cell is linearly increased over the course of training,"Not only does SRCNN uses different learning rates for its layers, while the proposed model uses the same learning rate for all of its layers, but the proposed model's initial learning rate is also 10000 times greater than SRCNN's.","In addition to the aforementioned issues, there are some minor differences. Our output image has the same size as the input image by padding zeros every layer during training whereas output from SRCNN is smaller than the input. Finally, we simply use the same learning rates for all layers while SRCNN uses different learning rates for different layers in order to achieve stable convergence. Convergence We suggest a way to speed-up the training: residual-learning CNN and extremely high learning rates. As LR image and HR image share the same information to a large extent, explicitly modelling the residual image, which is the difference between HR and LR images, is advantageous. We propose a network structure for efficient learning when input and output are highly correlated. Moreover, our initial learning rate is 10^{4} times higher than that of SRCNN [6]. This is enabled by residual-learning and gradient clipping."
What are the reasons of using residual learning ?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Hierarchical features benefit scene understanding by capturing local context at multiple scales, allowing for the labeling of objects with varying sizes and the comprehension of scenes at multiple levels","Residual learning solves the vanishing/exploding gradients problem, allowing for the model to converge faster and perform better.","Residual-Learning In SRCNN, the exact copy of the input has to go through all layers until it reaches the output layer. With many weight layers, this becomes an end-to-end relation requiring very long-term memory. For this reason, the vanishing/exploding gradients problem [2] can be critical. We can solve this problem simply with residual-learning. Second, we show that our residual-learning network converges much faster than the standard CNN. Moreover, our network gives a significant boost in performance. First, we find that this residual network converges much faster. Two networks are compared experimentally: the residual network and the standard non-residual network. We use depth 10 (weight layers) and scale factor 2. Performance curves for various learning rates are shown in Figure 4. All use the same learning rate scheduling mechanism that has been mentioned above. Second, at convergence, the residual network shows superior performance. In Figure 4, residual networks give higher PSNR when training is done. Another remark is that if small learning rates are used, networks do not converge in the given number of epochs. If initial learning rate 0.1 is used, PSNR of a residual-learning network reaches 36.90 within 10 epochs. But if 0.001 is used instead, the network never reaches the same level of performance (its performance is 36.52 after 80 epochs). In a similar manner, residual and non-residual networks show dramatic performance gaps after 10 epochs (36.90 vs. 27.42 for rate 0.1)."
How the loss was calculated in the proposed model ?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

No.

The reason is that the grouping matrix decomposition step via SVD is a cubic-time operation, and incorporating faster decomposition methods would not reduce the overall cubic cost of GMPool. Therefore, it is not possible to reduce the asymptotic cost of GMPool from cubic to quadratic while retaining its expressive power",The loss is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the reconstructed image and the ground truth image.,"As the input and output images are largely similar, we define a residual image {\bf r}={\bf y}-{\bf x}, where most values are likely to be zero or small. We want to predict this residual image. The loss function now becomes \frac{1}{2}||\mathbf{r}-f(\mathbf{x})||^{2}, where f(\bf{x}) is the network prediction. In networks, this is reflected in the loss layer as follows.Our loss layer takes three inputs: residual estimate, network input (ILR image) and ground truth HR image. The loss is computed as the Euclidean distance between the reconstructed image (the sum of network input and output) and ground truth."
What was the momentum value used?,"Sure! Based on the context you provided, the answer to your question is:

905 images and 120 unique patients",Momentum was set to 0.9.,"Training is carried out by optimizing the regression objective using mini-batch gradient descent based on back-propagation (LeCun et al. [14]). We set the momentum parameter to 0.9. The training is regularized by weight decay (L_{2} penalty multiplied by0.0001). We provide parameters used to train our final model. We use a network of depth 20. Training uses batches of size 64. Momentum and weight decay parameters are set to 0.9 and 0.0001, respectively."
What is gradient clipping?,Zalando is Europe's largest online fashion platform,Gradient clipping is a technique often used in training RNNs that alters hyperparameters such that the gradients are always within a certain range.,"Adjustable Gradient ClippingGradient clipping is a technique that is often used in training recurrent neural networks [17]. But, to our knowledge, its usage is limited in training CNNs. While there exist many ways to limit gradients, one of the common strategies is to clip individual gradients to the predefined range[-\theta,\theta]. With clipping, gradients are in a certain range. With stochastic gradient descent commonly used for training, learning rate is multiplied to adjust the step size. If high learning rate is used, it is likely that \theta is tuned to be small to avoid exploding gradients in a high learning rate regime. But as learning rate is annealed to get smaller, the effective gradient (gradient multiplied by learning rate) approaches zero and training can take exponentially many iterations to converge if learning rate is decreased geometrically."
Compare the training time of the proposed network to the SRCNN ?,"Open loop refers to a system that does not use continuous visual feedback to adjust its actions. Instead, it relies on pre-processed information and pre-defined rules to make decisions. In the context of grasping, open loop systems observe the scene prior to the grasp, extract image patches, and use a known camera calibration to move the gripper to a predetermined location, without considering the current state of the environment",The proposed method is much faster than SRCNN by a scale of 10 or more.,"For maximal speed of convergence, we clip the gradients to [-\frac{\theta}{\gamma},\frac{\theta}{\gamma}], where \gamma denotes the current learning rate. We find the adjustable gradient clipping makes our convergence procedure extremely fast. Our 20-layer network training is done within 4 hours whereas 3-layer SRCNN takes several days to train.

What was the goal behind train a multi-scale model ?,No,"Single-scale models can only be used for one scale, so a new model must be trained for new scales. However, this would take too long, so a multi-scale model that uses the same parameters no matter the scale would reduce model capacity and make training more efficient.","Scale As in most existing SR methods, SRCNN is trained for a single scale factor and is supposed to work only with the specified scale.

Difference between data preparation for the proposed model and the SRCNN?,"The hyperparameter of the proposed method is the learning rate, which is tuned using a linear warmup followed by cosine scheduling","The proposed model's input size is the same as the receptive field size, and images were divided with no overlap.","Data preparation is similar to SRCNN [5] with some differences. Input patch size is now equal to the size of the receptive field and images are divided into sub-images with no overlap. A mini-batch consists of 64 sub-images, where sub-images from different scales can be in the same batch."
What are the main three properties of the model studied in this paper?,"The hyperparameters for the baseline methods were chosen using grid search across candidates, as described in previous work. The chosen values for the experiments presented are provided in the appendix","They study the deepness of their model, the multi-scale property and how well it performs, and residual learning for faster convergence.","In this section, we study three properties of our proposed method. First, we show that large depth is necessary for the task of SR. A very deep network utilizes more contextual information in an image and models complex functions with many nonlinear layers. We experimentally verify that deeper networks give better performances than shallow ones. Third, we show that our method with a single network performs as well as a method using multiple networks trained for each scale.

How did the authors imporved the accuarcy by making the model deeper but decreased the training time simultaneously?,Intersection over Union (IoU) measures the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth box,They changed the model architecture to multi-scale to reduce model capacity and used residual learning with high learning rates to increase training speed.,"Second, we show that our residual-learning network converges much faster than the standard CNN.

What is the key difference between inductive and transductive learning?,"A significant tradeoff in accuracy is expected when basic network architectures are represented in low-bit computations, as the reduced precision can lead to loss of information and increased error rates","General inductive transfer learning is, given a static source task and any target task where the source task and target task are not equal, to improve the performance of the target task. This occurs by fine-tuning a model that has been pretrained on other datasets. What transductive transfer learning is and the difference between transductive and inductive transfer learning cannot be answered from this paper.","Inductive transfer learning has had a large impact on computer vision (CV). Applied CV models (including object detection, classification, and segmentation) are rarely trained from scratch, but instead are fine-tuned from models that have been pretrained on ImageNet, MS-COCO, and other datasets Sharif Razavian et al. (2014); Long et al. (2015a); He et al. (2016); Huang et al. (2017). We are interested in the most general inductive transfer learning setting for NLP Pan and Yang (2010): Given a static source task \mathcal{T}_{S} and any target task \mathcal{T}_{T} with \mathcal{T}_{S}\neq\mathcal{T}_{T}, we would like to improve performance on \mathcal{T}_{T}. Language modeling can be seen as the ideal source task and a counterpart of ImageNet for NLP: It captures many facets of language relevant for downstream tasks, such as long-term dependencies Linzen et al. (2016), hierarchical relations Gulordava et al. (2018), and sentiment Radford et al. (2017). In contrast to tasks like MT McCann et al. (2017) and entailment Conneau et al. (2017), it provides data in near-unlimited quantities for most domains and languages. Additionally, a pretrained LM can be easily adapted to the idiosyncrasies of a target task, which we show significantly improves performance (see Section 5). Moreover, language modeling already is a key component of existing tasks such as MT and dialogue modeling. Formally, language modeling induces a hypothesis space \mathcal{H} that should be useful for many other NLP tasks Vapnik and Kotz (1982); Baxter (2000). While Deep Learning models have achieved state-of-the-art on many NLP tasks, these models are trained from scratch, requiring large datasets, and days to converge. Research in NLP focused mostly on transductive transfer Blitzer et al. (2007). For inductive transfer, fine-tuning pretrained word embeddings Mikolov et al. (2013), a simple transfer technique that only targets a model’s first layer, has had a large impact in practice and is used in most state-of-the-art models. Recent approaches that concatenate embeddings derived from other tasks with the input at different layers Peters et al. (2017); McCann et al. (2017); Peters et al. (2018) still train the main task model from scratch and treat pretrained embeddings as fixed parameters, limiting their usefulness."
What is catastrophic forgetting?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Yes, training a pre-trained latent space in Optimus leads to higher performance for dialog generation because the whole dialog can be encoded in the latent space. By jointly embedding the history and response in a single latent space, Optimus can capture the long-range dependencies and contextual information in the dialog, leading to more coherent and relevant responses",Catastrophic forgetting involved increasing error as a model start to overfit and knowledge captured through pretraining is lost.,"Fine-tuning the target classifier is the most critical part of the transfer learning method. Overly aggressive fine-tuning will cause catastrophic forgetting, eliminating the benefit of the information captured through language modeling; too cautious fine-tuning will lead to slow convergence (and resultant overfitting). Besides discriminative fine-tuning and triangular learning rates, we propose gradual unfreezing for fine-tuning the classifier. We show that not the idea of LM fine-tuning but our lack of knowledge of how to train them effectively has been hindering wider adoption. LMs overfit to small datasets and suffered catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned with a classifier. Compared to CV, NLP models are typically more shallow and thus require different fine-tuning methods. On all datasets, fine-tuning the full model leads to the lowest error comparatively early in training, e.g. already after the first epoch on IMDb. The error then increases as the model starts to overfit and knowledge captured through pretraining is lost. In contrast, ULMFiT is more stable and suffers from no such catastrophic forgetting; performance remains similar or improves until late epochs, which shows the positive effect of the learning rate schedule."
"What does ""MT domains"" mean? ","Sure! Here's my answer:

The attention coefficient is a weighting factor that determines the importance of each feature in the input data",MT stands for Machine Translation.,"Hypercolumns In NLP, only recently have methods been proposed that go beyond transferring word embeddings. The prevailing approach is to pretrain embeddings that capture additional context via other tasks. Embeddings at different levels are then used as features, concatenated either with the word embeddings or with the inputs at intermediate layers. This method is known as hypercolumns (Hariharan et al., 2015) in CV2 and is used by Peters et al. (2017), Peters et al. (2018), Wieting and Gimpel (2017), Conneau et al. (2017), and McCann et al. (2017) who use language modeling, paraphrasing, entailment, and Machine Translation (MT) respectively for pretraining. Specifically, Peters et al. (2018) require engineered custom architectures, while we show state-of-the-art performance with the same basic architecture across a range of tasks. In CV, hypercolumns have been nearly entirely superseded by end-to-end fine-tuning (Long et al., 2015a)."
What metrics are used to compare the performance of ULMFiT against existing approaches?,"No, NASNets does not perform better than MobileNet and ShuffleNet under resource-constrained settings","For consistency, the authors reported all results as error rates where lower is better.","In order to assess the impact of each contribution, we perform a series of analyses and ablations. We run experiments on three corpora, IMDb, TREC-6, and AG that are representative of different tasks, genres, and sizes. For all experiments, we split off 10\% of the training set and report error rates on this validation set with unidirectional LMs. We fine-tune the classifier for 50 epochs and train all methods but ULMFiT with early stopping. Our contributions are the following: 1) We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), a method that can be used to achieve CV-like transfer learning for any task for NLP. 2) We propose discriminative fine-tuning, slanted triangular learning rates, and gradual unfreezing, novel techniques to retain previous knowledge and avoid catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. 3) We significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on six representative text classification datasets, with an error reduction of 18-24% on the majority of datasets. 4) We show that our method enables extremely sample-efficient transfer learning and perform an extensive ablation analysis. 5) We make the pretrained models and our code available to enable wider adoption. For consistency, we report all results as error rates (lower is better). We show the test error rates on the IMDb and TREC-6 datasets used by McCann et al. (2017) in Table 2. Our method outperforms both CoVe, a state-of-the-art transfer learning method based on hypercolumns, as well as the state-of-the-art on both datasets. On IMDb, we reduce the error dramatically by 43.9% and 22% with regard to CoVe and the state-of-the-art respectively. This is promising as the existing state-of-the-art requires complex architectures (Peters et al., 2018), multiple forms of attention (McCann et al., 2017) and sophisticated embedding schemes (Johnson and Zhang, 2016), while our method employs a regular LSTM with dropout. We note that the language model fine-tuning approach of Dai and Le (2015) only achieves an error of 7.64 vs. 4.6 for our method on IMDb, demonstrating the benefit of transferring knowledge from a large ImageNet-like corpus using our fine-tuning techniques. IMDb in particular is reflective of real world datasets: Its documents are generally a few paragraphs long—similar to emails (e.g for legal discovery) and online comments (e.g for community management); and sentiment analysis is similar to many commercial applications, e.g. product response tracking and support email routing."
Does the proposed approach in the paper require a labelled dataset?,The proposed LSTM Future Predictor Model can predict up to 100 future frames,"ULMFiT first pretrains a language model on a large general-domain corpus, and does not require any additional in-domain documents or labels for this. Then, the method will fine-tune the model on a target task using novel techniques. In fine-tuning, labelled examples and, if available, other task data are used.","One of the main benefits of transfer learning is being able to train a model for a task with a small number of labels. We evaluate ULMFiT on different numbers of labeled examples in two settings: only labeled examples are used for LM fine-tuning (‘supervised’); and all task data is available and can be used to fine-tune the LM (‘semi-supervised’). We compare ULMFiT to training from scratch—which is necessary for hypercolumn-based approaches. We split off balanced fractions of the training data, keep the validation set fixed, and use the same hyperparameters as before. We show the results in Figure 3. We propose Universal Language Model Finetuning (ULMFiT), which pretrains a language model (LM) on a large general-domain corpus and fine-tunes it on the target task using novel techniques. The method is universal in the sense that it meets these practical criteria: 1) It works across tasks varying in document size, number, and label type; 2) it uses a single architecture and training process; 3) it requires no custom feature engineering or preprocessing; and 4) it does not require additional in-domain documents or labels."
How well do the proposed model in this paper and the model in Dai and Lee (2015) generalize to documents of varying lengths?,"Sure! Here's the answer to the question based on the provided context:

Limited tuning and private training data","This work’s method was evaluated in six widely-studied datasets which varied in document length and experimental results demonstrated that the method outperformed existing approaches in all of these datasets. This indicates that this work’s method generalizes to documents of varying lengths.

IMDb in particular is reflective of real-world datasets: Its documents are generally a few paragraphs long—similar to emails (e.g for legal discovery) and online comments (e.g for community management); and sentiment analysis is similar to many commercial applications, e.g. product response tracking and support email routing. We propose a new method, Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) that addresses these issues and enables robust inductive transfer learning for any NLP task, akin to fine-tuning ImageNet models: The same 3-layer LSTM architecture—with the same hyperparameters and no additions other than tuned dropout hyperparameters—outperforms highly engineered models and transfer learning approaches on six widely studied text classification tasks. On IMDb, with 100 labeled examples, ULMFiT matches the performance of training from scratch with 10×10\times10 × and—given 50k unlabeled examples—with 100×100\times100 × more data."
Are batch normalisation and dropout used for the same reasons?,Distortion-editability tradeoff refers to the balance between preserving the original content of an image and allowing for significant manipulations through inversion,This work follows standard practices for CV classifiers by using batch normalization and dropout in each block. Dropout is used to reduce the risk of overfitting which can decrease performance. The reason for using batch normalization cannot be answered in this paper.,"Finally, for fine-tuning the classifier, we augment the pretrained language model with two additional linear blocks.Following standard practice for CV classifiers, each block uses batch normalization Ioffe and Szegedy (2015) and dropout, with ReLU activations for the intermediate layer and a softmax activation that outputs a probability distribution over target classes at the last layer. Note that the parameters in these task-specific classifier layers are the only ones that are learned from scratch. The first linear layer takes as the input the pooled last hidden layer states. In order to gauge the importance of choosing an appropriate LM, we compare a vanilla LM with the same hyperparameters without any dropout999To avoid overfitting, we only train the vanilla LM classifier for 5 epochs and keep dropout of 0.4 in the classifier. with the AWD-LSTM LM with tuned dropout parameters in Table 5. Using our fine-tuning techniques, even a regular LM reaches surprisingly good performance on the larger datasets. On the smaller TREC-6, a vanilla LM without dropout runs the risk of overfitting, which decreases performance."
What is the average number of words in a Wikipedia article from the Wikitext-103 dataset? ,Yes,"The Wikitext-103 dataset consists of 28,595 preprocessed Wikipedia articles and 103 million words. Therefore, the approximate average number of words per article in this dataset is 3,602.","An ImageNet-like corpus for language should be large and capture general properties of language. We pretrain the language model on Wikitext-103 Merity et al. (2017b) consisting of 28,595 preprocessed Wikipedia articles and 103 million words. Pretraining is most beneficial for tasks with small datasets and enables generalization even with 100 labeled examples. We leave the exploration of more diverse pretraining corpora to future work, but expect that they would boost performance. While this stage is the most expensive, it only needs to be performed once and improves performance and convergence of downstream models."
"Out of all the classification datasets used in the experiments of this paper, what is the ratio of number of samples in the largest to the smallest dataset?",Adaptive Group Normalization (AdaGN),The statistics for each dataset and task are found in Table  1. The ratio of the number of samples in the largest to smallest dataset could be calculated from these statistics.,"We evaluate our method on six widely-studied datasets, with varying numbers of documents and varying document length, used by state-of-the-art text classification and transfer learning approaches Johnson and Zhang (2017); McCann et al. (2017) as instances of three common text classification tasks: sentiment analysis, question classification, and topic classification. We show the statistics for each dataset and task in Table 1."
Why does the proposed model need advanced preprocessing and feature generation to function well?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

No.

Weak supervision is not a subset or type of regular supervised learning, as it involves using a small number of labeled examples to fine-tune a pre-trained language model, whereas regular supervised learning typically requires a larger amount of labeled data to train a model from scratch","The proposed model is universal meaning that it does not require custom feature engineering or preprocessing. For example, the pre-processing is taken from earlier work and only adds special tokens to capture relevant aspects for classification.","We use the same pre-processing as in earlier work Johnson and Zhang (2017); McCann et al. (2017). In addition, to allow the language model to capture aspects that might be relevant for classification, we add special tokens for upper-case words, elongation, and repetition. We propose Universal Language Model Finetuning (ULMFiT), which pretrains a language model (LM) on a large general-domain corpus and fine-tunes it on the target task using novel techniques. The method is universal in the sense that it meets these practical criteria: 1) It works across tasks varying in document size, number, and label type; 2) it uses a single architecture and training process; 3) it requires no custom feature engineering or preprocessing; and 4) it does not require additional in-domain documents or labels"
Do the authors perform hyperparameter tuning for each dataset independently?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

No","The authors did not perform hyperparameter tuning for each dataset. They used the same set of hyperparameters across tasks, and they tuned the parameters on the IMDb validation set.","We are interested in a model that performs robustly across a diverse set of tasks. To this end, if not mentioned otherwise, we use the same set of hyperparameters across tasks, which we tune on the IMDb validation set. We use the AWD-LSTM language model (Merity et al., 2017a) with an embedding size of 400, 3 layers, 1150 hidden activations per layer, and a BPTT batch size of 70. We apply dropout of 0.4 to layers, 0.3 to RNN layers, 0.4 to input embedding layers, 0.05 to embedding layers, and weight dropout of 0.5 to the RNN hidden-to-hidden matrix. The classifier has a hidden layer of size 50. We use Adam with β1 = 0.7 instead of the default β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.99, similar to (Dozat and Manning, 2017). We use a batch size of 64, a base learning rate of 0.004 and 0.01 for finetuning the LM and the classifier respectively, and tune the number of epochs on the validation set of each task7 . We otherwise use the same practices"
By how much does the proposed approach outperform CoVE?,"Facial recognition (FR) techniques can be broadly classified into traditional and deep learning-based methods. Traditional methods include local-feature-based FR, which uses handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and holistic approaches, which derive a low-dimensional representation of the face through certain distribution assumptions. These methods have been shown to be effective in controlled environments but struggle with uncontrolled facial changes, such as lighting, pose, expression, and disguise.

Deep learning-based methods, on the other hand, have shown promising results in addressing these challenges. These methods use neural networks to learn a robust representation of the face, which can be more effective in real-world applications. DeepFace, a 9-layer model trained on 4 million facial images, achieved SOTA accuracy on the LFW benchmark in 2014, and subsequent deep learning-based methods have further improved the accuracy to above 99.80% in just three years.

However, despite the progress made by deep learning-based methods, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as privacy concerns and the need for better understanding of the ""identity capacity"" of deep representations. Additionally, deep learning-based methods require large amounts of training data, which can be difficult to obtain in real-world applications.

In summary, traditional methods have been shown to be effective in controlled environments but struggle with uncontrolled facial changes, while deep learning-based methods have shown promising results in addressing these challenges but require large amounts of training data and raise privacy concerns","On IMDb, the proposed approach reduced the error by 43.9% when compared to CoVe but, on TREC-6, the approach did not improve performance significantly. The results are shown in Table 2.","For consistency, we report all results as error rates (lower is better). We show the test error rates on the IMDb and TREC-6 datasets used by McCann et al. (2017) in Table 2. Our method outperforms both CoVe, a state-of-the-art transfer learning method based on hypercolumns, as well as the state-of-the-art on both datasets. On IMDb, we reduce the error dramatically by 43.9% and 22% with regard to CoVe and the state-of-the-art respectively. This is promising as the existing state-of-the-art requires complex architectures Peters et al. (2018), multiple forms of attention McCann et al. (2017) and sophisticated embedding schemes Johnson and Zhang (2016), while our method employs a regular LSTM with dropout. We note that the language model fine-tuning approach of Dai and Le (2015) only achieves an error of 7.64 vs. 4.6 for our method on IMDb, demonstrating the benefit of transferring knowledge from a large ImageNet-like corpus using our fine-tuning techniques. IMDb in particular is reflective of real-world datasets: Its documents are generally a few paragraphs long—similar to emails (e.g for legal discovery) and online comments (e.g for community management); and sentiment analysis is similar to many commercial applications, e.g. product response tracking and support email routing. On TREC-6, our improvement—similar as the improvements of state-of-the-art approaches—is not statistically significant, due to the small size of the 500-examples test set.Nevertheless, the competitive performance on TREC-6 demonstrates that our model performs well across different dataset sizes and can deal with examples that range from single sentences—in the case of TREC-6—to several paragraphs for IMDb. Note that despite pretraining on more than two orders of magnitude less data than the 7 million sentence pairs used by McCann et al. (2017), we consistently outperform their approach on both datasets."
What does early stopping while training mean?,Pixel accuracy,"In this work, all the other methods but ULMFiT were trained with early stopping. The meaning of early stopping cannot be answered from this paper.","In order to assess the impact of each contribution, we perform a series of analyses and ablations. We run experiments on three corpora, IMDb, TREC6, and AG that are representative of different tasks, genres, and sizes. For all experiments, we split off 10% of the training set and report error rates on this validation set with unidirectional LMs. We fine-tune the classifier for 50 epochs and train all methods but ULMFiT with early stopping."
Are there any differences between AWD-LSTM and LSTMs in general?,MIDI sequencing refers to the process of creating a musical composition using MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) technology,"The language model AWD-LSTM is a regular LSTM with various tuned dropout hyperparameters, but with no attention, short-cut connections or other sophisticated additions. The particular difference between AWD-LSTM and LSTMs in general is not specified and cannot be answered from this paper.","In our experiments, we use the state-of-the-art language model AWD-LSTM Merity et al. (2017a), a regular LSTM (with no attention, short-cut connections, or other sophisticated additions) with various tuned dropout hyperparameters. Analogous to CV, we expect that downstream performance can be improved by using higher-performance language models in the future."
"If, for a certain model, it was theorized that the penultimate layer is the most important later for generating embeddings, how could discriminative fine-tuning be used to validate or refute that theory?","Yes, previous researches mentioned in the text have used GNNs. These include the papers by Gori et al. (2005), Scarselli et al. (2009), Li et al. (2015), Sukhbaatar et al. (2016), Bruna et al. (2013), Henaff et al. (2015), Defferrard et al. (2016), Kipf & Welling (2016), and Bronstein et al. (2017)","In this work, discriminative fine-tuning was used to fine-tune each layer with a different learning rate. Specifically, the learning rate was decreased going from the last layer to lower layers. The authors found that this improved performance across several datasets. This suggests that this result shows that the last layers are most important for classification as the technique assigned higher learning rates to them which also increased performance.","As different layers capture different types of information Yosinski et al. (2014), they should be fine-tuned to different extents.To this end, we propose a novel fine-tuning method, discriminative fine-tuning444An unrelated method of the same name exists for deep Boltzmann machines Salakhutdinov and Hinton (2009).. We compare no fine-tuning against fine-tuning the full model Erhan et al. (2010) (‘Full’), the most commonly used fine-tuning method, with and without discriminative fine-tuning (‘Discr’) and slanted triangular learning rates (‘Stlr’) in Table 6. Fine-tuning the LM is most beneficial for larger datasets. ‘Discr’ and ‘Stlr’ improve performance across all three datasets and are necessary on the smaller TREC-6, where regular fine-tuning is not beneficial. The SGD update with discriminative finetuning is then the following: θ l t = θ l t−1 − η l · ∇θ lJ(θ) (2) We empirically found it to work well to first choose the learning rate η L of the last layer by fine-tuning only the last layer and using η l−1 = η l/2.6 as the learning rate for lower layers."
"While the proposed approach uses Adam, would there be any systemic issues with using SGD or RMSProp with discriminative fine-tuning?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

YES, increasing anchor density does improve AP",Discriminative fine-tuning tunes each layer with different learning rates. The systemic issues that will occur from using SGD or RMSProp with discriminative fine-tuning cannot be answered from this paper.,"Instead of using the same learning rate for all layers of the model, discriminative fine-tuning allows us to tune each layer with different learning rates. For context, the regular stochastic gradient descent (SGD) update of a model’s parameters \theta at time step t looks like the following Ruder (2016):\theta_{t}=\theta_{t-1}-\eta\cdot\nabla_{\theta}J(\theta)(1)where \eta is the learning rate and \nabla_{\theta}J(\theta) is the gradient with regard to the model’s objective function. For discriminative fine-tuning, we split the parameters \theta into \{\theta^{1},\ldots,\theta^{L}\} where \theta^{l} contains the parameters of the model at the l-th layer and L is the number of layers of the model. Similarly, we obtain \{\eta^{1},\ldots,\eta^{L}\} where \eta^{l} is the learning rate of the l-th layer. The SGD update with discriminative fine-tuning is then the following:\theta_{t}^{l}=\theta_{t-1}^{l}-\eta^{l}\cdot\nabla_{\theta^{l}}J(\theta)(2)We empirically found it to work well to first choose the learning rate \eta^{L} of the last layer by fine-tuning only the last layer and using \eta^{l-1}=\eta^{l}/2.6 as the learning rate for lower layers."
"The paper mentions how training two models, one forward model and one backward model (to achieve bidirectionality) results in a performance gain. Is the performance gain proportional to the 2x increase in training cost?",4 encoders and 4 decoders,"Training a second model to ensemble a bidirectional model brings a performance boost of around 0.5 to 0.7 and, on IMDb, it lowers test error from 5.30 to 4.58. The increase in performance (or decrease of test error) is of around 15% which is not proportional to the 2x increase in training cost.","At the cost of training a second model, ensembling the predictions of a forward and backwards LM-classifier brings a performance boost of around 0.5–0.7. On IMDb we lower the test error from 5.30 of a single model to 4.58 for the bidirectional model."
"What theoretical backing, if any, exists to support the authors' numerical arguments around how their techniques minimze catastrophic forgetting?","The authors might have considered factors such as the complexity of the dataset, the size of the training set, and the desired level of accuracy when deciding on the number of layers and rectified units for their experiments on MNIST and speech recognition","Fine-tuning the full model leads to low error early in training, but then error increases as the model overfits and loses knowledge captured through pretraining. The authors refer to this as catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, ULMFiT is more stable as performance remains similar or improves even until later epochs. Thus, the authors argue that ULMFiT’s stable performance until later epochs is evidence that catastrophic forgetting is minimized.","On all datasets, fine-tuning the full model leads to the lowest error comparatively early in training, e.g. already after the first epoch on IMDb. The error then increases as the model starts to overfit and knowledge captured through pretraining is lost. In contrast, ULMFiT is more stable and suffers from no such catastrophic forgetting; performance remains similar or improves until late epochs, which shows the positive effect of the learning rate schedule"
"How would using max-pooling, min-pooling, or mean-pooling instead of the proposed concat-pooling impact memory utilisation during training? ",The baseline models were implemented from existing codes from the original authors,"Concat-pooling functions by concatenating the hidden state of the last time step of the document with both the max-pooled and mean-pooled representations of the hidden states. This pooling is done for as many time steps as fit in GPU memory. This means that concat-pooling utilises as much memory as there is available. The memory utilisation of using max-pooling, min-pooling, or mean-pooling cannot be answered from this paper.","The signal in text classification tasks is often contained in a few words, which may occur anywhere in the document. As input documents can consist of hundreds of words, information may get lost if we only consider the last hidden state of the model. For this reason, we concatenate the hidden state at the last time step \mathbf{h}_{T} of the document with both the max-pooled and the mean-pooled representation of the hidden states over as many time steps as fit in GPU memory \mathbf{H}=\{\mathbf{h}_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{h}_{T}\}:\mathbf{h}_{c}=[\mathbf{h}_{T},\mathtt{maxpool}(\mathbf{H}),\mathtt{meanpool}(\mathbf{H})](4)where [] is concatenation."
What is back propogation through time?,CRR and Decision Transformer,"Backpropagation through time (BPTT) is used to train language models to enable gradient propagation for large input sequences. This work proposes BPTT for text classification (BPT3C) where a document is first divided into fixed-length batches. At the beginning of each batch, the model is initialized with the final state of the previous batch and gradients are back-propagated to the batches whose hidden states contributed to the final prediction. Whether the process in BPT3C is the same as the process in BPTT cannot be answered from this paper.","Language models are trained with backpropagation through time (BPTT) to enable gradient propagation for large input sequences. In order to make fine-tuning a classifier for large documents feasible, we propose BPTT for Text Classification (BPT3C): We divide the document into fixed-length batches of size b. At the beginning of each batch, the model is initialized with the final state of the previous batch; we keep track of the hidden states for mean and max-pooling; gradients are back-propagated to the batches whose hidden states contributed to the final prediction. In practice, we use variable length backpropagation sequences Merity et al. (2017a)."
"Why do the authors claim that their proposed model is ""sample efficient""? ","ELMO is an LSTM-based model, while BERT and DeBERTa are based on transformer architecture","The authors claim that their proposed method enables sample-efficient transfer learning through experiments where they showed that, with only 100 labelled examples, ULMFiT could match the performance of training from scratch with 10 to 20 times more data.","We propose a new method, Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) that addresses these issues and enables robust inductive transfer learning for any NLP task, akin to fine-tuning ImageNet models: The same 3-layer LSTM architecture—with the same hyperparameters and no additions other than tuned dropout hyperparameters—outperforms highly engineered models and transfer learning approaches on six widely studied text classification tasks. On IMDb, with 100 labeled examples, ULMFiT matches the performance of training from scratch with 10×10\times10 × and—given 50k unlabeled examples—with 100×100\times100 × more data. Our contributions are the following: 1) We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), a method that can be used to achieve CV-like transfer learning for any task for NLP. 2) We propose discriminative fine-tuning, slanted triangular learning rates, and gradual unfreezing, novel techniques to retain previous knowledge and avoid catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. 3) We significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on six representative text classification datasets, with an error reduction of 18-24% on the majority of datasets. 4) We show that our method enables extremely sample-efficient transfer learning and perform an extensive ablation analysis. 5) We make the pretrained models and our code available to enable wider adoption. On IMDb and AG, supervised ULMFiT with only 100 labeled examples matches the performance of training from scratch with 10× and 20× more data respectively, clearly demonstrating the benefit of general-domain LM pretraining. If we allow ULMFiT to also utilize unlabeled examples (50k for IMDb, 100k for AG), at 100 labeled examples, we match the performance of training from scratch with 50× and 100× more data on AG and IMDb respectively. On TREC-6, ULMFiT significantly improves upon training from scratch; as examples are shorter and fewer, supervised and semi-supervised ULMFiT achieve similar results."
Is weak supervision a subset or type of regular supervised learning?,To enable non-linear transformation of the input data,"In this work, fine-tuning an LM only on labeled examples is considered to be supervised learning. The general definitions of supervised learning and weak supervision, and whether weak supervision is a subset of regular supervised learning cannot be answered in this paper.","One of the main benefits of transfer learning is being able to train a model for a task with a small number of labels. We evaluate ULMFiT on different numbers of labeled examples in two settings: only labeled examples are used for LM fine-tuning (‘supervised’); and all task data is available and can be used to fine-tune the LM (‘semi-supervised’). We compare ULMFiT to training from scratch—which is necessary for hypercolumn-based approaches. We split off balanced fractions of the training data, keep the validation set fixed, and use the same hyperparameters as before. We show the results in Figure 3."
Do the authors use gradient accumulation while training the model?,"BUIR requires only positive interactions for training, eliminating the need for negative sampling",This work uses Backpropagation Through Time for Text Classification (BPT3C) where a document is divided into fixed-length batches and the gradients are back-propagated to batches.

However, even for large datasets, pretraining improves performance."
"In language models, which method would be better for preventing overfitting from batch normalization and dropout?","NO.

Smaller models with equivalent accuracy as AlexNet can be deployed using over-the-air updates in Tesla without compromising safety. The advantages of smaller models, such as more efficient distributed training, less overhead when exporting new models to clients, and feasible FPGA and embedded deployment, outweigh any potential accuracy trade-offs","According to this work, without dropout, a vanilla LM can run the risk of overfitting, which decreases performance. The effect that batch normalization has on preventing overfitting and, then, whether it is more effective than dropout cannot be answered in this paper.","In order to gauge the importance of choosing an appropriate LM, we compare a vanilla LM with the same hyperparameters without any dropout999To avoid overfitting, we only train the vanilla LM classifier for 5 epochs and keep dropout of 0.4 in the classifier. with the AWD-LSTM LM with tuned dropout parameters in Table 5.

Are (1) slanted triangular learning rate and (2) linear warmup followed by linear decay the same thing?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

By standardizing the interview process and reducing human bias, the proposed model increases the reliability of the assessment","Slanted triangular learning rate (SLTR) involves first linearly increasing the learning rate and then linearly decaying it according to a given update schedule. It modifies triangular learning rates by using a short increase and long decay period. The function of linear warmup and linear decay cannot be found in this paper. Thus, the difference between SLTR and these cannot be answered in this paper.","For adapting its parameters to task-specific features, we would like the model to quickly converge to a suitable region of the parameter space in the beginning of training and then refine its parameters. Using the same learning rate (LR) or an annealed learning rate throughout training is not the best way to achieve this behaviour.Instead, we propose slanted triangular learning rates (STLR), which first linearly increases the learning rate and then linearly decays it according to the following update schedule, which can be seen in Figure 2:\begin{split}cut&=\lfloor T\cdot cut\_frac\rfloor\\p&=\begin{cases}t/cut,&\text{if}\ t<cut\\1-\frac{t-cut}{cut\cdot(1/cut\_frac-1)},&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\\\eta_{t}&=\eta_{max}\cdot\frac{1+p\cdot(ratio-1)}{ratio}\end{split}(3)where T is the number of training iterations555In other words, the number of epochs times the number of updates per epoch., cut\_frac is the fraction of iterations we increase the LR, cut is the iteration when we switch from increasing to decreasing the LR, p is the fraction of the number of iterations we have increased or will decrease the LR respectively, ratio specifies how much smaller the lowest LR is from the maximum LR \eta_{max}, and \eta_{t} is the learning rate at iteration t. We generally use cut\_frac=0.1, ratio=32 and \eta_{max}=0.01. STLR modifies triangular learning rates Smith (2017) with a short increase and a long decay period, which we found key for good performance.666We also credit personal communication with the author. In Section 5, we compare against aggressive cosine annealing, a similar schedule that has recently been used to achieve state-of-the-art performance in CV Loshchilov and Hutter (2017).777While Loshchilov and Hutter (2017) use multiple annealing cycles, we generally found one cycle to work best."
What are some other approaches for semantic similarity and how do they differ to Sentence Transformers in architecture and performance?,Displaying images from the training or test set that cause high or low activations for individual units,"The authors mention that they experiment with using a sentence transformer (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) and a custom Seq2Seq model called GUD-IR for their retrieval function. The paper does not contain any information on any other models (apart from these two) that could be used for semantic similarity.","A retrieved past feedback that is incorrect might cause the model to make a mistake, thus necessitating a good retrieval function. We propose a two-stage method for effective retrieval involving: transforming \mathbf{x}, followed by a similarity lookup of the transformed \mathbf{x} in \mathcal{M}. When the task involves high surface-level similarity among past feedback, such as in lexical word tasks, then a simple heuristic-based transformation is sufficient.However, such simple transformations are insufficient for tasks that involves more complex retrieval e.g., when two lexically dissimilar situations can share the same understanding.For example, consider two situations from ert-nl: Filling a false time sheet at work and Being at a party, and telling parents I am studying.These situations look lexically dissimilar but correspond to the same underlying social principle lying to authority.In our experiments, off-the-shelf methods failed to address these challenges (see §4 later). After the transformation stage, the closest matching entry is then used as the corresponding \mathbf{fb}. Transformation reduces \mathcal{M}(\mathbf{x}) to a search over \mathbf{fb}_{1},\mathbf{fb}_{2},\ldots,\mathbf{fb}_{|\mathcal{M}|} with \hat{\mathbf{fb}} as the search query. We compute similarity based on a fine-tuned Sentence transformers (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). To address these challenges with transformation in complex tasks, we have designed a novel SEQ 2 SEQ based transformation called GUD - IR. Given x, GUD - IR generates a transformed feedback fb for x using a generative SEQ 2 SEQ model. Our approach is inspired and supported by the recent success of generate and retrieve (Mao et al., 2021) methods. However, despite the similarity, the methods have different goals: Mao et al. (2021) leverage generative models for query expansion, whereas our goal is explainable input understanding. See Appendix B for more details on GUD - IR."
How accurate or correct was their few-shot approach to making GPT-3 verbalize its understanding?,The author uses the k-hop neighborhood of each node to extract the subgraph of each node,"The authors mention in multiple places how their iterative correction/feedback process depends on GPT verbalizing it's thinking process or understanding of the user's inputs or needs. They explain how they encourage this sort of behaviour through modifying the prompt, but this paper does not seem to quantifiably measure how ""accurate"" this verbalization would be.","We operationalize this idea by including task verbalization in the prompt (Fig. 3).Given a question What sounds like < sighted > ?, a vanilla prompting approach will generate the answer cited.In contrast, we include a \mathbf{u} the homophone for in the prompt.gpt-3 is adept at reasoning with just a handful of examples, and thus can be expected to mimic the prompt to generate task understanding and answer.gpt-3 generates such additional information in all our tasks.Given a test question What sounds similar to < sighted > ?, if the model generates the word that has the same meaning as \mathbf{u}, the user has a reason to believe that the answer is wrong. Figure 1 presents a sample interaction between a user and gpt-3 that our setup enables.The model was asked for a similar word. However, the model’s (incorrect) task understanding \mathbf{u} was “The homophone of good is”.The user can detect such discrepancy between the intended and interpreted task instruction, and can provide feedback \mathbf{fb} as ""similar to means with a similar meaning"", clarifying that they actually wanted a synonym.Crucially, note that such instructional correction is feasible even if the user does not knowthe correct answer to their question, as they are critiquing the model’s understanding of theirintent, rather than the answers themselves.Thus, our setup does not require the users to be experts at tasks being solved, another advantage of our approach. We present \ours, a novel, memory-enhanced gpt-3 that allows users to interact and improve the model without retraining. A key insight is to have the model articulate not just its answer but also its understanding of the user’s intent, providing an avenue for feedback.We show that deployed systems with fixed large-language models can still be improved by interacting with end-users, potentially improving their performance and broadening their utility. In Tandon et al. (2022), we show that using a memory of user feedback can be used to repair erroneous model in a supervised setting.In this work, we build upon the recent advances in few-shot prompting to modify gpt-3’s behavior by adding user feedback to the query (prompt).Like others, we use gpt-3 with few-shot prompting, where the prompt consistsof a prefix prefix containing a few input-output “training” examples of the task, followed by the input x, e.g., a question,to operate on. However, while prior work has focused on constructing better prefixes, e.g., dynamically selecting good “training” examplesbased on the question Le Scao and Rush (2021); Liu et al. (2021a), or even representing the prefix latently Li and Liang (2021),our work elaborates the input x itself to clarify the intended task, by adding user feedback fb from previous misunderstandings."
"Instead of editing the prompt based on previous cases, did they test a simpler approach where previous cases are concatenated to the prompt?","Yes, the authors were able to draw a conclusive impact of CNN architectural choices on model size and accuracy through their experiments and analysis","Yes, they did. This is the GROW-PROMPT baseline mentioned in the paper - they add the latest few samples in memory to the prompt.","We compare \ours(memory-assisted prompt editing) with two baselines:\bulletno-mem This is the standard gpt-3 444We use gpt-3-175b (davinci) for all experiments. in few-shot prompting mode (hyper-parameters listed in Appendix §C). Input is \mathbf{p}\ \#\ \mathbf{x}_{i} (i.e., question \mathbf{x}_{i} appended to prompt \mathbf{p}).It generates answer \mathbf{y}_{i} and its understanding of the user’s intent \mathbf{u}_{i}.\bulletgrow-prompt: Similar to no-mem, but the \mathbf{p} is continuously grown with a subset of memory \mathcal{M} that can fit within the prompt (max. 2048 tokens).The most recent subset of \mathcal{M} of memory inserted is inserted in the prompt.The ethical reasoning tasks (ert) involve long examples, and the initial prompt itself takes close to the max allowed tokens.Thus, the grow-prompt setup is only provided for the lexical relations and word scrambling tasks."
Why does the approach need a gating mechanism when a good retrieval should be able to correctly filter out irrelevant feedback from the memory?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

No.

Using more epochs during training does not necessarily increase the validation accuracy. In fact, overfitting can occur if the model is trained for too many epochs, which can negatively impact the validation accuracy. In this case, the optimal hyperparameters were already identified through grid search, and further increasing the number of epochs may not improve the model's performance","A gating function is needed precisely because the retrieval function might not be able to filter out irrelevant feedback from memory. This is a challenging thing to implement since syntactically or lexically similar things might or might not refer to similar concepts. Another challenge is with adversarial feedback, made by users intending to mess with the system. It is true that a gating function in the combiner would not be required if the retrieval function was near perfect at eliminating irrelevant feedback. Regardless, some form of filtering has to be done at some stage - whether it's in the lookup/retrieval function or in the combiner function does not specifically matter, but the existence of a filtering mechanism is crucial for MemPrompt-like systems to work.",": A gating function allowing irrelevant, retrieved feedback to be ignored. A retrieved past feedback that is incorrect might cause the model to make a mistake, thus necessitating a good retrieval function. We propose a two-stage method for effective retrieval involving: transforming \mathbf{x}, followed by a similarity lookup of the transformed \mathbf{x} in \mathcal{M}. When the task involves high surface-level similarity among past feedback, such as in lexical word tasks, then a simple heuristic-based transformation is sufficient.However, such simple transformations are insufficient for tasks that involves more complex retrieval e.g., when two lexically dissimilar situations can share the same understanding.For example, consider two situations from ert-nl: Filling a false time sheet at work and Being at a party, and telling parents I am studying.These situations look lexically dissimilar but correspond to the same underlying social principle lying to authority.In our experiments, off-the-shelf methods failed to address these challenges (see §4 later). Extending the discussion on noise in feedback, our setting assumes that users will not provide any adversarial feedback. However, in real-world environments, this assumption is unlikely to hold. Additionally, there is a risk in the real-world deployment of our system, wherein an adversarial user might provide harmful feedback, thus maliciously controlling the systems (potentially a home-based robot) where our method is deployed. Thus, robust mechanisms such as gud-ir and memory adapters will be critical for successful real-world deployments."
"What are a couple of examples of ""lexical QA tasks""?","Using relative encoding compared to absolute encoding can provide several advantages, such as:

* Incorporating positional information into the self-attention mechanism, allowing the model to capture relative relationships between nodes on the graph.
* Distinguishing between true and created edges, as in the case of SAN (Kreuzer et al., 2021).
* Allowing for the incorporation of structural information into the graph Transformer, as in the case of centrality measures and shortest path distances (Ying et al., 2021).

These advantages can lead to improved performance on graph-related tasks, as relative encoding can provide a more nuanced understanding of the graph structure and node relationships","The five kinds of lexical question-and-answer tasks that the authors mention are: synonyms, antonyms, homophones, definitions and sentence usage generation. An example of a synonym task could be ""what is a word that has the same meaning as encumbrance"".","We apply our approach to four tasks: (1) lexical relations (e.g., antonyms, Figure 1),(2) word scrambling (e.g., anagrams), (3) ethics (with user feedback being the appropriate class of ethicalconsideration), and (4) ethics (with user feedback being natural language).For all five tasks, the dataset consists of (\mathbf{x},\mathbf{fb}\rightarrow\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y}) tuples, where \mathbf{fb} clarifies the task in \mathbf{x}.We have a simulated conversational setting, in which a user can ask the model \mathbf{x} (covering any of these five tasks). If the model gives a wrong answer to query \mathbf{x}, then \mathbf{fb} is used as the simulated corrective feedback.The sources for these datasets are listed in Appendix  §E. The lexical relation task is to predict a word with a given lexical relationship to an input word.We use five relationships: synonym (syn), antonym (ant), homophone (hom), definition (defn), and sentence usage generation (sent)."
Why does the approach not simply add all feedback examples in memory to the prompt if they will be adding examples anyways?,a neural network,"The proposed approach (MemPrompt) probably does not add all feedback examples in memory to the prompt since the size of the prompt is limited to 2048 tokens. Additionally, increasing the size of the prompt leads to higher cost (in terms of compute resources required to process the query).","Figure 8 reports the overall performance on the word reasoning tasks.The accuracy improves substantially within 300 examples when using memory (in yellow) vs. no memory (in blue).Note that we are operating in a few-shot prompting regime (i.e., there is no training data over which we train).The performance of grow-prompt (red) lies in between, showing that non-selective memory is partially helpful, although not as effective as failure-driven retrieval (our model).However, grow-prompt is \sim 3x more expensive (larger prompts) and cannot scale beyond the 2048 tokens limit.We also found that the retrieved feedback from memory was effective 97% of the time; only in \approx 3% of cases feedback had no positive effect."
"What if, instead of concatenating the feedback to the prompt, the prompt was automatically edited according to the feedback?",Omniglot is a dataset of characters from 50 different alphabets,"Strictly speaking, the proposed approach is editing the prompt - even additions or concatenations to a user prompt also count as ""editing"" the prompt. However, the current paper contains no information on what would happen if the prompt were somehow edited without concatenation.","Our approach, \ours, pairs gpt-3 with a growing memory of cases where the model misunderstood user’s intent and was provided with corrective feedback.This feedback is question dependent, and thus the prompt for each sample is edited to adapt to the input.In this sense, our work can be seen as an instance of prompt engineering Liu et al. (2021b) which involves editing the prompts. Our work adds interactivity to prompt engineering as it involves dynamically updating the prompt for every instance. Once the feedback is received from the user, can the model successfully utilize it? By adding a few examples of the form \mathbf{x},\mathbf{fb}\rightarrow\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y} in the prompt and setting \mathbf{fb}=\mathbf{u}, we force the model to use the task understanding present in the input when generating the output (Figure 4).Recently, it has been shown that such repetition plays a crucial role in the success of few-shot prompting models (Madaan and Yazdanbakhsh, 2022). Recent work such as Liu et al. (2021a) investigate using dynamic prompts for better generation. For a given input \mathbf{x}, their method( kate) relies on retrieving examples from the training set that are similar to \mathbf{x} for dynamically creating the prompt \mathbf{p}. Note that our method edits \mathbf{x} with a feedback \mathbf{fb}, and is thus complementary to kate.We verify this by experiments on ert-cat and ert-nl. Specifically, we create dynamic prompts using kate, whereas \oursis used like before to attach a \mathbf{fb} to the question. We observe a consistent 10% improvement by using kate across all baselines, showing that the improvements are complementary. In Tandon et al.

How did they edit the prompt based on previous examples? Was it by editing the original text of the prompt or simply by concatenating the examples?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

The generator may not preserve the content of the input image","They seem to be including memory in prompts by adding the natural language feedback (fb) that users provide on a prompt (x) and it's response (u) by including the tuple (x, u, fb) in a structured format. It does seem like they are merely concatenating multiple of these tuples and adding them to the prompt, but the exact format of the prompt itself is not fully explained in the paper.","In our setup, given an input \mathbf{x}, a model generates an output \mathbf{y} and a sentence \mathbf{u} expressing its understanding of the task, a skill learned through few-shot examples in theprompt (Appendix D).The user can then critique \mathbf{u} by providing natural language feedback \mathbf{fb}. This is feasible even if the user does not know the correctness of \mathbf{y} because they are critiquing the model’s understanding of their intent rather the answers themselves.  As mentioned, given an input \mathbf{x}, we prompt the model to generate an output \mathbf{y} and a sentence \mathbf{u} expressing its understanding of the task.Thus, the in-context examples for \oursare of the form \mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y}.In addition to the input \mathbf{x}, \oursretrieves a \mathbf{fb} if a question similar to \mathbf{x} has been asked before.To enable the model to react to such feedback, we also include examples of the form (\mathbf{x},\mathbf{fb}\rightarrow\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y}) in the prompt, which are aimed to teach the model to react to \mathbf{fb} (Appendix D). Our approach, \ours, pairs gpt-3 with a growing memory of cases where the model misunderstood user’s intent and was provided with corrective feedback.This feedback is question dependent, and thus the prompt for each sample is edited to adapt to the input.In this sense, our work can be seen as an instance of prompt engineering Liu et al.

Further, it is desirable to have a system that can leverage past feedback on new, unseen examples for prompt-editing. We maintain a memory \mathcal{M} of such feedback as a set of key-value pairs, where thekey is a misunderstood question, and the value is the user’s feedback to correct that misunderstanding. Given a new question, we check if the model has made a mistakeon a similar question earlier, by querying the memory for a similar question. If found,append the corresponding feedback to the question prompt. This mechanism aims toprevent the model from making the same type of mistake twice. This failure-driven remindingmechanism draws inspiration from the theory of recursive reminding in psychology Jacoby and Wahlheim (2013),which suggests humans index error corrections in the context in which those errors occurred.

Is this work focused only on solving cases where GPT-3 misunderstands the users' intents?,"Model compression approaches include SVD-based compression, Network Pruning, quantization, and huffman encoding","Yes, this work is primarily focused on solving cases when GPT-3 misunderstands user input. The authors' do discuss one specialized use case, on how memory assisted models such as these could be used to personalize models, but even this use-case could be seen as a subset of the broader use-case of users correcting a model's misunderstanding.","Finally, our work is a simple example of debugging and learning via dialog. While system debugging through dialogue has been explored in many contexts (Hixon et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Davis, 1977), our contribution is a dialogue about the model’s understanding of the user’s intent. Our approach, \ours, pairs gpt-3 with a growing memory of cases where the model misunderstood user’s intent and was provided with corrective feedback.This feedback is question dependent, and thus the prompt for each sample is edited to adapt to the input.In this sense, our work can be seen as an instance of prompt engineering Liu et al. (2021b) which involves editing the prompts. Our work adds interactivity to prompt engineering as it involves dynamically updating the prompt for every instance. Figure 1 presents a sample interaction between a user and gpt-3 that our setup enables.The model was asked for a similar word. However, the model’s (incorrect) task understanding \mathbf{u} was “The homophone of good is”.The user can detect such discrepancy between the intended and interpreted task instruction, and can provide feedback \mathbf{fb} as ""similar to means with a similar meaning"", clarifying that they actually wanted a synonym.Crucially, note that such instructional correction is feasible even if the user does not knowthe correct answer to their question, as they are critiquing the model’s understanding of theirintent, rather than the answers themselves.Thus, our setup does not require the users to be experts at tasks being solved, another advantage of our approach. This paper sets out the general architecture and a simple implementation of its components.We then demonstrate the system on four tasks, using simulated user feedback:(1) lexical relations (e.g., antonyms, Figure 1),(2) word scrambling (e.g., anagrams), (3) ethics (with user feedback being the appropriate class of ethicalconsideration, e.g., “it is about cheating”, using a small set of categories), and (4) ethics (with user feedback beingnatural language). We find that in all cases, gpt-3’s accuracy significantly increases with time, without retraining,as our approach enables it to use corrective feedback from earlier examples to avoid similar misunderstandings on future examples. In summary, our contributions are:\bulletWe show that a large model like gpt-3 can be improved after deployment, without retraining, through a memory-assisted architecture.\bulletOur implementation, \ours, is the first demonstration that this is possible - this is an important step forward for real use of LMs, and the paper sets out a general architecture that others can build on, a specific implementation, and detailed evaluation on multiple tasks. We demonstrate an application of \oursfor personalization with a use-case where user language preferences can be folded in the memory. We simulate a user who does not speak fluent English and uses code-mixed language. The queries posed by the user contain words from two Indian languages: Hindi and Punjabi. gpt-3 predictably misunderstands the task. The user clarifies the meanings of their dialect/language phrases. While initial queries fail, subsequent queries that reuse similar words succeed because their clarifications are present in the memory (details in Appendix §G). We present \ours, a novel, memory-enhanced gpt-3 that allows users to interact and improve the model without retraining. A key insight is to have the model articulate not just its answer but also its understanding of the user’s intent, providing an avenue for feedback.We show that deployed systems with fixed large-language models can still be improved by interacting with end-users, potentially improving their performance and broadening their utility. In Tandon et al. (2022), we show that using a memory of user feedback can be used to repair erroneous model in a supervised setting.In this work, we build upon the recent advances in few-shot prompting to modify gpt-3’s behavior by adding user feedback to the query (prompt).Like others, we use gpt-3 with few-shot prompting, where the prompt consistsof a prefix prefix containing a few input-output “training” examples of the task, followed by the input x, e.g., a question,to operate on.

"With ""memory of cases"" here, do they simply mean a prompt that contains all of these cases as examples?",The SSD training objective uses a weighted sum of localization loss (L_{loc}) and confidence loss (L_{conf}),"Yes, ""memory of cases"" in this context does mean a prompt with all of these relevant cases as examples listed out. However, the MemPrompt model's input size is limited to 2048-tokens, so adding all possible matches to the prompt would not be possible, which is why the authors' proposed approach specifically focuses on selecting which prompts to include.","As mentioned, given an input \mathbf{x}, we prompt the model to generate an output \mathbf{y} and a sentence \mathbf{u} expressing its understanding of the task.Thus, the in-context examples for \oursare of the form \mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y}.In addition to the input \mathbf{x}, \oursretrieves a \mathbf{fb} if a question similar to \mathbf{x} has been asked before.To enable the model to react to such feedback, we also include examples of the form (\mathbf{x},\mathbf{fb}\rightarrow\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y}) in the prompt, which are aimed to teach the model to react to \mathbf{fb} (Appendix D).

Therefore, if the context “c” has incorrect information, the model is likely to answer based on the factually incorrect information itself.

What weaknesses would a dataset that without entity replacement or anonymization have when training a reading comprehension model? Why is this a necessary step in the process?,SAE stands for Sparse Autoencoder,"Since the authors are attempting to build a reading comprehension model, not anonymizing the entities before using the dataset might lead to a situation where models use external information, or statistics on the distribution/frequency of words themselves to guess answers. These steps are needed to ensure that models use the context to answer the questions.","To prevent such degenerate solutions and create a focused task we anonymise andrandomise our corpora with the following procedure,a) use a coreference system to establish coreferents in eachdata point;b) replace all entities with abstract entity markers according tocoreference;c) randomly permute these entity markers whenever a data point is loaded. Compare the original and anonymised version of the example in Table3. Clearly a human reader can answer both queries correctly.However in the anonymised setup the context document is required for answeringthe query, whereas the original version could also be answered by someone withthe requisite background knowledge.Therefore, following this procedure, the only remaining strategy for answeringquestions is to do so by exploiting the context presented with each question.Thus performance on our two corpora truly measures reading comprehensioncapability. Naturally a production system would benefit from using allavailable information sources, such as clues through language and co-occurrencestatistics."
"What is the main difference between the ""maximum frequency"" and ""exclusive frequency"" baselines? ","The hole algorithm, also known as the ""à trous"" trick, is a technique used to compensate for the reduced stride in the convolutional layers of a neural network, specifically in the conv5 stage, by adding additional filters to fill in the ""holes"" created by the reduced stride","The main difference between the “maximum frequency” and “exclusive frequency” baselines is that the latter eliminates all entities found in the query as potential answers. The maximum frequency baseline merely returns the most commonly seen entity in the context as the answer - the exclusive benchmark does the same, but returns the most commonly seen entity in context which is not in the query.","So far we have motivated the need for better datasets and tasks to evaluate thecapabilities of machine reading models. We proceed by describing a number ofbaselines, benchmarks and new models to evaluate against this paradigm. Wedefine two simple baselines, the majority baseline (maximum frequency)picks the entity most frequently observed in the context document, whereas theexclusive majority (exclusive frequency) chooses the entity mostfrequently observed in the context but not observed in the query. The ideabehind this exclusion is that the placeholder is unlikely to be mentioned twicein a single Cloze form query."
All the models proposed in this paper are sequence-to-sequence models. True or False?,"The hard attention model is non-differentiable because it selects one patch of the image to attend to at a time, which makes the model non-differentiable at the patch-level","The authors seem to be using LSTM models for performing their analysis and experiments. However, the term “sequence-to-sequence” models is not defined in this paper, so answering True or False for this question is not possible based on the contents of this paper alone.","Long short-term memory (LSTM, [18]) networks haverecently seen considerable success in tasks such as machine translation andlanguage modelling [17]. When used for translation, DeepLSTMs [19] have shown a remarkable ability to embed longsequences into a vector representation which contains enough information togenerate a full translation in another language. Our first neural model forreading comprehension tests the ability of Deep LSTM encoders to handlesignificantly longer sequences. We feed our documents one word at a time intoa Deep LSTM encoder, after a delimiter we then also feed the query into theencoder. Alternatively we also experiment with processing the query then thedocument. The result is that this model processes each document query pair as asingle long sequence. Given the embedded document and query the networkpredicts which token in the document answers the query. Within the group of neural models explored here, the results paint a clearpicture with the Impatient and the Attentive Readers outperforming all othermodels. This is consistent with our hypothesis that attention is a keyingredient for machine reading and question answering due to the need topropagate information over long distances. The Deep LSTM Readerperforms surprisingly well, once again demonstrating that this simple sequentialarchitecture can do a reasonable job of learning to abstract long sequences,even when they are up to two thousand tokens in length. However this model doesfail to match the performance of the attention based models, even though theseonly use single layer LSTMs.666Memory constraints prevented us fromexperimenting with deeper Attentive Readers."
What is the main mathematical difference between the attentive LSTM reader and the vanilla Deep LSTM?,The cost function of the depthwise convolution is D_{K}\cdot D_{K}\cdot\alpha M\cdot D_{F}\cdot D_{F},The main difference between the attention-based LSTM and the vanilla one is that the former addresses the limitation of vanilla LSTM’s fixed and limited context size by taking into account the entire context of every token via a token-level attention mechanism.,"The Attentive Reader can be viewed as a generalisation of the application ofMemory Networks to question answering [3]. That model employsan attention mechanism at the sentence level where each sentence is representedby a bag of embeddings. The Attentive Reader employs a finer grained tokenlevel attention mechanism where the tokens are embedded given their entirefuture and past context in the input document. We can visualise the attention mechanism as a heatmap over a context document togain further insight into the models’ performance. The highlighted words showwhich tokens in the document were attended to by the model. In addition we mustalso take into account that the vectors at each token integrate long rangecontextual information via the bidirectional LSTM encoders.Figure 3 depicts heat maps for two queries that were correctlyanswered by the Attentive Reader.777Note that these examples were chosenas they were short, the average CNN validation document contained 763 tokens and27 entities, thus most instances were significantly harder to answer than theseexamples. In both cases confidently arriving at the correct answer requires themodel to perform both significant lexical generalsiation, e.g. ‘killed’\rightarrow ‘deceased’, and co-reference or anaphora resolution, e.g. ‘ent119 was killed’ \rightarrow ‘he was identified.’ However it is alsoclear that the model is able to integrate these signals with rough heuristicindicators such as the proximity of query words to the candidate answer."
"Assuming the authors performed a brute force hyperparameter search on all permutations of the five hyperparameters - hidden layer sizes, depths, LR, batch size and dropout - how many total experiments would they have had to perform?","Localization errors refer to the inaccuracies in the bounding box coordinates of detected objects, where the object is placed in the wrong location or the size of the bounding box is incorrect","For Deep LSTM readers 3 values of hidden layer sizes, 3 values of depths, 3 starting LRs, 2 batch sizes and 3 dropout fractions are considered.

Similarly for attention models, they experimented with 3 hidden layer sizes, 4 possible learning rates, 3 batch sizes and 4 values of dropout (3*4*3*4) = 144 possible configurations. Thus, if the authors performed a brute force hyperparameter search, they would have had to done 162 experiments for the vanilla Deep LSTM model and 144 experiments for the attention based model, or a total of 162 + 144 = 306 experiments.","All model hyperparameters were tuned on the respective validation sets of thetwo corpora.555For the Deep LSTM Reader, we consider hidden layer sizes{[64,128,\underline{256}]}, depths {[1,\underline{2},4]}, initiallearning rates {[1\text{\sc{e}}{-}3,5\text{\sc{e}}{-}4,\underline{1\text{\sc{e}}{-}4},5\text{\sc{e}}{-}5]}, batchsizes {[16,\underline{32}]} and dropout [0.0,\underline{0.1},0.2].

Is hyperparameter optimization performed independently for the two dataset corpora?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

A VAE is different from an autoencoder in that it has a probabilistic generative model, allowing it to learn a continuous and structured representation of the data, whereas an autoencoder only learns a reconstruction of the input data","Yes, it does appear that hyperparameter optimization for each dataset is performed independently.","All model hyperparameters were tuned on the respective validation sets of thetwo corpora.555For the Deep LSTM Reader, we consider hidden layer sizes{[64,128,\underline{256}]}, depths {[1,\underline{2},4]}, initiallearning rates {[1\text{\sc{e}}{-}3,5\text{\sc{e}}{-}4,\underline{1\text{\sc{e}}{-}4},5\text{\sc{e}}{-}5]}, batchsizes {[16,\underline{32}]} and dropout [0.0,\underline{0.1},0.2].

Do the authors claim that bigger datasets would improve the performance and expressiveness of reading comprehension models?,The underlying relationship is assumed to be a rendering of the same underlying scene,"Based on the information in this paper alone, it is unclear if a bigger dataset would improve the performance of reading comprehension models. While authors explain that a key contribution they make is the creation of a real-world, massive labelled reading comprehension dataset, it is unclear if such a dataset is essential to improve the performance of reading comprehension models - the authors pitch their dataset-building approach also as a way of evaluating performance of these models, which is different from the dataset itself leading to better performance.","While obtaining supervised natural language reading comprehension data hasproved difficult, some researchers have explored generating synthetic narrativesand queries [3, 4]. Such approaches allowthe generation of almost unlimited amounts of supervised data and enableresearchers to isolate the performance of their algorithms on individualsimulated phenomena. Work on such data has shown that neural network basedmodels hold promise for modelling reading comprehension, something that wewill build upon here. Historically, however, many similar approaches inComputational Linguistics have failed to manage the transition from syntheticdata to real environments, as such closed worlds inevitably fail tocapture the complexity, richness, and noise of natural language[5]. The supervised paradigm for training machine reading and comprehension modelsprovides a promising avenue for making progress on the path to building fullnatural language understanding systems. We have demonstrated a methodology forobtaining a large number of document-query-answer triples and shown thatrecurrent and attention based neural networks provide an effective modellingframework for this task.Our analysis indicates that the Attentive and Impatient Readers are able topropagate and integrate semantic information over long distances.

Therefore, this question cannot be answered in this paper and requires external knowledge.","For the representation of images, we use a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).

Could the authors have used a BiLSTM instead of an LSTM to improve the performance of their proposed model further?,"No, Google Street View Time Machine has not been previously used in another research. The authors propose to exploit this novel data source for the first time to create a dataset for place recognition","While the paper shows that LSTM has shown good performance on some sequence tasks, since there is no evidential information about BiLSTM in this paper this question cannot be answered in this paper. To answer the question, external knowledge about BiLSTM is required to compare how it would work compared to existing LSTM model.","It is natural to model p(S_{t}|I,S_{0},\ldots,S_{t-1}) with aRecurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the variable number ofwords we condition upon up to t-1 is expressed by a fixed lengthhidden state or memory h_{t}. This memory is updated after seeing anew input x_{t} by using a non-linear function f:h_{t+1}=f(h_{t},x_{t})\;.(3)To make the above RNN more concrete two crucial design choices are to be made: what isthe exact form of f and how are the images and words fed as inputs x_{t}. Forf we use a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) net, which has shown state-of-the artperformance on sequence tasks such as translation. This model is outlined in thenext section. The LSTM model is trained to predict each word of thesentence after it has seen the image as well as all preceding words as defined byp(S_{t}|I,S_{0},\ldots,S_{t-1}). For this purpose, it is instructive to thinkof the LSTM in unrolled form – a copy of the LSTM memory is created for theimage and each sentence word such that all LSTMs share the same parameters and theoutput m_{t-1} of the LSTM at time t-1 is fed to the LSTM at time t (seeFigure 3). All recurrent connections are transformed to feed-forward connections in theunrolled version. In more detail, if we denote by I the inputimage and by S=(S_{0},\ldots,S_{N}) a true sentence describing this image, theunrolling procedure reads:\displaystyle x_{-1}\displaystyle=\displaystyle\textrm{CNN}(I)(10)\displaystyle x_{t}\displaystyle=\displaystyle W_{e}S_{t},\quad t\in\{0\ldots N-1\}\quad(11)\displaystyle p_{t+1}\displaystyle=\displaystyle\textrm{LSTM}(x_{t}),\quad t\in\{0\ldots N-1\}\quad(12)where we represent each word as a one-hot vector S_{t} of dimension equal to thesize of the dictionary. Note that we denote by S_{0} a special start word and byS_{N} a special stop word which designates the start and end of the sentence.In particular by emitting the stop word the LSTM signals that a complete sentencehas been generated. Both the image and the words are mapped to the same space,the image by using a vision CNN, the words by using word embedding W_{e}. The imageI is only input once, at t=-1, to inform the LSTM about the image contents. Weempirically verified that feeding the image at each time step as an extra input yieldsinferior results, as the network can explicitly exploit noise in the image andoverfits more easily."

"Based on the authors' definition of the loss function used during training, will data points that contain longer sentences be likelier to have higher absolute value of loss and if so, why? ",The average attention sparsity is measured by calculating the average mask density across all attention heads,"Since the loss function is defined as a sum of the negative log likelihood and not averaged, the value tends to be increased in proportion to the length of S (N in eq.

"Can the architecture the authors' proposed be replaced with newer model architectures such as attention-based models or transformers, or is their task incompatible with these newer architectures?",Region of Interest,"Since the proposed method use RNN architecture for sequence modeling and not utilizing RNN-specific structures, other newer model like attention-based models or transformers also can be used instead of RNN.","In this work we combine deepconvolutional nets for image classification [12] withrecurrent networks for sequence modeling[10], to create a single networkthat generates descriptions of images. The RNN is trained in the context ofthis single “end-to-end” network. The model is inspiredby recent successes of sequence generation in machine translation[3, 2, 30], withthe difference that instead of starting with a sentence, we provide an imageprocessed by a convolutional net. The closest works are by Kiros et al. [15] whouse a neural net, but a feedforward one, to predict the next word given the imageand previous words. A recent work by Mao et al. [21] uses a recurrentNN for the same prediction task. This is very similar to the present proposal butthere are a number of important differences: we use a more powerful RNN model,and provide the visual input to the RNN model directly, which makes it possiblefor the RNN to keep track of the objects that have been explained by the text. Asa result of these seemingly insignificant differences, our system achievessubstantially better results on the established benchmarks. Lastly, Kiros et al. [14]propose to construct a joint multimodal embedding space by using a powerfulcomputer vision model and an LSTM that encodes text. In contrast to our approach,they use two separate pathways (one for images, one for text) to define a joint embedding,and, even though they can generate text, their approach is highly tuned for ranking."
"Based on the statement that the authors used a beam size of 20 during inference, how many total sentences would be generated till timestep t=10?",Yes,"Since BeamSearch always keep only the resulting best k (=beam size) candidates in every time step, 20 sentences would be generated till timestep t=10.","There are multiple approaches that can be used to generate a sentence givenan image, with NIC. The first one is Sampling where we justsample the first word according to p_{1}, then provide the correspondingembedding as input and sample p_{2}, continuing like this until we sample thespecial end-of-sentence token or some maximum length.The second one is BeamSearch: iterativelyconsider the set of the k best sentences up to timet as candidates to generate sentences of size t+1, and keep only theresulting best k of them. This better approximatesS=\arg\max_{S^{\prime}}p(S^{\prime}|I).We used the BeamSearch approach in the following experiments, with abeam of size 20.

"Would more recent frameworks, such as JAX be considered imperative or declarative?","No, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do not generally succeed in sequence modeling.

Possible programming paradigms range from imperative,where the user specifies exactly “how” computation needs to beperformed, and declarative, where the user specification focuses on“what” to be done. Examples of imperative programming include numpy andMatlab, whereas packages such as Caffe, CXXNet program over layer definitionwhich abstracts away and hide the inner-working of actual implementation. The dividing line between the two can be muddy at times. Frameworkssuch as Theano and the more recent Tensorflow can also be viewed as a mixture of both, they declare a computational graph, yet the computation within the graph is imperatively specified."

The SuperNaturalInstructions dataset aims to tackle the bottleneck of human annotation dependence and provide a testbed for evaluating instruction-based models' generalizability to unseen tasks, while the NaturalInstructions dataset is more focused on research purposes and skewed towards classification tasks","Lazy evalution is the way of evalution of data like NDArray, which the actual data push and pull are scheduled by the backend engine so that the data dependency can be correctly resolved.","The above is as efficient as the implementation using a single but often much more complex symbolic expression.The reason is that MXNet uses lazy evaluation of NDArray and the backendengine can correctly resolve the data dependency between the two. The above mixed implementation has the same performance comparing to a singledeclarative program, because the actual data push and pull are executed by lazyevaluation, which are scheduled by the backend engine just like others."
Can collective communication primitives such as all_reduce or all_gather be implemented using MXNet?,"YES.

"Why do the authors use heuristics to estimate a variable's life span in the computational graph, instead of calculating it exactly?","Yes. Breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems and using separate LMs to solve each module can increase computation, as it requires more computational resources and time to solve multiple modules compared to solving a single, larger problem","While calculating the variable's estimated life span costs quadratic time complexity, heuristics costs only linear time complexity which is much efficient. Also, experimental results show that heuristics can reduce the memory footprint effectively.","Memory Allocation.Note that each variable’s life time, namely the period between thecreation and the last time will be used, is known for a computation graph.So we can reuse memory for non-intersected variables.However, an ideal allocation strategy requires O(n^{2}) timecomplexity, where n is the number of variables. We proposed two heuristics strategies with linear time complexity.The first, called inplace, simulates the procedure of traversingthe graph, and keeps a reference counter of depended nodes that are not used sofar. If the counter reaches zero, the memory is recycled.The second, named co-share, allows two nodes to share a piece of memory if only ifthey cannot be run in parallel. Exploring co-share imposes one additionaldependency constraint.In particular, each time upon scheduling, among the pending paths in the graph, we find the longest path and perform needed memory allocations. Figure 7 shows the memory usages of the internal variables excepts for the outputs.As can be seen, both “inplace” and “co-share” can effective reduce the memoryfootprint. Combing them leads to a 2x reduction for all networks during modeltraining, and further improves to 4x for model prediction. For instance,even for the most expensive VGG net, training needs less than 16MB extra."

"Would functional programming languages be considered to be a part of the imperative or the declarative paradigm, or neither?","Sure! Here's my answer:

Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) is a technique used to improve the training of two-stage detectors by selectively choosing the most challenging examples for training","Although the paper describes the difference of imperative and declarative paradigm of the programming language, this question cannot be answered and requires external knowledges since there are no evidential information about the functional programming languages.","Most ML systems embed a domain-specific language (DSL) into a host language(e.g. Python, Lua, C++). Possible programming paradigms range from imperative,where the user specifies exactly “how” computation needs to beperformed, and declarative, where the user specification focuses on“what” to be done. Examples of imperative programming include numpy andMatlab, whereas packages such as Caffe, CXXNet program over layer definitionwhich abstracts away and hide the inner-working of actual implementation. The dividing line between the two can be muddy at times. Frameworkssuch as Theano and the more recent Tensorflow can also be viewed as a mixture of both, they declare a computational graph, yet the computation within the graph is imperatively specified."
Does the paper report empirical benchmarks for performance on non-GPU devices (eg. edge devices such as mobile phones)? ,"GAT can learn regardless of the graph structure because it does not require knowing the entire graph upfront, allowing for efficient and parallelizable computation on large graphs","While the paper reports the experimental result on GPU device (Nvidia GTX980 card), the result on non-GPU devices is not included in the paper.","We fist compare MXNet with Torch7, Caffe, and TensorFlow on the popular“convnet-benchmarks” [2]. All these systems are compiled with CUDA 7.5 andCUDNN 3 except for TensorFlow, which only supports CUDA 7.0 and CUDNN 2. We usebatch size 32 for all networks and run the experiments on a single Nvidia GTX980 card. Results are shown in Figure 7. As expected thatMXNet has similar performance comparing to Torch7 and Caffe, because mostcomputations are spent on the CUDA/CUDNN kernels. TensorFlow is always 2xslower, which might be due its use of a lower CUDNN version."
What metrics are used to measure performance on segmentation tasks?,"The authors could have used factors such as the number of classes, the size of the dataset, and the desired level of accuracy improvement to decide the number of specialists to allocate for their task",mIOU is used to measure performance on segmentation tasks.,"In this section, we compare MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 models used as feature extractors with DeepLabv3 [39] for the task of mobile semantic segmentation.DeepLabv3 adopts atrous convolution [40, 41, 42], a powerful tool to explicitly control the resolution of computed feature maps, and builds five parallel heads including (a) Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module (ASPP) [43] containing three 3\times 3 convolutions with different atrous rates, (b) 1\times 1 convolution head, and (c) Image-level features [44].We denote by output_stride the ratio of input image spatial resolution to final output resolution, which is controlled by applying the atrous convolution properly.For semantic segmentation, we usually employ \emph{output\_stride}=16 or 8 for denser feature maps.We conduct the experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset [3], with extra annotated images from [45] and evaluation metric mIOU."
Define how a linear convolution layer functions.,"Sure! Here's my answer:

A Hamiltonian path is a path in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex, using every edge exactly once",Linear convolution layer projects the filtered high-dimensional representation to low-dimensional subspace.,Our main contribution is a novel layer module: the inverted residual with linear bottleneck. This module takes as an input a low-dimensional compressed representation which is first expanded to high dimension and filtered with a lightweight depthwise convolution. Features are subsequently projected back to a low-dimensional representation with a linear convolution. The official implementation is available as part of TensorFlow-Slim model library in [4].
Do the authors evaluate their architecture on non-mobile/cellphone type of edge devices such as FPGAs?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

YOLOv3 struggles to get the boxes perfectly aligned with the object, which leads to a drop in performance as the IOU threshold increases",The authors only evaluated their architecture on mobile devices (Google Pixel 1) and did not evaluated on non-mobile type of devices.,"Table 4: Performance on ImageNet, comparison for different networks. As is common practice for ops, we count the total number of Multiply-Adds.

"Given an input tensor of size (224, 224, 16), a convolution layer transforms the input to an output tensor of size (224, 224, 8), what would the computational cost of this operation  be according to this paper?","Fusion refers to the process of combining data from multiple sensors or sources to obtain a more accurate and complete estimate of the environment. In the context of SLAM, fusion is used to combine data from different sensors, such as stereo and RGB-D, to improve the accuracy and robustness of the estimated pose and map","with hi = 224, wi = 224, di = 16 and dj = 8, the computation cost of this operation would be 224 × 224 × 16 × 8 × k × k = 6,422,528 × k^2.","Standard convolution takes an h_{i}\times w_{i}\times d_{i} input tensor L_{i}, and applies convolutional kernel K\in{\cal R}^{k\times k\times d_{i}\times d_{j}} to produce an h_{i}\times w_{i}\times d_{j} output tensor L_{j}.Standard convolutional layers have the computational cost of h_{i}\cdot w_{i}\cdot d_{i}\cdot d_{j}\cdot k\cdot k."
What differentiates a bottleneck block from a residual block?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

No. The task categories in the presented benchmark are not the same as the types of tasks mentioned in the abstract","Inverted residuals differentiates a bottleneck block from a residual block, which shortcuts directly between the bottlenecks.","The bottleneck blocks appear similar to residual block where each block contains an input followed by several bottlenecks then followed by expansion [8].However, inspired by the intuition that the bottlenecks actually contain all the necessary information, while an expansion layer acts merely as an implementation detail that accompanies a non-linear transformation of the tensor, we use shortcuts directly between the bottlenecks.Figure 3 provides a schematic visualization of the difference in the designs.The motivation for inserting shortcuts is similar to that of classical residual connections: we want to improve the ability of a gradient to propagate across multiplier layers.However, the inverted design is considerably more memory efficient (see Section 4 for details), as well as works slightly better in our experiments."
What is the key difference in model structure between Mobilenet style models and Shufflenet? ,"Deep spatial features of the noisy image \phi(z_t) are different from the noisy image z_t in that they capture more abstract and hierarchical representations of the image, while the noisy image z_t represents the raw, low-level features of the image","ShuffleNet introduces group convolutions and shuffling, while existing mobilenet style models do not have.","Figure 4: Comparison of convolutional blocks for different architectures. ShuffleNet uses Group Convolutions [20] and shuffling, it also uses conventional residual approach where inner blocks are narrower than output. ShuffleNet and NasNet illustrations are from respective papers."
"When discussing the information flow interpretation, the authors mention how expressiveness and capacity of their model can be independently analyse. What does ""capacity"" in this context mean?","3:4, or 75:25","In this paper, capacity is the input/output domain of the bottleneck layers, which can be separated from the expressiveness part (layer transformation) for the proposed architecture.","One interesting property of our architecture is that it provides a natural separation between the input/output domains of the building blocks (bottleneck layers), and the layer transformation – that is a non-linear function that converts input to the output.The former can be seen as the capacity of the network at each layer, whereas the latter as the expressiveness.This is in contrast with traditional convolutional blocks, both regular and separable, where both expressiveness and capacity are tangled together and are functions of the output layer depth."
How does RELU6 differ from vanilla RELU?,"No. The local subvolume approach allows the model to focus on specific regions of the object, which can be more informative and challenging than training on the entire object. This design can actually improve the model's performance by exploiting the discriminative power of local regions",RELU6 is more robust compared to vanilla RELU when used with low-precision computation. How RELU6 is calculated is not included in this paper and thus requires external knowledge to be answered.,"Now we describe our architecture in detail. As discussed in the previous section thebasic building block is a bottleneck depth-separable convolution with residuals.The detailed structureof this block is shown in Table 1. The architecture of MobileNetV2 contains the initial fully convolution layer with 32 filters, followed by 19 residual bottleneck layers described in the Table 2. We use {\operatorname{\mathop{ReLU6}\,}} as the non-linearity because of its robustness when used with low-precision computation [27]. We always use kernel size 3\times 3 as is standard for modern networks, and utilize dropout and batch normalization during training."
The authors mention that their primary network has a compute cost of 300 million multiply-adds. By how many orders of magnitude would this compute cost increase if the authors did not use bottleneck layers?,"No.

Each channel of the position-sensitive score maps learned by R-FCN maps the response from the same position of the image, but with different orientations. The kxk spatial grid describes relative positions within the object category, so each channel corresponds to a different orientation of the object","The compute cost when using traditional layers are h · w · d' · d'' · k^2, so the cost would be increase by a factor of d'' · k^2/t(d' + k^2 + d'').","The basic implementation structure is illustrated in Table 1.For a block of size h\times w, expansion factor t and kernel size k with d^{\prime} input channels and d^{\prime\prime} output channels, the total number of multiply add required ish\cdot w\cdot d^{\prime}\cdot t(d^{\prime}+k^{2}+d^{\prime\prime}).Compared with (1) this expression has an extra term, as indeed we have an extra 1\times 1 convolution, however the nature of our networks allows us to utilize much smaller input and output dimensions.In Table 3 we compare the needed sizes for each resolution between MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNet."
Do the authors measure the quantify the impact on their model's performance when using RELU6 instead of RELU?,"No, the action space of language modeling is not solely due to the vocabulary size. While the vocabulary size is a contributing factor, the action space is larger because of the inherent structure of language.

In language modeling, the action space includes not only the vocabulary size but also the order and sequence of tokens. This means that the number of possible actions is exponentially larger than the vocabulary size, making it challenging to learn and optimize policies.

In contrast, the action space in the real world, such as degrees of movement, is discrete and finite, making it easier to learn and optimize policies. Therefore, the action space of language modeling is particularly large due to the inherent structure of language, rather than just the vocabulary size","While the authors showed the effect of inverted residual connections and linear bottlenecks, they did not measure the impact of using RELU6 instead of RELU in the ablation study.","The importance of residual connection has been studied extensively [8, 30, 46]. The new result reported in this paper is that the shortcut connecting bottleneck perform better than shortcuts connecting the expanded layers (see Figure 6b for comparison). The linear bottleneck models are strictly less powerful than models with non-linearities, because the activations can always operate in linear regime with appropriate changes to biases and scaling. However our experiments shown in Figure 6a indicate that linear bottlenecks improve performance, providing support that non-linearity destroys information in low-dimensional space."
What are the likely problems authors would have encountered if they did not use batch normalization and dropout during training?,To maintain a similar computational cost,"Since there is no evidential information about the effect of batch normalization and dropout, this question cannot be answered and requires external knowledges.","The architecture of MobileNetV2 contains the initial fully convolution layer with 32 filters, followed by 19 residual bottleneck layers described in the Table 2.

Why is running information on resource-constrained environments an important concern when GPUs are becoming more commonplace today?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

However, the drive to improve accuracy often comes at a cost: modern state of the art networks require high computational resources beyond the capabilities of many mobile and embedded applications."
What hyperparameters do each of the eight variants of LSTMs investigated by the authors of this paper have?,"The difference between the black and orange lines can be specifically interpreted from a musical perspective as a difference in the expressive attributes of the two samples, such as dynamics, articulation, and tempo, which are influenced by the different structural attributes of the musical piece",The authors investigated 1) number of LSTM blocks per hidden layer 2) learning rate 3) momentum 4) standard deviation of Gaussian input noise with random searches with uniform sampling.,"We performed 27 random searches (one for each combination of the nine variants and three datasets).Each random search encompasses 200 trials for a total of 5400 trials of randomly sampling the following hyperparameters:•number of LSTM blocks per hidden layer:log-uniform samples from [20,200];•learning rate:log-uniform samples from [10^{-6},10^{-2}];•momentum:1-\text{log-uniform samples from $[0.01,1.0]$};•standard deviation of Gaussian input noise:uniform samples from [0,1]."
"The authors mention that they measure performance of their models using the character error rate metric, which they calculate using best path encoding. What does ""best path"" here mean?","By using an iterative approximation algorithm and approximating gradients in different ways to stabilize and accelerate the learning process, but with a potential risk of larger error compared to standard SVD as the matrix size grows","Since there is no evidential information about the detail of best path decoding, this question cannot be answered and requires external knowledge, specifically the reference [39].",The networks were trained using the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) error function by Graves et al.

What does MIDI sequencing mean?,"Sure! Here's the answer to the question at the end of the context:

To improve the accuracy of their model on mentions without correct entity in their candidate lists","Because ""MIDI sequence"" is not used as an action in this paper, MIDI sequencing does not make sense and thus cannot be answered.","JSB Chorales is a collection of 382 four-part harmonized chorales by J.

How is Nesterov-style momentum different from other momentum based optimizers such as Adam/AdamW?,"The main difference between the experiments on MultiWOZ and ConvLab is that MultiWOZ is a dataset-based automatic evaluation, while ConvLab is a simulator-based evaluation","Since there is no evidential information about the detail of how Nesterov-style momentum and other optimizers works, this question cannot be answered and requires external knowledge.","In the case of the TIMIT dataset, two additional (boolean) hyperparameters were considered (not tuned for the other two datasets).The first one was the choice between traditional momentum and Nesterov-style momentum [42]. Our analysis showed that this had no measurable effect on performance so the latter was arbitrarily chosen for all further experiments.The second one was whether to clip the gradients to the range [-1,1]. This turned out to hurt overall performance,666Although this may very well be the result of the range having been chosen too tightly. therefore the gradients were never clipped in the case of the other two datasets."
The results section concludes that momentum affected neither the training compute cost nor the performance - why was this a surprising or unexpected result?,"No. RPN is not used as a secondary classifier for proposing boundary boxes in the Faster R-CNN (F-RCNN) framework. Instead, it is used to generate a set of candidate proposals that are then fed into the F-RCNN network for classification and refinement",It is not clear why was the result an unexpected result since there is no evidential information of what the authors expected when choosing the hyperparameters to assess their importance.,"One unexpected result of this study is that momentum affects neither performance nor training time in any significant way.This follows from the observation that for none of the datasets, momentum accounted for more than 1% of the variance of test set performance.It should be noted that for TIMIT the interaction between learning rate and momentum accounts for 2.5% of the total variance, but as with learning rate \times hidden size (cf. Interaction of Hyperparameters below) it does not reveal any interpretable structure.This may be the result of our choice to scale learning rates dependent on momentum (Section IV-B).These observations suggest that momentum does not offer substantial benefits when training LSTMs with online stochastic gradient descent. As expected, the learning rate is the most crucial hyperparameter, followed by the network size.Surprisingly though, the use of momentum was found to be unimportant in our setting of online gradient descent.Gaussian noise on the inputs was found to be moderately helpful for TIMIT, but harmful for the other datasets."
How did the authors ensure that fair comparison between the 9 variants of LSTMs they analysed?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

No.

According to the context, the authors did not try different hyperparameters for the benchmarking algorithm. Instead, they report the average accuracy on the test set after repeating each algorithm 5 times with shuffled training data","To ensure the fair comparison that needs to be similar for each variant, the authors tuned the hyperparameters individually for each variant, and use random search to 1) obtain good hyperparameters and 2) collect enough amount of samples for analyzing the general effect of each variant.","For fair comparison, the setup needs to be similar for each variant.Different variants might require different settings of hyperparameters to give good performance, and we are interested in the best performance that can be achieved with each variant.For this reason we chose to tune the hyperparameters like learning rate or amount of input noise individually for each variant.Since hyperparameter space is large and impossible to traverse completely, random search was used in order to obtain good-performing hyperparameters [18] for every combination of variant and dataset.Random search was also chosen for the added benefit of providing enough data for analyzing the general effect of various hyperparameters on the performance of each LSTM variant (Section V-B)."
What are the eight different LSTM variants that the authors experimented with?,"The authors did not use previous studies as baseline models because they wanted to focus on flexible musical expressions and personal interpretation, rather than following a composer's intent or imitating existing performances","The authors conducted the experiment with these LSTM variants of the vanilla architecture to empirically compare different LSTM variants: No Input Gate (NIG), No Forget Gate (NFG), No Output Gate (NOG), No Input Activation Function (NIAF), No Output Activation Function (NOAF), Coupled Input and Forget Gate (CIFG), No Peepholes (NP), Full Gate Recurrence (FGR).","The focus of our study is to empirically compare different LSTM variants, and not to achieve state-of-the-art results.Therefore, our experiments are designed to keep the setup simple and the comparisons fair.The vanilla LSTM is used as a baseline and evaluated together with eight of its variants.Each variant adds, removes, or modifies the baseline in exactly one aspect, which allows to isolate their effect.They are evaluated on three different datasets from different domains to account for cross-domain variations. This paper reports the results of a large scale study on variants of the LSTM architecture. We conclude that the most commonly used LSTM architecture (vanilla LSTM) performs reasonably well on various datasets.None of the eight investigated modifications significantly improves performance.However, certain modifications such as coupling the input and forget gates (CIFG) or removing peephole connections (NP) simplified LSTMs in our experiments without significantly decreasing performance.These two variants are also attractive because they reduce the number of parameters and the computational cost of the LSTM. The first important observation based on Figure 3 is that removing the output activation function (NOAF) or the forget gate (NFG) significantly hurt performance on all three datasets. Apart from the CEC, the ability to forget old information and the squashing of the cell state appear to be critical for the LSTM architecture. Indeed, without the output activation function, the block output can in principle grow unbounded. Coupling the input and the forget gate avoids this problem and might render the use of an output non-linearity less important, which could explain why GRU performs well without it. Adding full gate recurrence (FGR) did not significantly change performance on TIMIT or IAM Online, but led to worse results on the JSB Chorales dataset. Given that this variant greatly increases the number of parameters, we generally advise against using it. Note that this feature was present in the original proposal of LSTM [14, 15], but has been absent in all following studies. Removing the input gate (NIG), the output gate (NOG), and the input activation function (NIAF) led to a significant reduction in performance on speech and handwriting recognition. However, there was no significant effect on music modeling performance. A small (but statistically insignificant) average performance improvement was observed for the NIG and NIAF architectures on music modeling. We hypothesize that these behaviors will generalize to similar problems such as language modeling. For supervised learning on continuous real-valued data (such as speech and handwriting recognition), the input gate, output gate, and input activation function are all crucial for obtaining good performance."
Do the authors use different ratios of test-train-validation split for each dataset? ,Xilinx Vertex-7 FPGA,"The authors use different ratios of test-train-validation split for each dataset. Speficially, the authors did not use the predefined ratio value when splitting the data into train-validation-test sets for the three datasets (TIMIT Speech corpus, IAM Online Handwriting Database, and JSB Chorales dataset) used in the experiment. Instead, they used the predefined data split for IAM Online Handwriting Database and JSB Chorales dataset. (5355:3859:2956 and 229:77:76) They also followed Halberstadt [37] in splitting the TIMIT dataset (3696:400:192).","The performance is measured as classification error percentage. The training, testing, and validation sets are split in line with Halberstadt [37] into 3696, 400, and 192 sequences, having 304 frames on average. The TIMIT Speech corpus [26] is large enough to be a reasonable acoustic modeling benchmark for speech recognition, yet it is small enough to keep a large study such as ours manageable. Our experiments focus on the frame-wise classification task for this dataset, where the objective is to classify each audio-frame as one of 61 phones.2 From the raw audio we extract 12 Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCCs) [35] + energy over 25ms hamming-windows with stride of 10ms and a pre-emphasis coefficient of 0.97. This preprocessing is standard in speech recognition and was chosen in order to stay comparable with earlier LSTM-based results (e.g. [20, 36]). The 13 coefficients along with their first and second derivatives comprise the 39 inputs to the network and were normalized to have zero mean and unit variance. The IAM Online Handwriting Database [38] consists of English sentences as time series of pen movements that have to be mapped to characters. The IAM-OnDB dataset splits into one training set, two validation sets, and one test set, having 775, 192, 216, and 544 boards each. Each board, see Figure 2(a), contains multiple hand-written lines, which in turn consist of several strokes. We use one line per sequence, and joined the two validation sets together, so the final training, validation, and testing sets contain 5355, 2956 and 3859 sequences respectively. JSB Chorales: JSB Chorales is a collection of 382 four part harmonized chorales by J. S. Bach [40], consisting of 202 chorales in major keys and 180 chorals in minor keys. We used the preprocessed piano-rolls provided by Boulanger, Lewandowski et al.

Define how fANOVA is performed?,To avoid the prototype embeddings from dominating the query embeddings,fANOVA marginalize over hyperparameter dimensions using regression trees to predict the marginal error for single parameter while averaging over all other parameters.,"The fANOVA framework for assessing hyperparameter importance by Hutter et al. [19] is based on the observation that marginalizing over dimensions can be done efficiently in regression trees.This allows predicting the marginal error for one hyperparameter while averaging over all the others.Traditionally this would require a full hyperparameter grid search, whereas here the hyperparameter space can be sampled at random."
"The authors say, ""a very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to average their predictions"". What is this technique called?","Sure! Here are two examples that fit the case:

1. Adversarial training: Despite the success of supervised end-to-end learning in computer vision, there is still a need for training models to be robust against adversarial attacks, which cannot be fully addressed by supervised learning.
2. Multi-modal learning: Supervised end-to-end learning primarily focuses on single-modal input data, but there are many applications where multiple modalities need to be combined, such as in natural language processing or multimodal sentiment analysis, which cannot be fully covered by supervised end-to-end learning","The authors define an “ensemble of models” as a set of separate models with the same architecture and training procedure, but different randomly initialized parameters whose predictions are then averaged to increase performance.","We trained 10 separate models to predict P(h_{t}|\mathbf{s}_{t};\boldsymbol{\theta}), using exactly the same architecture and trainingprocedure as the baseline. The models are randomly initialized with different initial parameter values and we find thatthis creates sufficient diversity in the trained models to allow the averaged predictions of the ensemble tosignificantly outperform the individual models. We have explored adding diversity to the models by varying the sets ofdata that each model sees, but we found this to not significantly change our results, so we opted for the simplerapproach. For the distillation we tried temperatures of [1,{\bf 2},5,10] and used a relative weight of 0.5 on thecross-entropy for the hard targets, where bold font indicates the best value that was used fortable 1 ."
"The authors proposed approach only works for classification models, and not for models that have other types of outputs. True or False?","The improvement in accuracy with facts in the Sign Agreement module is likely due to the model being able to select two facts, allowing it to capture more information and make more accurate predictions","In this work, the approach assumes that there are classes that the models should be able to predict. The work focuses on classification models. Thus, whether the approach can work on models with other types of outputs cannot be answered from this paper.","In this section we give an example of such a dataset and we show howlearning specialist models that each focus on a different confusablesubset of the classes can reduce the total amount of computationrequired to learn an ensemble. The main problem with specialists thatfocus on making fine-grained distinctions is that they overfit veryeasily and we describe how this overfitting may be prevented by usingsoft targets. In order to derive groupings of object categories for the specialists, we decided to focus on categories that our fullnetwork often confuses. Even though we could have computed the confusion matrix and used it as a way to find suchclusters, we opted for a simpler approach that does not require the true labels to construct the clusters. In particular, we apply a clustering algorithm to the covariance matrix of the predictions of our generalist model, so that a set of classes S m that are often predicted together will be used as targets for one of our specialist models, m. We applied an on-line version of the K-means algorithm to the columns of the covariance matrix, and obtained reasonable clusters (shown in Table 2). We tried several clustering algorithms which produced similar results."
What is the numeric value of dropout fraction used during the training phase?,(2) TDQN and (4) MC!Q*BERT are the planning-based RL algorithms,The neural net in this work was strongly regularized using dropout and weight constraints as described in [5]. The specific numeric value of the dropout fraction used for training cannot be answered from this paper.,"To see how well distillation works, we trained a single large neuralnet with two hidden layers of 1200 rectified linear hidden units onall 60,000 training cases. The net was strongly regularized usingdropout and weight-constraints as described in [5]. Dropoutcan be viewed as a way of training an exponentially large ensemble ofmodels that share weights. In addition, the input images were jitteredby up to two pixels in any direction. This net achieved 67 testerrors whereas a smaller net with two hidden layers of 800 rectifiedlinear hidden units and no regularization achieved 146 errors. But ifthe smaller net was regularized solely by adding the additional taskof matching the soft targets produced by the large net at atemperature of 20, it achieved 74 test errors. This shows that softtargets can transfer a great deal of knowledge to the distilled model,including the knowledge about how to generalize that is learned fromtranslated training data even though the transfer set does not containany translations."
"What does ""temperature"" mean in context of the authors' proposed model?","Yes. Based on the results of the experiments with ProofWriter Tafjord et al. (2020) and PrOntoQA Saparov and He (2022), it is likely that the results will be similar for 5 hops. The deductive accuracy and ability to generate valid reasoning chains of Lambada will remain high, while other techniques may still struggle with spurious proof traces and lower query efficiency","Temperature is a value used in the softmax output layer. The softmax layer converts the logit computed for each class into a probability by comparing with other logits and increasing the temperature produces a softer probability distribution over classes. Specifically, in distillation, a high temperature is used in the cumbersome model to produce a soft target distribution for each case in the transfer set.","In the simplest form of distillation, knowledge is transferred to the distilled model by training it on a transfer setand using a soft target distribution for each case in the transfer set that is produced by using the cumbersome modelwith a high temperature in its softmax. The same high temperature is used when training the distilled model, but afterit has been trained it uses a temperature of 1. Neural networks typically produce class probabilities by using a “softmax” output layer that converts the logit, zi , computed for each class into a probability, qi , by comparing zi with the other logits. qi = exp(zi/T ) P j exp(zj/T ) (1) 2 where T is a temperature that is normally set to 1. Using a higher value for T produces a softer probability distribution over classes."
The authors use a different number of layers and rectified units for experiments on MNIST and speech recognition. What factors might the authors have considered while deciding on these numbers?,"The result that momentum did not affect training compute cost or performance was surprising because it was expected to have a positive impact, based on previous research and the authors' own hypotheses","For speech recognition, the architecture was based on the acoustic model used by Android voice search. For MNIST, the architecture was strongly regularized using dropout and weight constraints as described in prior work. This suggests that the authors considered prior work while deciding these numbers. However, all the factors that authors might have considered when deciding on the number of layers and rectified units cannot be answered from this paper.","To see how well distillation works, we trained a single large neuralnet with two hidden layers of 1200 rectified linear hidden units onall 60,000 training cases. The net was strongly regularized usingdropout and weight-constraints as described in [5]. Dropoutcan be viewed as a way of training an exponentially large ensemble ofmodels that share weights. In addition, the input images were jitteredby up to two pixels in any direction. This net achieved 67 testerrors whereas a smaller net with two hidden layers of 800 rectifiedlinear hidden units and no regularization achieved 146 errors. But ifthe smaller net was regularized solely by adding the additional taskof matching the soft targets produced by the large net at atemperature of 20, it achieved 74 test errors. This shows that softtargets can transfer a great deal of knowledge to the distilled model,including the knowledge about how to generalize that is learned fromtranslated training data even though the transfer set does not containany translations. We use an architecture with 8 hidden layers each containing 2560 rectified linear units and a final softmax layer with14,000 labels (HMM targets h_{t}). The input is 26 frames of 40 Mel-scaled filterbank coefficients with a 10ms advanceper frame and we predict the HMM state of 21{}^{st} frame. The total number of parameters is about 85M. This is aslightly outdated version of the acoustic model used by Android voice search, and should be considered as a very strongbaseline. To train the DNN acoustic model we use about 2000 hours of spoken English data, which yields about 700Mtraining examples. This system achieves a frame accuracy of 58.9%, and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 10.9% on our development set."
"For the speech recognition task, based on the information provided by the authors on the total number of samples in the dataset, how long (in seconds) is each training sample?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

MRR@10","P0: According to the authors, they used about 2000 hours of spoken English data which yielded about 700M training examples. Approximately, the length of the average training sample would be 0.01 seconds. The specific length of each training sample cannot be answered from this paper.","We use an architecture with 8 hidden layers each containing 2560 rectified linear units and a final softmax layer with14,000 labels (HMM targets h_{t}).

What is the main difference between synchronous vs asynchronous SGD?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

5","In training of Google’s baseline model of JFT, asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) involved running replicas of the neural net different sets of cores to compute gradients on given mini-batches, which are then sent to a shared parameter server which returns new values for the parameters. The general definitions of asynchronous and synchronous SGD, and, thus, their differences cannot be answered from this paper.","JFT is an internal Google dataset that has 100 million labeled imageswith 15,000 labels. When we did this work, Google’s baseline model forJFT was a deep convolutional neural network [7] that had been trained forabout six months using asynchronous stochastic gradient descent on alarge number of cores. This training used two types ofparallelism [2]. First, there were many replicas of the neural net runningon different sets of cores and processing different mini-batches fromthe training set. Each replica computes the average gradient on itscurrent mini-batch and sends this gradient to a sharded parameter server whichsends back new values for the parameters. These new values reflect allof the gradients received by the parameter server since the last timeit sent parameters to the replica. Second, each replica is spread overmultiple cores by putting different subsets of the neurons on eachcore. Ensemble training is yet a third type of parallelism that can bewrapped around the other two types, but only if a lot more cores areavailable. Waiting for several years to train an ensemble of models wasnot an option, so we needed a much faster way to improve the baselinemodel."
What optimizer did the authors used for the distilled models?,"Yes, recent methods can be used to re-generate unreachable images for medical tasks",The model was trained with a distributed stochastic gradient descent approach.,"Although it is possible (and desirable) to train the DNN in such a way that the decoder (and, thus, the language model) is taken into account by marginalizing over all possible paths, it is common to train the DNN to perform frame-by-frame classification by (locally) minimizing the cross entropy between the predictions made by the net and the labels given by a forced alignment with the ground truth sequence of states for each observation: θ = arg max θ ′ P(ht|st; θ ′ ) where θ are the parameters of our acoustic model P which maps acoustic observations at time t, st, to a probability, P(ht|st; θ ′ ) , of the “correct” HMM state ht, which is determined by a forced alignment with the correct sequence of words. The model is trained with a distributed stochastic gradient descent approach."
Would more recent approaches such as DECAF extreme classification (2021) serve as a stronger baseline than the specialized models discussed in the paper?,"The two roles of the autoencoder in the proposed model are:

1. Learning high-quality app embeddings from co-occurrence relationships.
2. Providing effective representations of user retention for the transformer part","The specialist models were started from the baseline model which was Google’s deep convolutional network for JFT. The function and performance of DECAF, and how it compares to the JFT baseline model used in this work cannot be answered from this paper.","Starting from the trained baseline full network,the specialists train extremely fast (a few days instead of many weeks for JFT). Also, all the specialistsare trained completely independently. Table  3 shows the absolute test accuracy for thebaseline system and the baseline system combined with the specialistmodels. With 61 specialist models, there is a4.4% relative improvement in test accuracy overall. We also report conditional test accuracy, which is the accuracy by only considering examples belonging to the specialist classes, and restricting our predictions to that subset of classes. JFT is an internal Google dataset that has 100 million labeled images with 15,000 labels. When we did this work, Google’s baseline model for JFT was a deep convolutional neural network [7] that had been trained for about six months using asynchronous stochastic gradient descent on a large number of cores.

Waiting for several years to train an ensemble of models was not an option, so we needed a much faster way to improve the baseline model."
Is the KMeans algorithm discussed in the paper require a labelled dataset?,"The online encoder is updated to minimize the loss, while the target encoder is updated slowly to approximate the online encoder","The K-means algorithm clusters the set of classes that the models often predict together. In this work, this clustering approach did not require true labels. However, the models themselves were trained using examples from a dataset, JFT, which contains labeled images. Thus, although the K-means algorithm does not require a labeled dataset, the models whose predictions are used in the algorithm required a labeled dataset.","JFT is an internal Google dataset that has 100 million labeled imageswith 15,000 labels.

Waiting for several years to train an ensemble of models wasnot an option, so we needed a much faster way to improve the baselinemodel. In order to derive groupings of object categories for the specialists, we decided to focus on categories that our fullnetwork often confuses. Even though we could have computed the confusion matrix and used it as a way to find suchclusters, we opted for a simpler approach that does not require the true labels to construct the clusters. In particular, we apply a clustering algorithm to the covariance matrix of the predictions of our generalist model, so thata set of classes S^{m} that are often predicted together will be used as targets for one of our specialist models, m. We applied an on-lineversion of the K-means algorithm to the columns of the covariance matrix, and obtained reasonable clusters (shown inTable 2). We tried several clustering algorithms which produced similar results. To reduce overfitting and share the work of learning lower level feature detectors, each specialist model is initialized with the weights of the generalist model. These weights are then slightly modified by training the specialist with half its examples coming from its special subset and half sampled at random from the remainder of the training set. After training, we can correct for the biased training set by incrementing the logit of the dustbin class by the log of the proportion by which the specialist class is oversampled."
Define KL divergence.,To introduce no extra parameters or computational complexity while allowing for fair comparisons between plain and residual networks,"In this work, KL divergence is computed between the probability distribution of a specialist model or generalist full model and the full probability distribution over all classes. The definition of KL divergence cannot be answered from this paper.","Step 2: We then take all the specialist models, m, whose specialsubset of confusable classes,S^{m}, has a non-empty intersection with k and call this the activeset of specialists A_{k} (note that this set may be empty). We thenfind the full probability distribution \mathbf{q} over all the classesthat minimizes:KL(\mathbf{p}^{g},\mathbf{q})+\sum_{m\in A_{k}}KL(\mathbf{p}^{m},\mathbf{q})(5)where KL denotes the KL divergence, and \mathbf{p}^{m} \mathbf{p}^{g} denote theprobability distribution of a specialist model or the generalist fullmodel. The distribution \mathbf{p}^{m} is a distribution over all thespecialist classes of m plus a single dustbin class, so whencomputing its KL divergence from the full \mathbf{q} distribution we sumall of the probabilities that the full \mathbf{q} distribution assigns toall the classes in m’s dustbin."
"When discussing the JFT specialist training, the authors refer to a ""dustbin"" class. Give an example of a sample that might be assigned to this class.",Yes,The dustbin class was the combination of all of the classes that a specialist does not care about. Examples of samples that might be assigned to the dustbin class cannot be provided from this paper.,"When the number of classes is very large, it makes sense for thecumbersome model to be an ensemble that contains one generalistmodel trained on all the data and many “specialist”models, each of which is trained on data that is highly enriched inexamples from a very confusable subset of the classes (like differenttypes of mushroom). The softmax of this type of specialist can be mademuch smaller by combining all of the classes it does not care about into asingle dustbin class. The specialists that we used in our experiments on the JFT datasetcollapsed all of their non-specialist classes into a single dustbinclass. If we allow specialists to have a full softmax over allclasses, there may be a much better way to prevent them overfitting than usingearly stopping. A specialist is trained on data that is highlyenriched in its special classes. This means that the effective sizeof its training set is much smaller and it has a strong tendency tooverfit on its special classes. This problem cannot be solved bymaking the specialist a lot smaller because then we lose the veryhelpful transfer effects we get from modeling all of thenon-specialist classes."
What factors could the authors have used while deciding the number of specialists to allocate for their task?,"Identity shortcuts are shortcuts that use the original input dimensions without any transformation or projection, while projection shortcuts are shortcuts that use a projection operation to reduce the dimensionality of the input. In the experiments, identity shortcuts are used to preserve the original input dimensions and prevent residual learning, while projection shortcuts are used to reduce the dimensionality of the input and introduce extra parameters to improve performance","P0: Through results shown in Table 4, the authors saw a general trend that accuracy improved when more specialists covered a particular class. This could have been a factor that authors considered in deciding on the number of specialists for their task.","For our JFT specialist experiments, we trained 61 specialist models, each with 300 classes (plus the dustbin class).Because the sets of classes for the specialists are not disjoint, we often had multiple specialists covering aparticular image class. Table  4 shows the number of test set examples, the change inthe number of examples correct at position 1 when using the specialist(s), and the relative percentage improvement intop1 accuracy for the JFT dataset broken down by the number of specialists covering the class. We are encouraged by thegeneral trend that accuracy improvements are larger when we have more specialists covering a particular class, sincetraining independent specialist models is very easy to parallelize."
How are mixture of expert gating functions designed?,Yes,"In a mixture of experts, the gating function is a network that is learned to choose which experts to assign to each example through the relative discriminative performance of the experts on the sample.","The use of specialists that are trained on subsets of the data hassome resemblance to mixtures of experts [6] which use agating network to compute the probability of assigning each example toeach expert. At the same time as the experts are learning to deal withthe examples assigned to them, the gating network is learning tochoose which experts to assign each example to based on the relativediscriminative performance of the experts for that example. Using the discriminativeperformance of the experts to determine the learned assignments is muchbetter than simply clustering the input vectors and assigning anexpert to each cluster, but it makes the training hard to parallelize: First, theweighted training set for each expert keeps changing in a way thatdepends on all the other experts and second, the gating network needsto compare the performance of different experts on the same example toknow how to revise its assignment probabilities. These difficultieshave meant that mixtures of experts are rarely used in the regimewhere they might be most beneficial: tasks with huge datasets thatcontain distinctly different subsets."
Why did the authors use a different set of phonemes for decoding and scoring?,"No, the softmax values of different sets of co-hyponyms are not compared","There is no evidential information about using a different set of phonemes for decoding and scoring, this question cannot be answered in this paper. However, since the authors follow the settings from existing works so this could be found in those references.","We closely followed the procedure in [16].

"What considerations would authors need to take to extend this model to languages that have more phonemes than American English? (eg. Indian languages, Chinese, etc)",Yes,"When authors need to take to extend this model to other languages or other datasets than TIMIT corpus, they should extend the phonemes set for some phonemes that are not included in American English.

The authors mentioned that they used an all-zero frame of values to denote the end of sequence.

How did the performance of the proposed model differ on shorter vs longer audio sequences?,False. The paper proposes both sequence-to-sequence models (Deep LSTM Reader) and attention-based models (Impatient and Attentive Readers),"While the proposed model showed good performance on shorter audio sequences (~200 phones), it failed to align most of phones on longer audio sequences.","The first column of Fig. 4 shows the number ofcorrectly aligned frames w.r.t. the utterance length (in frames) for some of theconsidered models.

Even when itfailed, it correctly aligned about 50 phones. On the other hand, the model withthe hybrid attention mechanism with convolutional features was able to alignsequences up to 200 phones long. However, once it began to fail, the model wasnot able to align almost all phones. The model with the smoothing behavedsimilarly to the one with convolutional features only."

Do the authors use any datasets other than TIMIT to gauge the generalizability of their model?,NO,The authors used no dataset other than TIMIT for the evaluation of the model.,"In this paper, we evaluate attention-based models on aphoneme recognition task using the widely-used TIMITdataset. At each time step in generating an output sequence (phonemes),an attention mechanism selects or weighs the signals producedby a trained feature extraction mechanism at potentially all of the time stepsin the input sequence (speech frames). The weighted feature vector thenhelps to condition the generation of the next element of the output sequence.Since the utterances in this dataset are rathershort (mostly under 5 seconds), we measure theability of the considered models in recognizing much longerutterances which were created by artificially concatenatingthe existing utterances."
Authors explain the challenges AI models face when dealing with longer time sequences. Would human performance on this task also decline when analyzing longer sequnces?,"Sure! Based on the context you provided, the answer is:

2 basis components","While the authors explain the issue of dealing with longer time sequences, this question cannot be answered in this paper since there is no evidential information about human performance.","We start with a model proposed in[2] for the machine translation taskas the baseline.

What are ASRGs?,To improve model performance by leveraging both video and image generative modeling objectives,"ARSG is the sequence generator based on the RNN network, which utilizes the attention mechanism.","An attention-based recurrent sequence generator (ARSG) is a recurrent neuralnetwork that stochastically generates an output sequence (y_{1},\dots,y_{T})from an input x. In practice, x is often processed by an encoderwhich outputs a sequential input representation h=(h_{1},\ldots,h_{L}) moresuitable for the attention mechanism to work with."
What is CTC-training?,The paper's approximation is 5 times closer to the minimal perturbation than the competitive approaches,"According to the related work section in the paper, CTC training is the deep-learning-based speech recognization model which performs MAP inference on the alignment as a latent random variable. There is no detailed information on how CTC training works in this paper and presumed to exist in [13].","Speech recognizers based on the connectionist temporal classification (CTC,[13]) and its extension, RNNTransducer [14], are the closest to the ARSG modelconsidered in this paper. They follow earlier work on end-to-end trainable deeplearning over sequences with gradient signals flowing through the alignmentprocess [15]. They have been shown to perform well on thephoneme recognition task [16]. Furthermore, the CTC wasrecently found to be able to directly transcribe text from speech without anyintermediate phonetic representation [17]. The considered ARSG is different from both the CTC and RNN Transducer in twoways. First, whereas the attention mechanism deterministically aligns the inputand the output sequences, the CTC and RNN Transducer treat the alignment as alatent random variable over which MAP (maximum a posteriori) inference isperformed. This deterministic nature of the ARSG’s alignment mechanism allowsbeam search procedure to be simpler. Furthermore, we empirically observe that amuch smaller beam width can be used with the deterministic mechanism, whichallows faster decoding (see Sec. 4.2 andFig. 2).Second, the alignment mechanism of both the CTC and RNN Transducer isconstrained to be “monotonic” to keep marginalization of the alignmenttractable. On the other hand, the proposed attention mechanism can result innon-monotonic alignment, which makes it suitable for a larger variety of tasksother than speech recognition."
"Similar to some of the related work, do the authors also use CTC-training for their proposed model?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Yes.

The fact that the optimal performance was not seen with 100% of the data indicates that the system has strong generalization ability, as it is able to perform well on unseen passages. If the system were to simply memorize the target corpus, it would achieve optimal performance with 100% of the data. However, the fact that the peak performance is achieved with a smaller subset of passages suggests that the system is able to generalize to unseen passages and is not simply memorizing the training data","The authors used attention-based recurrent sequence generator (ARSG) in this paper, which is different from CTC. While CTC based models are close to the proposed ARSG model, it has different characteristics from those models such as how the alignment is treated and whether the model can result in non-monotonic alignment.","Speech recognizers based on the connectionist temporal classification (CTC,[13]) and its extension, RNNTransducer [14], are the closest to the ARSG modelconsidered in this paper.

Explain how phoneme error rate (PER) is calculated?,Yes,While the phoneme error rate PER is used for the evaluation metric in this paper since there is no evidential information on how this metric can be calculated this question cannot be answered and requires external knowledge.,"As TIMIT is a relatively small dataset, proper regularization is crucial.

For one, we present anovel purely neural speech recognition architecture based on an attentionmechanism, whose performance is comparable to that of the conventionalapproaches on the TIMIT dataset. Moreover, we propose a generic method ofadding location awareness to the attention mechanism. Finally, we introduce amodification of the attention mechanism to avoid concentrating the attention ona single frame, and thus avoid obtaining less “effective training examples”,bringing the PER down to 17.6%."
What point in StarGAN is valuable compared to Conditional GAN?,False,"paper's model can process multiple different domains. According to the parer, several different paragraph compares previous researches and their model. However, there is no evidence that, that models are related to conditional GAN.","Conditional GANs. GAN-based conditional image generation has also been actively studied. Prior studies have provided both the discriminator and generator with class information in order to generate samples conditioned on the class  [20, 21, 22]. Other recent approaches focused on generating particular images highly relevant to a given text description  [25, 30]. The idea of conditional image generation has also been successfully applied to domain transfer [9, 28], super-resolution imaging[14], and photo editing [2, 27].In this paper, we propose a scalable GAN framework that can flexibly steer the image translation to various target domains, by providing conditional domain information."
What term do they add in loss function to guarantee that generated images are not differentiable from real images?,"By observing that similar distribution of activation values from SE blocks across different image classes indicates that the blocks are not important, and removing them incurs only a marginal loss in accuracy",Adversarial loss. Paper noted that adversarial loss was adopted in order to make indistinguishable image,"Adversarial Loss. To make the generated images indistinguishable from real images, we adopt an adversarial loss\begin{split}\mathcal{L}_{adv}=&\thinspace{\mathbb{E}}_{x}\left[\log{{D}_{src}(x)}\right]\>\>+\\&\thinspace{\mathbb{E}}_{x,c}[\log{(1-{D}_{src}(G(x,c)))}],\end{split}(1)where G generates an image G(x,c) conditioned on both the input image x and the target domain label c, while D tries to distinguish between real and fake images. In this paper, we refer to the term {D}_{src}(x) as a probability distribution over sources given by D. The generator G tries to minimize this objective, while the discriminator D tries to maximize it. Generative Adversarial Networks. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) [3] have shown remarkable results in various computer vision tasks such as image generation [6, 24, 32, 8], image translation [7, 9, 33], super-resolution imaging [14], and face image synthesis [10, 16, 26, 31]. A typical GAN model consists of two modules: a discriminator and a generator. The discriminator learns to distinguish between real and fake samples, while the generator learns to generate fake samples that are indistinguishable from real samples. Our approach also leverages the adversarial loss to make the generated images as realistic as possible."
What value is assigned to unknown labels?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Normalization is crucial in deep networks to ensure the stability and speed of training, especially when using residual learning. It helps to reduce the internal covariate shift and improve the generalization of the model","zeros. According to paper, authors wrote that they simply assign zero values on unknown labels.","Mask Vector. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a mask vector m that allows StarGAN to ignore unspecified labels and focus on the explicitly known label provided by a particular dataset. In StarGAN, we use an n-dimensional one-hot vector to represent m, with n being the number of datasets. In addition, we define a unified version of the label as a vector\tilde{c}=[{c}_{1},...,{c}_{n},m],(7)where [\cdot] refers to concatenation, and {c}_{i} represents a vector for the labels of the i-th dataset. The vector of the known label {c}_{i} can be represented as either a binary vector for binary attributes or a one-hot vector for categorical attributes. For the remaining n\mathbb{-}1 unknown labels we simply assign zero values. In our experiments, we utilize the CelebA and RaFD datasets, where n is two."
Model architecture of StarGAN is based on two other GAN models. What is it?,Logistic regression with multilabel classification,"The CycleGAN and the PatchGAN. According to the paper, StarGAN was basically generated from CycleGAN. In addition, paper note that discriminator was made by PatchGAN.","Network Architecture.Adapted from CycleGAN [33], StarGAN has the generator network composed of two convolutional layers with the stride size of two for downsampling, six residual blocks [5], and two transposed convolutional layers with the stride size of two for upsampling. We use instance normalization [29] for the generator but no normalization for the discriminator. We leverage PatchGANs [7, 15, 33] for the discriminator network, which classifies whether local image patches are real or fake. See the appendix (Section 7.2) for more details about the network architecture."
They perform only a qualitative analysis of the proposed model. Is it true?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the given context:

The Uniform Reader model is different from the base LSTM model in that it ignores the attention variables",False. They provided not only qualitative analysis but also quantitive analysis for their model.,"Qualitative evaluation. Fig. 4 shows the facial attribute transfer results on CelebA. We observed that our method provides a higher visual quality of translation results on test data compared to the cross-domain models. One possible reason is the regularization effect of StarGAN through a multi-task learning framework. In other words, rather than training a model to perform a fixed translation (e.g., brown-to-blond hair), which is prone to overfitting, we train our model to flexibly translate images according to the labels of the target domain. This allows our model to learn reliable features universally applicable to multiple domains of images with different facial attribute values. Quantitative evaluation protocol. For quantitative evaluations, we performed two user studies in a survey format using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess single and multiple attribute transfer tasks. Given an input image, the Turkers were instructed to choose the best generated image based on perceptual realism, quality of transfer in attribute(s), and preservation of a figure’s original identity. The options were four randomly shuffled images generated from four different methods. The generated images in one study have a single attribute transfer in either hair color (black, blond, brown), gender, or age. In another study, the generated images involve a combination of attribute transfers. Each Turker was asked 30 to 40 questions with a few simple yet logical questions for validating human effort. The number of validated Turkers in each user study is 146 and 100 in single and multiple transfer tasks, respectively. Quantitative results. Tables 1 and 2 show the results of our AMT experiment on single- and multi-attribute transfer tasks, respectively. StarGAN obtained the majority of votes for best transferring attributes in all cases.In the case of gender changes in Table 1, the voting difference between our model and other models was marginal, e.g., 39.1% for StarGAN vs. 31.4% for DIAT. However, in multi-attribute changes, e.g., the ‘G+A’ case in Table 2, the performance difference becomes significant, e.g., 49.8% for StarGAN vs. 20.3% for IcGAN), clearly showing the advantages of StarGAN in more complicated, multi-attribute transfer tasks. This is because unlike the other methods, StarGAN can handle image translation involving multiple attribute changes by randomly generating a target domain label in the training phase. Qualitative evaluation. As seen in Fig. 5, StarGAN clearly generates the most natural-looking expressions while properly maintaining the personal identity and facial features of the input. While DIAT and CycleGAN mostly preserve the identity of the input, many of their results are shown blurry and do not maintain the degree of sharpness as seen in the input. IcGAN even fails to preserve the personal identity in the image by generating male images. Quantitative evaluation. For a quantitative evaluation, we compute the classification error of a facial expression on synthesized images. We trained a facial expression classifier on the RaFD dataset (90%/10% splitting for training and test sets) using a ResNet-18 architecture [5], resulting in a near-perfect accuracy of 99.55%. We then trained each of image translation models using the same training set and performed image translation on the same, unseen test set. Finally, we classified the expression of these translated images using the above-mentioned classifier. As can be seen in Table 3, our model achieves the lowest classification error, indicating that our model produces the most realistic facial expressions among all the methods compared."
How many generators have to be trained if you train the cross-domain model for a 5-domain image translation task using the previous approach?,Multiple layers,"it takes 20 generators in order to do 5-domain image translation task. According to the paper, for k-domain task, k(k-1) generators are necessary.","However, existing models are both inefficient and ineffective in such multi-domain image translation tasks. Their inefficiency results from the fact that in order to learn all mappings among k domains, k(k\mathbb{-}1) generators have to be trained. Fig. 2 (a) illustrates how twelve distinct generator networks have to be trained to translate images among four different domains. Meanwhile, they are ineffective that even though there exist global features that can be learned from images of all domains such as face shapes, each generator cannot fully utilize the entire training data and only can learn from two domains out of k. Failure to fully utilize training data is likely to limit the quality of generated images. Furthermore, they are incapable of jointly training domains from different datasets because each dataset is partially labeled, which we further discuss in Section 3.2."
How many terms are used for the loss function of a generator?,The NetVLAD pooling layer can be inserted into any other CNN architecture. It is a generic building block that can be easily integrated into existing architectures,"it takes three. According to the equation, we can think that G means generator.","Full Objective. Finally, the objective functions to optimize G and D are written, respectively, as\mathcal{L}_{D}=-\mathcal{L}_{adv}+{\lambda}_{cls}\thinspace\mathcal{L}_{cls}^{r},(5)\mathcal{L}_{G}=\mathcal{L}_{adv}+{\lambda}_{cls}\thinspace\mathcal{L}_{cls}^{f}+{\lambda}_{rec}\thinspace\mathcal{L}_{rec},(6)where {\lambda}_{cls} and {\lambda}_{rec} are hyper-parameters that control the relative importance of domain classification and reconstruction losses, respectively, compared to the adversarial loss. We use {\lambda}_{cls}=1 and {\lambda}_{rec}=10 in all of our experiments."
What does “AMT” mean?,Mixture of expert gating functions are designed using a gating network that computes the probability of assigning each example to each expert based on their relative discriminative performance,AMT means Amazon Mechanical Turk.,"Quantitative evaluation protocol.

What is an example attribute used in experiment of joint training?,"KG-Classifier works as a query in the attention-like mechanism, using the hidden representation h^{l}_{KGC} of the KG-Classifier adapter to substitute Q^{l} in the equation",We can't know from given paragraphs.,"Several image datasets come with a number of labeled attributes. For instance, the CelebA[19] dataset contains 40 labels related to facial attributes such as hair color, gender, and age, and the RaFD [13] dataset has 8 labels for facial expressions such as ‘happy’, ‘angry’ and ‘sad’. These settings enable us to perform more interesting tasks, namely multi-domain image-to-image translation, where we change images according to attributes from multiple domains. The first five columns in Fig. StarGAN: Unified Generative Adversarial Networks  for Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation show how a CelebA image can be translated according to any of the four domains, ‘blond hair’, ‘gender’, ‘aged’, and ‘pale skin’. We can further extend to training multiple domains from different datasets, such as jointly training CelebA and RaFD images to change a CelebA image’s facial expression using features learned by training on RaFD, as in the rightmost columns of Fig. StarGAN: Unified Generative Adversarial Networks  for Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation.  Effects of joint training. Fig. 6 shows qualitative comparisons between StarGAN-SNG and StarGAN-JNT, where the task is to synthesize facial expressions of images in CelebA. StarGAN-JNT exhibits emotional expressions with high visual quality, while StarGAN-SNG generates reasonable but blurry images with gray backgrounds. This difference is due to the fact that StarGAN-JNT learns to translate CelebA images during training but not StarGAN-SNG. In other words, StarGAN-JNT can leverage both datasets to improve shared low-level tasks such facial keypoint detection and segmentation. By utilizing both CelebA and RaFD, StarGAN-JNT can improve these low-level tasks, which is beneficial to learning facial expression synthesis."
How do they train a single-generator to learn a variety in translating images?,"DDIM stands for Diffusion-based Dual-Image Model, and a closed-form manner refers to a mathematical expression that can be evaluated in a straightforward and analytical way, without the need for numerical optimization or approximation","By randomly generated domain label, model can practice multiple domain.","Our goal is to train a single generator G that learns mappings among multiple domains. To achieve this, we train G to translate an input image x into an output image y conditioned on the target domain label c, G(x,c)\rightarrow y.We randomly generate the target domain label c so that G learns to flexibly translate the input image. We also introduce an auxiliary classifier [22] that allows a single discriminator to control multiple domains. That is, our discriminator produces probability distributions over both sources and domain labels, D:x\rightarrow\{{D}_{src}(x),{D}_{cls}(x)\}. Fig. 3 illustrates the training process of our proposed approach."
What problem can occur when you train a generator only with an adversarial loss and a domain classification loss?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Five question-answering benchmarks for commonsense","When loss function does not contains reconstruction loss, minimizing the losses does not guarantee that translated images preserve the content of its input images while changing only the domain-related part of the inputs.","Reconstruction Loss. By minimizing the adversarial and classification losses, G is trained to generate images that are realistic and classified to its correct target domain. However, minimizing the losses (Eqs. (1) and (3)) does not guarantee that translated images preserve the content of its input images while changing only the domain-related part of the inputs. To alleviate this problem, we apply a cycle consistency loss [9, 33] to the generator, defined as\mathcal{L}_{rec}={\mathbb{E}}_{x,c,c^{\prime}}[{||x-G(G(x,c),c^{\prime})||}_{1}],(4)where G takes in the translated image G(x,c) and the original domain label c^{\prime} as input and tries to reconstruct the original image x. We adopt the L1 norm as our reconstruction loss. Note that we use a single generator twice, first to translate an original image into an image in the target domain and then to reconstruct the original image from the translated image."
"Why do they divide domain classification loss in two terms for real image and fake image, respectively?","Pix2pix and CycleGAN are both image-to-image translation methods, but they differ in their training approach. Pix2pix uses paired training examples, while CycleGAN uses unpaired examples","to translate x into an output image y, which is properly classified to the target domain c, authors divided classification loss in two terms.","Domain Classification Loss. For a given input image x and a target domain label c, our goal is to translate x into an output image y, which is properly classified to the target domain c. To achieve this condition, we add an auxiliary classifier on top of D and impose the domain classification loss when optimizing both D and G. That is, we decompose the objective into two terms: a domain classification loss of real images used to optimize D, and a domain classification loss of fake images used to optimize G. In detail, the former is defined as\mathcal{L}_{cls}^{r}={\mathbb{E}}_{x,c^{\prime}}[-\log{{D}_{cls}(c^{\prime}|x)}],(2)where the term {D}_{cls}(c^{\prime}|x) represents a probability distribution over domain labels computed by D. By minimizing this objective, D learns to classify a real image x to its corresponding original domain c^{\prime}. We assume that the input image and domain label pair (x,c^{\prime}) is given by the training data. On the other hand, the loss function for the domain classification of fake images is defined as\mathcal{L}_{cls}^{f}={\mathbb{E}}_{x,c}[-\log{{D}_{cls}(c|G(x,c))}].(3)In other words, G tries to minimize this objective to generate images that can be classified as the target domain c. "
How do they make StarGAN to ignore unspecified labels?,The authors chose a greedy approach for the general classifier because it is computationally efficient and yields small perturbations that are believed to be good approximations of the minimal perturbation,"By using mask vector, StarGAN was allowed to ignore unspecified labels.","Mask Vector. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a mask vector m that allows StarGAN to ignore unspecified labels and focus on the explicitly known label provided by a particular dataset. In StarGAN, we use an n-dimensional one-hot vector to represent m, with n being the number of datasets. In addition, we define a unified version of the label as a vector\tilde{c}=[{c}_{1},...,{c}_{n},m],(7)where [\cdot] refers to concatenation, and {c}_{i} represents a vector for the labels of the i-th dataset. The vector of the known label {c}_{i} can be represented as either a binary vector for binary attributes or a one-hot vector for categorical attributes. For the remaining n\mathbb{-}1 unknown labels we simply assign zero values. In our experiments, we utilize the CelebA and RaFD datasets, where n is two. Training Strategy. When training StarGAN with multiple datasets, we use the domain label \tilde{c} defined in Eq. (7) as input to the generator. By doing so, the generator learns to ignore the unspecified labels, which are zero vectors, and focus on the explicitly given label. The structure of the generator is exactly the same as in training with a single dataset, except for the dimension of the input label \tilde{c}. On the other hand, we extend the auxiliary classifier of the discriminator to generate probability distributions over labels for all datasets. Then, we train the model in a multi-task learning setting, where the discriminator tries to minimize only the classification error associated to the known label. For example, when training with images in CelebA, the discriminator minimizes only classification errors for labels related to CelebA attributes, and not facial expressions related to RaFD. Under these settings, by alternating between CelebA and RaFD the discriminator learns all of the discriminative features for both datasets, and the generator learns to control all the labels in both datasets."
How do they show the importance of mask vectors?,"The authors computed the contributions of the pixels using the absolute value of the elementwise product of the gradient and the input, and then used a threshold-based approach to clip pixels with smaller contributions","In order to ignore unspecified vectors and link different domains, mask vectors are necessray.","Mask Vector. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a mask vector m that allows StarGAN to ignore unspecified labels and focus on the explicitly known label provided by a particular dataset. In StarGAN, we use an n-dimensional one-hot vector to represent m, with n being the number of datasets. In addition, we define a unified version of the label as a vector\tilde{c}=[{c}_{1},...,{c}_{n},m],(7)where [\cdot] refers to concatenation, and {c}_{i} represents a vector for the labels of the i-th dataset.

For the remaining n\mathbb{-}1 unknown labels we simply assign zero values. In our experiments, we utilize the CelebA and RaFD datasets, where n is two. Learned role of mask vector. In this experiment, we gave a one-hot vector c by setting the dimension of a particular facial expression (available from the second dataset, RaFD) to one. In this case, since the label associated with the second data set is explicitly given, the proper mask vector would be [0,1]. Fig. 7 shows the case where this proper mask vector was given and the opposite case where a wrong mask vector of [1,0] was given.When the wrong mask vector was used, StarGAN-JNT fails to synthesize facial expressions, and it manipulates the age of the input image. This is because the model ignores the facial expression label as unknown and treats the facial attribute label as valid by the mask vector. Note that since one of the facial attributes is ‘young’, the model translates the image from young to old when it takes in a zero vector as input. From this behavior, we can confirm that StarGAN properly learned the intended role of a mask vector in image-to-image translations when involving all the labels from multiple datasets altogether. In this paper, we proposed StarGAN, a scalable image-to-image translation model among multiple domains using a single generator and a discriminator. Besides the advantages in scalability, StarGAN generated images of higher visual quality compared to existing methods [16, 23, 33], owing to the generalization capability behind the multi-task learning setting. In addition, the use of the proposed simple mask vector enables StarGAN to utilize multiple datasets with different sets of domain labels, thus handling all available labels from them. We hope our work to enable users to develop interesting image translation applications across multiple domains.  We also introduce a simple but effective approach that enables joint training between domains of different datasets by adding a mask vector to the domain label. Our proposed method ensures that the model can ignore unknown labels and focus on the label provided by a particular dataset. In this manner, our model can perform well on tasks such as synthesizing facial expressions of CelebA images using features learned from RaFD, as shown in the rightmost columns of Fig. StarGAN: Unified Generative Adversarial Networks  for Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation. As far as our knowledge goes, our work is the first to successfully perform multi-domain image translation across different datasets. Overall, our contributions are as follows:\bulletWe propose StarGAN, a novel generative adversarial network that learns the mappings among multiple domains using only a single generator and a discriminator, training effectively from images of all domains.\bulletWe demonstrate how we can successfully learn multi-domain image translation between multiple datasets by utilizing a mask vector method that enables StarGAN to control all available domain labels.\bulletWe provide both qualitative and quantitative results on facial attribute transfer and facial expression synthesis tasks using StarGAN, showing its superiority over baseline models."
They propose StarGAN to overcome a limitation of high computational complexity of current image-to-image translation models. Is it true?,"The proposed loss function includes a target latency term, which is not present in the original Single-Path NAS loss function","It is false. There is no evidence that the motivation of StarGAN was made in order to overcome a limitation of high computational complexity, even it achieved that.","Another important advantage of our model is the scalability in terms of the number of parameters required. The last column in Table 3 shows that the number of parameters required to learn all translations by StarGAN is seven times smaller than that of DIAT and fourteen times smaller than that of CycleGAN. This is because StarGAN requires only a single generator and discriminator pair, regardless of the number of domains, while in the case of cross-domain models such as CycleGAN, a completely different model should be trained for each source-target domain pair."
How many benchmark dataset are used to evaluate the proposed model?,"C2Q (Context-to-Query) attention focuses on which query words are most relevant to each context word, while Q2C (Query-to-Context) attention focuses on which context words have the closest similarity to one of the query words",Three benchmark datasets are used.,"We utilize three standard citation network benchmark datasets—Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed (Sen et al., 2008)—and closely follow the transductive experimental setup of Yang et al. (2016). In all of these datasets, nodes correspond to documents and edges to (undirected) citations. Node features correspond to elements of a bag-of-words representation of a document. Each node has a class label. We allow for only 20 nodes per class to be used for training—however, honoring the transductive setup, the training algorithm has access to all of the nodes’ feature vectors. The predictive power of the trained models is evaluated on 1000 test nodes, and we use 500 additional nodes for validation purposes (the same ones as used by Kipf & Welling (2017)). The Cora dataset contains 2708 nodes, 5429 edges, 7 classes and 1433 features per node. The Citeseer dataset contains 3327 nodes, 4732 edges, 6 classes and 3703 features per node. The Pubmed dataset contains 19717 nodes, 44338 edges, 3 classes and 500 features per node."
It is not necessary to know the graph structure when using the proposed method. Is it true?,"No.

While the study you provided achieved high accuracy rates, the small dataset size (150 images) and lack of diversity in the data may lead to overfitting and reduced generalization performance on unseen data. Additionally, the study did not address data balancing between classes, which is crucial for high accuracy in imbalanced datasets. Therefore, it is unlikely that a CNN model trained on such a limited dataset would be able to achieve very high accuracy in real-world scenarios",It is true.,"We have presented graph attention networks (GATs), novel convolution-style neural networks that operate on graph-structured data, leveraging masked self-attentional layers. The graph attentional layer utilized throughout these networks is computationally efficient (does not require costly matrix operations, and is parallelizable across all nodes in the graph), allows for (implicitly) assigning different importances to different nodes within a neighborhood while dealing with different sized neighborhoods, and does not depend on knowing the entire graph structure upfront—thus addressing many of the theoretical issues with previous spectral-based approaches. Our models leveraging attention have successfully achieved or matched state-of-the-art performance across four well-established node classification benchmarks, both transductive and inductive (especially, with completely unseen graphs used for testing)."
What does “attention coefficient” mean?,The proposed approach outperforms CoVE by 43.9% on IMDb and 22% on TREC-6,"Normalized attention coefficient is a coefficient that is used for compute linear combination of the futures. However, there is no explanation about simple ""attention coefficient"".","Once obtained, the normalized attention coefficients are used to compute a linear combination of the features corresponding to them, to serve as the final output features for every node (after potentially applying a nonlinearity, \sigma):\vec{h}^{\prime}_{i}=\sigma\left(\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}_{i}}\alpha_{ij}{\bf W}\vec{h}_{j}\right).(4)"
What point is different in GATs in terms of assigning weight compared to GCN?,8.5 MBytes (68 Mbits) of on-chip memory,GATs uses implicit weight assigning while GCN doesn't.,"The graph attentional layer described in subsection 2.1 directly addresses several issues that were present in prior approaches to modelling graph-structured data with neural networks:•Computationally, it is highly efficient: the operation of the self-attentional layer can be parallelized across all edges, and the computation of output features can be parallelized across all nodes. No eigendecompositions or similar costly matrix operations are required. The time complexity of a single GAT attention head computing F^{\prime} features may be expressed as O(|V|FF^{\prime}+|E|F^{\prime}), where F is the number of input features, and |V| and |E| are the numbers of nodes and edges in the graph, respectively. This complexity is on par with the baseline methods such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2017). Applying multi-head attention multiplies the storage and parameter requirements by a factor of K, while the individual heads’ computations are fully independent and can be parallelized.•As opposed to GCNs, our model allows for (implicitly) assigning different importances to nodes of a same neighborhood, enabling a leap in model capacity. Furthermore, analyzing the learned attentional weights may lead to benefits in interpretability, as was the case in the machine translation domain (e.g. the qualitative analysis of Bahdanau et al. (2015)).•The attention mechanism is applied in a shared manner to all edges in the graph, and therefore it does not depend on upfront access to the global graph structure or (features of) all of its nodes (a limitation of many prior techniques). This has several desirable implications:–The graph is not required to be undirected (we may simply leave out computing \alpha_{ij} if edge j\rightarrow i is not present).–It makes our technique directly applicable to inductive learning—including tasks where the model is evaluated on graphs that are completely unseen during training.•The recently published inductive method of Hamilton et al. (2017) samples a fixed-size neighborhood of each node, in order to keep its computational footprint consistent; this does not allow it access to the entirety of the neighborhood while performing inference. Moreover, this technique achieved some of its strongest results when an LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)-based neighborhood aggregator is used. This assumes the existence of a consistent sequential node ordering across neighborhoods, and the authors have rectified it by consistently feeding randomly-ordered sequences to the LSTM. Our technique does not suffer from either of these issues—it works with the entirety of the neighborhood (at the expense of a variable computational footprint, which is still on-par with methods like the GCN), and does not assume any ordering within it.•As mentioned in Section 1, GAT can be reformulated as a particular instance of MoNet (Monti et al., 2016). More specifically, setting the pseudo-coordinate function to be u(x,y)=f(x)\|f(y), where f(x) represent (potentially MLP-transformed) features of node x and \| is concatenation; and the weight function to be w_{j}(u)=\mathrm{softmax}(\mathrm{MLP}(u)) (with the softmax performed over the entire neighborhood of a node) would make MoNet’s patch operator similar to ours. Nevertheless, one should note that, in comparison to previously considered MoNet instances, our model uses node features for similarity computations, rather than the node’s structural properties (which would assume knowing the graph structure upfront). We were able to produce a version of the GAT layer that leverages sparse matrix operations, reducing the storage complexity to linear in the number of nodes and edges and enabling the execution of GAT models on larger graph datasets. However, the tensor manipulation framework we used only supports sparse matrix multiplication for rank-2 tensors, which limits the batching capabilities of the layer as it is currently implemented (especially for datasets with multiple graphs). Appropriately addressing this constraint is an important direction for future work. Depending on the regularity of the graph structure in place, GPUs may not be able to offer major performance benefits compared to CPUs in these sparse scenarios. It should also be noted that the size of the “receptive field” of our model is upper-bounded by the depth of the network (similarly as for GCN and similar models). Techniques such as skip connections (He et al., 2016) could be readily applied for appropriately extending the depth, however. Lastly, parallelization across all the graph edges, especially in a distributed manner, may involve a lot of redundant computation, as the neighborhoods will often highly overlap in graphs of interest. For the inductive learning task, we apply a three-layer GAT model. Both of the first two layers consist of K=4 attention heads computing F^{\prime}=256 features (for a total of 1024 features), followed by an ELU nonlinearity. The final layer is used for (multi-label) classification: K=6 attention heads computing 121 features each, that are averaged and followed by a logistic sigmoid activation. The training sets for this task are sufficiently large and we found no need to apply L_{2} regularization or dropout—we have, however, successfully employed skip connections (He et al., 2016) across the intermediate attentional layer. We utilize a batch size of 2 graphs during training. To strictly evaluate the benefits of applying an attention mechanism in this setting (i.e. comparing with a near GCN-equivalent model), we also provide the results when a constant attention mechanism, a(x,y)=1, is used, with the same architecture—this will assign the same weight to every neighbor."
Which benchmark dataset used in this paper has the largest data size?,To reduce the number of parameters in the model,"It is hard to say a single benchmark set has largest size, because size definition is not given.

The Pubmed dataset contains 19717 nodes, 44338 edges, 3 classes and 500 features per node."
How do they solve the problem that the risk of the training process of self-attention could be unstable using multi-head attention?,To facilitate transfer learning from CNN models trained on ImageNet,"to make self-attention stable, they used different mechanism which uses multi-head attention, similar to Vaswani et al.'s one.","To stabilize the learning process of self-attention, we have found extending our mechanism to employ multi-head attention to be beneficial, similarly to Vaswani et al. (2017). Specifically, K independent attention mechanisms execute the transformation of Equation 4, and then their features are concatenated, resulting in the following output feature representation:\vec{h}^{\prime}_{i}=\operatorname*{\scalebox{1.0}[1.5]{$\parallel$}}_{k=1}^{K}\sigma\left(\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}_{i}}\alpha_{ij}^{k}{\bf W}^{k}\vec{h}_{j}\right)(5)where \parallel represents concatenation, \alpha_{ij}^{k} are normalized attention coefficients computed by the k-th attention mechanism (a^{k}), and {\bf W}^{k} is the corresponding input linear transformation’s weight matrix. Note that, in this setting, the final returned output, {\bf h}^{\prime}, will consist of KF^{\prime} features (rather than F^{\prime}) for each node."
How can it actually benefit that GAT can learn regardless of the graph structure?,"Smooth feature regularization refers to the regularization term \mathcal{L}_{R} in the VAE objective, which encourages the learned latent space to be smooth and structured, rather than allowing it to become too complex or high-dimensional. This helps the model learn more generalizable features and improves its performance on downstream tasks",There are no clue to find what graph can GAT process by its regardless of the graph structure.,"We have presented graph attention networks (GATs), novel convolution-style neural networks that operate on graph-structured data, leveraging masked self-attentional layers. The graph attentional layer utilized throughout these networks is computationally efficient (does not require costly matrix operations, and is parallelizable across all nodes in the graph), allows for (implicitly) assigning different importances to different nodes within a neighborhood while dealing with different sized neighborhoods, and does not depend on knowing the entire graph structure upfront—thus addressing many of the theoretical issues with previous spectral-based approaches. Our models leveraging attention have successfully achieved or matched state-of-the-art performance across four well-established node classification benchmarks, both transductive and inductive (especially, with completely unseen graphs used for testing)."
How can the GATs work well without any assumption of node order?,"The authors claim that their proposed model is ""sample efficient"" because it achieves high performance with a small number of labeled examples, outperforming highly engineered models and transfer learning approaches on six text classification tasks","GATs work with the entirety of the neighborhood, like GCN did. This is the main difference with LSTM method and the reason why GATs work well without any assumption of node order.","The graph attentional layer described in subsection 2.1 directly addresses several issues that were present in prior approaches to modelling graph-structured data with neural networks:•Computationally, it is highly efficient: the operation of the self-attentional layer can be parallelized across all edges, and the computation of output features can be parallelized across all nodes. No eigendecompositions or similar costly matrix operations are required. The time complexity of a single GAT attention head computing F^{\prime} features may be expressed as O(|V|FF^{\prime}+|E|F^{\prime}), where F is the number of input features, and |V| and |E| are the numbers of nodes and edges in the graph, respectively. This complexity is on par with the baseline methods such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2017). Applying multi-head attention multiplies the storage and parameter requirements by a factor of K, while the individual heads’ computations are fully independent and can be parallelized.•As opposed to GCNs, our model allows for (implicitly) assigning different importances to nodes of a same neighborhood, enabling a leap in model capacity. Furthermore, analyzing the learned attentional weights may lead to benefits in interpretability, as was the case in the machine translation domain (e.g. the qualitative analysis of Bahdanau et al. (2015)).•The attention mechanism is applied in a shared manner to all edges in the graph, and therefore it does not depend on upfront access to the global graph structure or (features of) all of its nodes (a limitation of many prior techniques). This has several desirable implications:–The graph is not required to be undirected (we may simply leave out computing \alpha_{ij} if edge j\rightarrow i is not present).–It makes our technique directly applicable to inductive learning—including tasks where the model is evaluated on graphs that are completely unseen during training.•The recently published inductive method of Hamilton et al. (2017) samples a fixed-size neighborhood of each node, in order to keep its computational footprint consistent; this does not allow it access to the entirety of the neighborhood while performing inference. Moreover, this technique achieved some of its strongest results when an LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)-based neighborhood aggregator is used. This assumes the existence of a consistent sequential node ordering across neighborhoods, and the authors have rectified it by consistently feeding randomly-ordered sequences to the LSTM. Our technique does not suffer from either of these issues—it works with the entirety of the neighborhood (at the expense of a variable computational footprint, which is still on-par with methods like the GCN), and does not assume any ordering within it.•As mentioned in Section 1, GAT can be reformulated as a particular instance of MoNet (Monti et al., 2016). More specifically, setting the pseudo-coordinate function to be u(x,y)=f(x)\|f(y), where f(x) represent (potentially MLP-transformed) features of node x and \| is concatenation; and the weight function to be w_{j}(u)=\mathrm{softmax}(\mathrm{MLP}(u)) (with the softmax performed over the entire neighborhood of a node) would make MoNet’s patch operator similar to ours. Nevertheless, one should note that, in comparison to previously considered MoNet instances, our model uses node features for similarity computations, rather than the node’s structural properties (which would assume knowing the graph structure upfront). We were able to produce a version of the GAT layer that leverages sparse matrix operations, reducing the storage complexity to linear in the number of nodes and edges and enabling the execution of GAT models on larger graph datasets. However, the tensor manipulation framework we used only supports sparse matrix multiplication for rank-2 tensors, which limits the batching capabilities of the layer as it is currently implemented (especially for datasets with multiple graphs). Appropriately addressing this constraint is an important direction for future work. Depending on the regularity of the graph structure in place, GPUs may not be able to offer major performance benefits compared to CPUs in these sparse scenarios. It should also be noted that the size of the “receptive field” of our model is upper-bounded by the depth of the network (similarly as for GCN and similar models). Techniques such as skip connections (He et al., 2016) could be readily applied for appropriately extending the depth, however. Lastly, parallelization across all the graph edges, especially in a distributed manner, may involve a lot of redundant computation, as the neighborhoods will often highly overlap in graphs of interest."
How performing a self-attention mechanism to graph can be useful in node classification?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

To demonstrate the generalization of the residual attention network (RAN) to different basic units, the authors performed experiments on various network structures, including ResNeXt and Inception. By showing that the RAN achieves competitive performance on different networks, the authors demonstrate the versatility and generality of their approach","By using self-attention mechanism, model can find hidden meanings in the graph and it helps to do node classification.","Inspired by this recent work, we introduce an attention-based architecture to perform node classification of graph-structured data. The idea is to compute the hidden representations of each node in the graph, by attending over its neighbors, following a self-attention strategy. The attention architecture has several interesting properties: (1) the operation is efficient, since it is parallelizable across node-neighbor pairs; (2) it can be applied to graph nodes having different degrees by specifying arbitrary weights to the neighbors; and (3) the model is directly applicable to inductive learning problems, including tasks where the model has to generalize to completely unseen graphs. We validate the proposed approach on four challenging benchmarks: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation networks as well as an inductive protein-protein interaction dataset, achieving or matching state-of-the-art results that highlight the potential of attention-based models when dealing with arbitrarily structured graphs."
Why was Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) proposed before even if Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) have been successful in many tasks?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Inductive bias refers to the preconceptions and assumptions that a machine learning model makes about the structure of the data it is trained on","Because CNN can process only grid-like structure, GNN, which can process general graph structure proposed.","Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to tackle problems such as image classification (He et al., 2016), semantic segmentation (Jégou et al., 2017) or machine translation (Gehring et al., 2016), where the underlying data representation has a grid-like structure. These architectures efficiently reuse their local filters, with learnable parameters, by applying them to all the input positions. There have been several attempts in the literature to extend neural networks to deal with arbitrarily structured graphs. Early work used recursive neural networks to process data represented in graph domains as directed acyclic graphs (Frasconi et al., 1998; Sperduti & Starita, 1997). Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) were introduced in Gori et al. (2005) and Scarselli et al. (2009) as a generalization of recursive neural networks that can directly deal with a more general class of graphs, e.g. cyclic, directed and undirected graphs. GNNs consist of an iterative process, which propagates the node states until equilibrium; followed by a neural network, which produces an output for each node based on its state. This idea was adopted and improved by Li et al. (2016), which propose to use gated recurrent units (Cho et al., 2014) in the propagation step."
What does “patchwise training” mean?,"Yes. YOLO is highly generalizable and performs well in new, unseen data",there is no clue to define what does patchwise train mean.,"This method is efficient, both asymptotically and absolutely, and precludes the need for the complications in other works.Patchwise training is common [27, 2, 8, 28, 11], but lacks the efficiency of fully convolutional training.Our approach does not make use of pre- and post-processing complications, including superpixels [8, 16], proposals [16, 14], or post-hoc refinement by random fields or local classifiers [8, 16].Our model transfers recent success in classification [19, 31, 32] to dense prediction by reinterpreting classification nets as fully convolutional and fine-tuning from their learned representations.In contrast, previous works have applied small convnets without supervised pre-training [8, 28, 27]. In stochastic optimization, gradient computation is driven by the training distribution.Both patchwise training and fully-convolutional training can be made to produce any distribution, although their relative computational efficiency depends on overlap and minibatch size.Whole image fully convolutional training is identical to patchwise training where each batch consists of all the receptive fields of the units below the loss for an image (or collection of images).While this is more efficient than uniform sampling of patches, it reduces the number of possible batches.However, random selection of patches within an image may be recovered simply.Restricting the loss to a randomly sampled subset of its spatial terms (or, equivalently applying a DropConnect mask [36] between the output and the loss) excludes patches from the gradient computation."
How fast is the proposed method compared to the naive approach?,"Inductive learning involves training a model on a new task using a pre-trained model, while transductive learning involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a new task. In other words, inductive learning involves learning a new task from scratch, while transductive learning involves adapting a pre-trained model to a new task",Proposed method is five times faster than the naive approach.,"Furthermore, while the resulting maps are equivalent to the evaluation of the original net on particular input patches, the computation is highly amortized over the overlapping regions of those patches.For example, while AlexNet takes 1.2 ms (on a typical GPU) to produce the classification scores of a 227\times 227 image, the fully convolutional version takes 22 ms to produce a 10\times 10 grid of outputs from a 500\times 500 image, which is more than 5 times faster than the naïve approach111Assuming efficient batching of single image inputs.The classification scores for a single image by itself take 5.4 ms to produce, which is nearly 25 times slower than the fully convolutional version.."
What does “receptive fields” mean?,"T5-XXL.

The reason is that the text-to-image diffusion model used in the context is conditioned on the embedding produced by the T5-XXL language model, which is a pre-trained language model that generates embeddings of a tokenized text prompt. The use of T5-XXL for vocabulary encoding is important for semantic fidelity and visual quality in the text-to-image diffusion process",receptive fields mean the higher layer which is connected to the original layer.,"Each layer of data in a convnet is a three-dimensional array of size h\times w\times d, where h and w are spatial dimensions, and d is the feature or channel dimension.The first layer is the image, with pixel size h\times w, and d color channels.Locations in higher layers correspond to the locations in the image they are path-connected to, which are called their receptive fields."
What is the expectation of training FCNs end-to-end for pixelwise prediction and from supervised pre-training?,"The evolution of network architectures in deep face recognition systems, from AlexNet to ResNet and SENet, has significantly improved the performance of these systems. The use of deeper and more complex networks, along with advanced training techniques, has led to a dramatic increase in accuracy, from 97.35% in 2014 to over 99.80% in recent years",They expect that FCN exceeds the state-of-the-art without further machinery,"We show that a fully convolutional network (FCN), trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels on semantic segmentation exceeds the state-of-the-art without further machinery.To our knowledge, this is the first work to train FCNs end-to-end (1) for pixelwise prediction and (2) from supervised pre-training.Fully convolutional versions of existing networks predict dense outputs from arbitrary-sized inputs.Both learning and inference are performed whole-image-at-a-time by dense feedforward computation and backpropagation.In-network upsampling layers enable pixelwise prediction and learning in nets with subsampled pooling."
How do they utilize fully-connected layers on dense prediction of image?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

MobileNet with depthwise separable convolutions has only 1% less accuracy than a model built with full convolutions on the ImageNet dataset, but it saves tremendously on mult-adds and parameters",they used in-network upsampling.,"Dense prediction with convnets Several recent works have applied convnets to dense prediction problems,including semantic segmentation by Ning et al. [27], Farabet et al. [8], and Pinheiro and Collobert [28];boundary prediction for electron microscopy by Ciresan et al. [2] and for natural images by a hybrid neural net/nearest neighbor model by Ganin and Lempitsky [11];and image restoration and depth estimation by Eigen et al. [5, 6].Common elements of these approaches include•small models restricting capacity and receptive fields;•patchwise training [27, 2, 8, 28, 11];•post-processing by superpixel projection, random field regularization, filtering, or local classification [8, 2, 11];•input shifting and output interlacing for dense output [28, 11] as introduced by OverFeat [29];•multi-scale pyramid processing [8, 28, 11];•saturating \tanh nonlinearities [8, 5, 28]; and•ensembles [2, 11],whereas our method does without this machinery. However, we do study patchwise training 3.4 and “shift-and-stitch” dense output 3.2 from the perspective of FCNs.We also discuss in-network upsampling 3.3, of which the fully connected prediction by Eigen et al. [6] is a special case. In our experiments, we find that in-network upsampling is fast and effective for learning dense prediction.Our best segmentation architecture uses these layers to learn to upsample for refined prediction in Section 4.2."
Using filters allows us to see finer information. Is there any risk of using filters? Why?,"No, making higher resolution does not have to be incorporated into the network. Instead, it can be done as a separate process using spatial upsampling, as described in the paper",Might get smaller receptive fields and take longer time to compute.,"Simply decreasing subsampling within a net is a tradeoff: the filters see finer information, but have smaller receptive fields and take longer to compute.We have seen that the shift-and-stitch trick is another kind of tradeoff: the output is made denser without decreasing the receptive field sizes of the filters, but the filters are prohibited from accessing information at a finer scale than their original design."
They achieved state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. Is it true?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

Gradient clipping is a technique used in training recurrent neural networks to limit the magnitude of gradients during optimization, helping to prevent exploding gradients and improve training stability",It is true.,"Fine-tuning from classification to segmentation gave reasonable predictions for each net.Even the worst model achieved \sim 75\% of state-of-the-art performance.The segmentation-equippped VGG net (FCN-VGG16) already appears to be state-of-the-art at 56.0 mean IU on val, compared to 52.6 on test [16].Training on extra data raises performance to 59.4 mean IU on a subset of val77footnotemark: 7.Training details are given in Section 4.3. SIFT Flow is a dataset of 2,688 images with pixel labels for 33 semantic categories (“bridge”, “mountain”, “sun”), as well as three geometric categories (“horizontal”, “vertical”, and “sky”).An FCN can naturally learn a joint representation that simultaneously predicts both types of labels.We learn a two-headed version of FCN-16s with semantic and geometric prediction layers and losses.The learned model performs as well on both tasks as two independently trained models, while learning and inference are essentially as fast as each independent model by itself.The results in Table 5, computed on the standard split into 2,488 training and 200 test images,101010Three of the SIFT Flow categories are not present in the test set.We made predictions across all 33 categories, but only included categories actually present in the test set in our evaluation.(An earlier version of this paper reported a lower mean IU, which included all categories either present or predicted in the evaluation.)show state-of-the-art performance on both tasks."
What is the evaluation metric to evaluate a semantic segmentation model?,Smoothing helps count-based language models account for unseen sequences by estimating the probability of rare or out-of-vocabulary sequences,"Pixel accuracy, mean accuracy, mean IU and frequency weighted IU are answers.","Metrics We report four metrics from common semantic segmentation and scene parsing evaluations that are variations on pixel accuracy and region intersection over union (IU).Let n_{ij} be the number of pixels of class i predicted to belong to class j, where there are n_{\text{cl}} different classes, and let t_{i}=\sum_{j}n_{ij} be the total number of pixels of class i. We compute:•pixel accuracy: \sum_{i}n_{ii}/\sum_{i}t_{i} •mean accuraccy: (1/n_{\text{cl}})\sum_{i}n_{ii}/t_{i} •mean IU: (1/n_{\text{cl}})\sum_{i}n_{ii}/\left(t_{i}+\sum_{j}n_{ji}-n_{ii}\right) •frequency weighted IU: \left(\sum_{k}t_{k}\right)^{-1}\sum_{i}t_{i}n_{ii}/\left(t_{i}+\sum_{j}n_{ji}-n_{ii}\right) "
How do Projected Attention Layers work?,"Selective pooling in the position-sensitive RoI layer enables the network to learn specialized position-sensitive score maps, which improves object detection performance","Projected Attention Layers (PAL) takes the hidden state from the previous layer and runs parallel to the self-attention layer. In each PAL, the hidden size of the pretrained layer is linearly projected and then passed through its own self-attention layer before undergoing transformation back to the original hidden state size.","We then experiment with injecting the patterns back into the pre-trained transformer encoder.In particular, we injectthem through additional attention heads in the form of a Projected Attention Layer (PAL) (Stickland and Murray, 2019), along with the parameters of the original model. Details regarding PALs are described in Appendix A."
"What does ""injecting"" information into attention layers mean?","The cycle consistency loss is a loss function that encourages the translation to be ""cycle consistent"", meaning that the translation should be able to bring the input back to the original input, and the inverse translation should also be able to bring the output back to the original output. It is defined as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{cyc}}(G,F) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{\text{data}}(x)}[\lVert F(G(x))-x\rVert_{1}] + \mathbb{E}_{y\sim p_{\text{data}}(y)}[\lVert G(F(y))-y\rVert_{1}]$$

where $G$ and $F$ are the two translation networks, and $p_{\text{data}}(x)$ is the data distribution","Pattern injection means pre-determining the weights of the transformer layer's scaled dot product attention values, such that run-time complexity can be lowered while maintaining the interpretability of the model.","Meanwhile, a parallel line of research has exploredinjecting predefined patterns into attention matrices of transformers in an attemptto reduce the run-time complexity of self-attention while maintaining competitive accuracy.This can be done by either replacing theattention weights with a fixed matrix (Raganato et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2020); or alternatively by guiding the attention weights through more flexible masking strategies (Mihaylov and Frank, 2019; Child et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2021). Once the important patterns are identified, there are two common approaches(i.e. fixing and masking)to injectthem as constraints to the attention matrices in the transformer-based neural models (see §3.2). The pipeline alsoenables two scenarios,in which injectingthe patterns can be beneficial:the first one is to train a new model with the patterns injected, while the second one is to enhance the original model. Overall, with the discovered patterns injected,our models are arguably more interpretable thanplain transformers on both tasks, as we know with certaintythe information encoded in each masked/fixed attention heads. To further justify our claim of interpretability, the attention headswith patterns injectedtend to have higher importance scores than the other heads666An illustrative example is shown in Appendix C.1, suggesting that such patterns are effectively leveraged by the model."
"Beyond simple addition of a constant to the attention values, how can the patterns applied back to the original model?","Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

To ensure representativeness of the training data.

The authors chose to use only one composer (Chopin) for their training data to ensure that the model is exposed to a representative range of Western musical expression, as Chopin's works are considered to be a benchmark for Western classical music. By using a single composer, the authors could ensure that the model is trained on a consistent style and aesthetic, which would make it more difficult to generalize to other composers and styles",Patterns can be applied to a pretrained transformer either by adding a set of pre-computed constants or by adding an input-dependent weight matrix.,"In this work, we injectthe discovered patternsby either fixing or masking the attention weights prior to the softmax function.For fixed attention weights, the attention logits in the scaled-dot-product attention is replaced with a fixed (possibly input dependent) matrix such that:\textrm{FixAttn}(V,X)=\sigma(F^{(P)}(X))V(2)where \sigma is the softmax operation, V is the value vectors, and F(X)\in[0,1] computes a binary matrix from the input sequence X based on the predicated P for the specific pattern. Similarly, a pattern can also be injectedby casting a mask over the attention weights computed from the key and query vectors, as:\textrm{MaskAttn}(Q,K,V,X)=\sigma(M^{(P)}(X)+QK^{T})V(3)where M(X)\in[0,-\infty) computes the desired behaviour in the same fashion as F(X), and is added to the attention logits to approximate the multiplication of the attention distribution by a weight."
How can attention patterns from larger models be applied to smaller models if the models might differ in the size and number of attention layers?,CNN training learns to ignore areas that appear in both healthy and diseased lungs by setting very small filter weights around the corresponding regions,"BERTSum is the summarization model, and Cross-Segment BERT is the topic segmentation model. The paper does not discuss transferring patterns onto pretrained transformers of different architecture.","After verifying on the validation set, we discoverthree patternsconsistently existing in both tasks (over 50% of important heads).This suggests that important patterns are generalizable across multiple NLP tasks, whichis consistent with the findings in Bian et al. (2021). Further analysis also shows that the attention patterns are consistent after fine-tuning, where we report an average Jensen-Shannon Divergenceof 0.01 between the attention distributions of BERTSum across 3 random seeds.We hope our findings provide motivation for the in-depth study of pattern importance in different NLP tasks. Lastly, while it may be argued that this step of the pipeline can be automated by directly evaluating the importance and relevance of predefined patterns (e.g. syntax, discourse) based on intuitions, as indicated below, our interactive approach allows the discovery of interpretable patterns which otherwise would be hard to define due to the infinite search space of possible patterns. Next, we describe the three discovered patterns in detail."
What is the BERTSum model and how does it differ from just the BERT model?,"Direct warping between different views is achieved using a similar strategy as in [54], which involves learning a differentiable bilinear sampling mechanism to interpolate the values of the 4-pixel neighbors of the target pixel, and then using these interpolated values to approximate the appearance of the scene seen from the novel viewpoint","BERTSum is a specialized variant of BERT on the task of extractive summarization, picking out the sentences from a text to constitute its summary.","We adopt the popular BERTSum (Liu and Lapata, 2019) for extractive summarization. With the contextualized representation from BERT, the model uses a binary classifier to predict whether each sentence belongs in the summary. We train the model on the CNN/DM dataset (See et al., 2017), and use ROUGE (Lin, 2004) as the evaluation metric. Extractive summarization is the taskof picking the most representative sentences as the summary for the given document(s). Current state-of-the-art models, which are mostly based on large-scale pretrained language models Liu and Lapata (2019); Zhong et al. (2020); Jia et al. (2020); Ruan et al. (2022), can deliver good performance, but why and how such models work so well still remain an open question. In our case study, we adoptthe popular BERTSum(Liu and Lapata, 2019)."
How was performance measured and was the performance of the human-guided knowledge distilled model significantly higher?,Yes. The authors extended the DeepFool method to the multiclass case using the commonly used one-vs-all scheme,Interpretability is measured with the PDR framework. Summarization performance measured in ROUGE is 15% better. Topic segmentation performance measured in F1 is 12% better.,"In both scenarios, we argue the interpretability of the resulting model is improved. We provide a justification of our claim based on the Predictive, Descriptive, and Relevant (PDR) framework proposed by Murdoch et al. (2019). Specifically, by injecting human-interpretable patterns into the model, we increase the model’s descriptive accuracy by explicitly encoding useful relationships between input tokens in the attention weights while simultaneously improving the predictive accuracy in task performance. Further, the patterns are relevant for the problem since they are discovered in the human-in-the-loop process and are verified to be important for the task. As shown in Table 1, our pattern-infused models outperform the plain transformer models for both the CNN/DM and NYT-50 datasets under all three settings(6 Layer 8 Heads, 6 Layer 12 Heads, and 6 Layer 12 Heads with BERT embeddings).Similarly for topic segmentation,results also show that the pattern-injection approach substantially outperforms the vanilla transformer across all metrics.It is worthemphasizing that the performance gain is slightly higher for summarization models. When normalized by the ROUGE scores of extractive oracle summaries555As reported by Liu and Lapata (2019), the ROUGE scores (R-1/R-2/R-L) of the oracle upper bound for CNN/DM and NYT-50 are respectively, 52.59/31.24/48.87 and 49.18/33.24/46.02., the pattern-infused summarization models achieve an average 15\% improvement over the baselines, while the topic-segmentation models achieve a 12\% improvement over the baselines.In-line with prior work (McCoy et al., 2020), we also find that the performance is consistent across random seeds, where we report an extremely low standard deviation of0.03 (ROUGE) and 0.002 (F1) for extractive summarization and topic segmentation, respectively. Overall, the results from our experiments convincingly demonstrates the benefits of our approach and the generalizability of the patterns discovered by our pipeline. In summary, the key aim of our experiments was to verify consistent improvements over our own baselines under the same settings in order to probethe benefits (effectiveness and efficiency) of the discovered patterns for the task. Therefore, we do not perform extensive tuning to achieve the same results reported by Liu and Lapata (2019)."

Overall, the results from our experiments convincingly demonstrates the benefits of our approach and the generalizability of the patterns discovered by our pipeline."
What is the difference between calculating the Taylor expansion and the Hessian?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

We manually label the silhouette code for each product using in-house fashion experts, and review it with a separate team at Zalando","Hessian is the second-order partial derivative matrix itself, and Taylor expansion is the method used to approximate it.","We adapt the Taylor expansion method (Molchanov et al., 2019) as a proxy score for the head importance estimation.Following Li et al. (2021), we use the first-order expansion to avoid the overhead from computing the Hessian, where the gradient w.r.t. the validation loss is summed over all parameters of an attention head to estimate its importance."
"Instead of automatically identifying important attention patterns, why should a human be involved in this process?","DPR retriever is different from BM25 in that it uses a PLM to empower the retriever with a single vector, while BM25 uses a traditional sparse retriever",Human involvement can provide interpretable results from the identified patterns and the performance enhancement from the pattern injection.,"Once the the most important heads are identified, their attention distributions are inspected to look for patterns. In this work, we propose and test a novel human-in-the-loop pipeline that to the best of our knowledge is the first attemptto combine research on analyzing self-attention with work on injecting patterns into attention matrices.To start, human users visually explore the attention matrices of transformers to identify task-specific patterns that could be formalized as a predicate. After quantitatively evaluating the patterns on the validation set, they can be injected into attention heads of transformer models to simultaneously improve task accuracy and make the model more efficient by sparsifying the attention matrices111The implementation of our work is publicly available at: https://github.com/raymondzmc/Attention-Pattern-Exploitation. This is in contrast to previous work that mostly focuses on the trade-off between two metrics. To discovertask-specific patterns,we analyze the top-3 most important heads of each layer, and look forhuman-interpretable relationships encoded in the attention weights. In practice, we use the instance-level interactions provided by the visual framework (Li et al., 2021), and randomly select 5 validation examples per task for our analysis.The entire process takesless than one hour to complete for each task, where we manually examinethe attention weights for less than half of the tokens for each example.It is worth noting that detailed analysis regarding the trade-off between human costandpattern recallwould require extensive user studies beyond the scope of this work. As future work, we plan to apply our pipeline to other NLP tasks (e.g. language modeling, abstractive summarization) and explore and verify whether the important patterns from one task can be transferable to another task. Similarly, we also plan to apply our pipeline to different model variants to examine and compare the patterns encoded in the attention weights.In the long term, our pipeline could be naturally automated by replacing the pattern discovery step with evaluating predefined linguistic patterns. However, assessing the efficiency gains from injecting such patterns (requiring ground-truth annotations) would require more in-depth studies beyond the scope of this paper.Finally, since human factors are an important aspect of interpretability, we plan to conduct extensive user studies across different NLP tasks and model sizes to examine the trade-off between human-cost and the coverage of discovered patterns."
"Why are the patterns only defined between pairs of tokens instead of other possible options (e.g., trios, sequence, sets)?","When the context provides misleading cues.

In the third example, the cross-encoder is able to correctly identify the entity ""Ancient Greek"" despite the word ""philosophers"" being in the context, which could have misled the bi-encoder into linking the entity to ""Ancient Greek philosophy"" instead",The structural definition of a pattern in this paper follows only naturally from the design of the attention mechanism.,"We define an attention pattern to be interpretable iff it can be modeled as a predicate P between any pair of input tokens (x_{i},x_{j}).For instance, the positional pattern ‘preceding token’ would be true if x_{i} appears before x_{j}. Candidate patterns can be discovered following two criteria:1) they are beneficial for the downstream task;2) they occur consistently among relevant tokens. This pattern describes the “attending to matching tokens” behaviour, wherethe attention value \alpha_{i,j}^{h} between input tokens x_{i} and x_{j} on the head h is high whenever x_{i}=x_{j}. For example, as shown in footnote 3 (i), the token ""photo"" mostly attends to other appearances of the token ""photo"" in the input sequence. To evaluate whether this pattern has a large global relevance for any head, we only consider tokens that appear at least twice within a single documents, and compute GR (Eq. 1), in which P(x_{i},x_{j}) holds if and only if x_{i}=x_{j}, i.e. \mathbbm{1}_{P(x_{i},x_{j})}=(\mathbbm{1}_{\textrm{freq}(x_{i})>1})\times(\mathbbm{1}_{x_{i}=x_{j}}). This pattern describes the behaviour of only attending to tokens within a text span.For summarization, these heads will focus on attending tokens within the same sentence (footnote 3 (ii)). Similarly, the same heads in topic segmentation models will focus on attending tokens within the same context (left or right).To evaluate this pattern, GR is computed with P(x_{i},x_{j}) holding iff x_{i} and x_{j} occur within the same text span. footnote 3 (C) reveals that this pattern appears more frequently in the mid to upper layers of the transformer encoder."
"Then, overall, is it true that a pattern is determined to have global relevance on an attention head if the pattern has a significantly higher attention value across all samples in a dataset (compared to other heads)?",Masked language modeling and part-of-speech (POS) tagging,"Yes, it is.","With a pattern discoveredin §3.1.2, this step confirms the pattern’s global relevance by empirically measuring the proportion of attention values aligning with the pattern. For each attention head, the associated predicate is evaluated over the entire validation set to ensure the pattern is not appearing by chance on the certain data that the user happen to look at. Specifically, we define the global relevance (GR) of a pattern P for a head h as follows:\textrm{GR}(P,h)=\frac{1}{|X|}\sum_{x\in X}\frac{\sum_{i}^{|x|}\sum_{j}^{|x|}\alpha_{i,j}^{(x,h)}\cdot\mathbbm{1}_{P(x_{i},x_{j})}}{|x|}(1)where the attention value from the token x_{i} to x_{j} on the head h for an input sample x, denoted as \alpha_{i,j}^{(x,h)}, is aggregated if and only if P(x_{i},x_{j}) holds. To validate a pattern’s generality, the relevance is averaged over the validation set X. This pattern describes the “attending to matching tokens” behaviour, wherethe attention value \alpha_{i,j}^{h} between input tokens x_{i} and x_{j} on the head h is high whenever x_{i}=x_{j}. For example, as shown in footnote 3 (i), the token ""photo"" mostly attends to other appearances of the token ""photo"" in the input sequence. To evaluate whether this pattern has a large global relevance for any head, we only consider tokens that appear at least twice within a single documents, and compute GR (Eq. 1), in which P(x_{i},x_{j}) holds if and only if x_{i}=x_{j}, i.e. \mathbbm{1}_{P(x_{i},x_{j})}=(\mathbbm{1}_{\textrm{freq}(x_{i})>1})\times(\mathbbm{1}_{x_{i}=x_{j}})."
How does using the fixed attention approach affect performance differently when compared to the masked attention approach?,"By demonstrating that their method can successfully capture finer details of personalized objects that the image encoder (CLIP) is unlikely to have seen, such as color patterns on a teapot or a skull mug, using only a single word embedding",There is no discussion on how the performance difference is brought about.,"In this work, we injectthe discovered patternsby either fixing or masking the attention weights prior to the softmax function.For fixed attention weights, the attention logits in the scaled-dot-product attention is replaced with a fixed (possibly input dependent) matrix such that:\textrm{FixAttn}(V,X)=\sigma(F^{(P)}(X))V(2)where \sigma is the softmax operation, V is the value vectors, and F(X)\in[0,1] computes a binary matrix from the input sequence X based on the predicated P for the specific pattern. Similarly, a pattern can also be injectedby casting a mask over the attention weights computed from the key and query vectors, as:\textrm{MaskAttn}(Q,K,V,X)=\sigma(M^{(P)}(X)+QK^{T})V(3)where M(X)\in[0,-\infty) computes the desired behaviour in the same fashion as F(X), and is added to the attention logits to approximate the multiplication of the attention distribution by a weight. Although the two methods are very similar with respect to the improvement they contribute (see §4), masking allows more flexibility and is generally used for patterns with a large number of applicable tokens, while fixing is more rigid and better suited for a small number of applicable tokens."
"How did the authors measure ""interpretability""?","The properties of contrastive self-supervised learning that have attracted attention from researchers in the recommendation field include maximizing mutual information among positive transformations of the data itself, improving discrimination ability to negatives, and incorporating correlations among items, sub-sequences, and attributes of a given user behavior sequence",The authors' definition of interpretability is measured in terms of higher importance scores in the attention heads.,"In both scenarios, we argue the interpretability of the resulting model is improved. We provide a justification of our claim based on the Predictive, Descriptive, and Relevant (PDR) framework proposed by Murdoch et al. (2019). Specifically, by injecting human-interpretable patterns into the model, we increase the model’s descriptive accuracy by explicitly encoding useful relationships between input tokens in the attention weights while simultaneously improving the predictive accuracy in task performance. Further, the patterns are relevant for the problem since they are discovered in the human-in-the-loop process and are verified to be important for the task. Overall, with the discovered patterns injected,our models are arguably more interpretable thanplain transformers on both tasks, as we know with certaintythe information encoded in each masked/fixed attention heads. To further justify our claim of interpretability, the attention headswith patterns injectedtend to have higher importance scores than the other heads666An illustrative example is shown in Appendix C.1, suggesting that such patterns are effectively leveraged by the model. In the context of Machine Learning, interpretability can be defined as the description of the internals of a model in a way that is understandable to humans (Gilpin et al., 2018).With the rise of deep learning, various techniques have been proposed to interpret the inner workings of neural NLP models. For example, probing classifiers are often used for finding linguistic or knowledge information learned by neural networks (Conneau et al., 2018; Tenney et al., 2019; Pimentel et al., 2020; Voita and Titov, 2020; Hou and Sachan, 2021; Aghazadeh et al., 2022), while behaviour testing aims at understanding how models behave through inferences under different controlled settings (McCoy et al., 2019; Ross and Pavlick, 2019; Ribeiro et al., 2020; Koh et al., 2021; Goel et al., 2021). In contrast, our work is an example of making interpretability an inherent attribute of the neural models (e.g. Chen and Ji (2020); Hu et al. (2021)),with human-distinguishable patterns revealing insights regarding a subset of parameters in the model."
Fast R-CNN is more than six times faster than some of the baseline models. Is it true?,ORB features extract salient keypoint locations in the input images,"Probably true. Despite there is no provided baseline model, (in evidences) Fast R-CNN is more than six times faster than R-CNN is true.","Fast training and testing times are our second main result.Table 4 compares training time (hours), testing rate (seconds per image), and mAP on VOC07 between Fast R-CNN, R-CNN, and SPPnet.For VGG16, Fast R-CNN processes images 146\times faster than R-CNN without truncated SVD and 213\times faster with it.Training time is reduced by 9\times, from 84 hours to 9.5.Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 2.7\times faster (in 9.5 vs. 25.5 hours) and tests 7\times faster without truncated SVD or 10\times faster with it.Fast R-CNN also eliminates hundreds of gigabytes of disk storage, because it does not cache features."
"What was the problem of previous work, R-CNN in terms of the efficiency?","A global key signature refers to a specific set of chords and their relationships that are associated with a particular key or tonality. It provides a harmonic context for a melody, helping to establish a sense of coherence and structure in music",R-CNN needs multi-stage pipeline training and time consumes when evaluate them.,"The Region-based Convolutional Network method (R-CNN) [9] achieves excellent object detection accuracy by using a deep ConvNet to classify object proposals.R-CNN, however, has notable drawbacks:1.Training is a multi-stage pipeline.R-CNN first fine-tunes a ConvNet on object proposals using log loss.Then, it fits SVMs to ConvNet features.These SVMs act as object detectors, replacing the softmax classifier learnt by fine-tuning.In the third training stage, bounding-box regressors are learned.2.Training is expensive in space and time.For SVM and bounding-box regressor training, features are extracted from each object proposal in each image and written to disk.With very deep networks, such as VGG16, this process takes 2.5 GPU-days for the 5k images of the VOC07 trainval set.These features require hundreds of gigabytes of storage.3.Object detection is slow.At test-time, features are extracted from each object proposal in each test image.Detection with VGG16 takes 47s / image (on a GPU). R-CNN is slow because it performs a ConvNet forward pass for each object proposal, without sharing computation.Spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPPnets) [11] were proposed to speed up R-CNN by sharing computation.The SPPnet method computes a convolutional feature map for the entire input image and then classifies each object proposal using a feature vector extracted from the shared feature map.Features are extracted for a proposal by max-pooling the portion of the feature map inside the proposal into a fixed-size output (e.g., 6\times 6).Multiple output sizes are pooled and then concatenated as in spatial pyramid pooling [15].SPPnet accelerates R-CNN by 10 to 100\times at test time.Training time is also reduced by 3\times due to faster proposal feature extraction."
What strategy is used to reduce time spent on detection?,NO,Truncated SVD,Truncated SVD can reduce detection time by more than 30% with only a small (0.3 percentage point) drop in mAP and without needing to perform additional fine-tuning after model compression.Fig. 2 illustrates how using the top 1024 singular values from the 25088\times 4096 matrix in VGG16’s fc6 layer and the top 256 singular values from the 4096\times 4096 fc7 layer reduces runtime with little loss in mAP.Further speed-ups are possible with smaller drops in mAP if one fine-tunes again after compression.
What does “RoI” mean?,"No, we cannot use Faster R-CNN for human pose estimation. Instead, we need to use Mask R-CNN to predict K masks, one for each of K keypoint types",The RoI is a rectangular window into a conv feature map.,"The RoI pooling layer uses max pooling to convert the features inside any valid region of interest into a small feature map with a fixed spatial extent of H\times W (e.g., 7\times 7), where H and W are layer hyper-parameters that are independent of any particular RoI.In this paper, an RoI is a rectangular window into a conv feature map.Each RoI is defined by a four-tuple (r,c,h,w) that specifies its top-left corner (r,c) and its height and width (h,w)."
How was the ratio of extracted RoIs from object proposals?,Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) from [20],25%,"During fine-tuning, each SGD mini-batch is constructed from N=2 images, chosen uniformly at random (as is common practice, we actually iterate over permutations of the dataset).We use mini-batches of size R=128, sampling 64 RoIs from each image.As in [9], we take 25% of the RoIs from object proposals that have intersection over union (IoU) overlap with a ground-truth bounding box of at least 0.5.These RoIs comprise the examples labeled with a foreground object class, i.e. u\geq 1.The remaining RoIs are sampled from object proposals that have a maximum IoU with ground truth in the interval [0.1,0.5), following [11].These are the background examples and are labeled with u=0.The lower threshold of 0.1 appears to act as a heuristic for hard example mining [8].During training, images are horizontally flipped with probability 0.5.No other data augmentation is used."
What does “scale invariance” mean?,"Sure! Here's my answer:

FashionMNIST can be used for a wide range of machine learning tasks, including image classification, object detection, segmentation, and more",scale invariance means there are different scales on the table for model,"The multi-scale approach, in contrast, provides approximate scale-invariance to the network through an image pyramid.At test-time, the image pyramid is used to approximately scale-normalize each object proposal.During multi-scale training, we randomly sample a pyramid scale each time an image is sampled, following [11], as a form of data augmentation.We experiment with multi-scale training for smaller networks only, due to GPU memory limits. We compare two strategies for achieving scale-invariant object detection: brute-force learning (single scale) and image pyramids (multi-scale).In either case, we define the scale s of an image to be the length of its shortest side."
How SPPnet address the drawback of R-CNN?,"Yes.

By ignoring the IoU between 0.4 and 0.5, you are indeed losing some positive samples. This is because some true positive anchors may have an IoU value between 0.4 and 0.5, and by ignoring these values, you may be missing out on some correctly assigned anchors","SPPnet computes a convolutional feature map for the entire input image and then classifies each object proposal using a feature vector extracted from the shared feature map. By this method, SPPnet can solve time consuming issue which is occurred on R-CNN.","R-CNN is slow because it performs a ConvNet forward pass for each object proposal, without sharing computation.Spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPPnets) [11] were proposed to speed up R-CNN by sharing computation.The SPPnet method computes a convolutional feature map for the entire input image and then classifies each object proposal using a feature vector extracted from the shared feature map.Features are extracted for a proposal by max-pooling the portion of the feature map inside the proposal into a fixed-size output (e.g., 6\times 6).Multiple output sizes are pooled and then concatenated as in spatial pyramid pooling [15].SPPnet accelerates R-CNN by 10 to 100\times at test time.Training time is also reduced by 3\times due to faster proposal feature extraction."
Why does the author use a rectangular shaped RoI?,"To avoid the challenges of collecting large amounts of labeled data and doing feature engineering to keep the dimensionality low, and to leverage the inherent structure in videos to learn representations",in order to make a fixed feature map.,"The RoI pooling layer uses max pooling to convert the features inside any valid region of interest into a small feature map with a fixed spatial extent of H\times W (e.g., 7\times 7), where H and W are layer hyper-parameters that are independent of any particular RoI.In this paper, an RoI is a rectangular window into a conv feature map.Each RoI is defined by a four-tuple (r,c,h,w) that specifies its top-left corner (r,c) and its height and width (h,w)."
Why does the network receive not only input of images but also a list of RoI as the input value?,"SSD will predict boundary boxes based on the output of the convolutional network, without relying on ground truth boundaries",RoI extracts a fixed-length feature vector from the feature map in the model.,"Third, the network is modified to take two data inputs: a list of images and a list of RoIs in those images. Fig. 1 illustrates the Fast R-CNN architecture.A Fast R-CNN network takes as input an entire image and a set of object proposals.The network first processes the whole image with several convolutional (conv) and max pooling layers to produce a conv feature map.Then, for each object proposal a region of interest (RoI) pooling layer extracts a fixed-length feature vector from the feature map.Each feature vector is fed into a sequence of fully connected (fc) layers that finally branch into two sibling output layers: one that produces softmax probability estimates over K object classes plus a catch-all “background” class and another layer that outputs four real-valued numbers for each of the K object classes.Each set of 4 values encodes refined bounding-box positions for one of the K classes."
Perplexity is used to evaluate what performance?,"Sure! Here's the answer to your question based on the provided context:

Does large model always shows better performance than small model?,"The paper shows that the clustering result can be interpreted as users' intent by demonstrating that the learned intent variables can capture users' distinct behaviors and preferences, and that the number of intent classes (K) affects the performance of the recommendation model. The paper also compares the learned intent variables with other methods of modeling users' intents, such as using side information (e.g., user action types) or incorporating intent into the recommendation model directly",No.,"As can be seen from Table 3, our large model is on par with the existing state-of-the-art (Zaremba et al. 2014), despite having approximately 60% fewer parameters.

While lower perplex- ities have been reported with model ensembles (Mikolov and Zweig 2012), we do not include them here as they are not comparable to the current work."
Author shows that the batch size can affect the performance of the model. Is it true?,The computational complexity per data point of the wake-sleep algorithm is the same as AEVB,No.,The models are trained by truncated backpropagation through time (Werbos 1990; Graves 2013). We backprop- agate for 35 time steps using stochastic gradient descent where the learning rate is initially set to 1 . 0 and halved if the perplexity does not decrease by more than 1 . 0 on the validation set after an epoch.

Why did author try to use hierarchical softmax in optimization process?,"The space-time attention does not work well to generate consistent content because it only captures spatial similarities rather than pixel positions, leading to a lack of temporal consistency in the generated videos",They use hierachical softmax in order to increase learning speed.,"Finally, in order to speed up training on D ATA - L we em- ploy a hierarchical softmax (Morin and Bengio 2005)—a common strategy for training language models with very large |V| —instead of the usual softmax. We pick the number of clusters c = (cid:100) (cid:112) |V|(cid:101) and randomly split V into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subsets V 1 , . . . , V c of (approximately) equal size. 10 Then Pr ( w t +1 = j | w 1: t ) be- comes,"
