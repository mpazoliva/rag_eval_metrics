Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups. Five groups underwent MTrP modeling intervention, whereas one group did not receive intervention and was duly designated as the blank control. After model construction, five rat models were randomly subjected to ramp-and-hold stretch tests, succinylcholine injection, eperisone hydrochloride injection, saline injection, and blank drug intervention. By contrast, the rats in the blank control group were subjected to ramp-and-hold stretch tests as a control. Frequencies and amplitudes of PISPs were recorded pre- and post-interventions and compared with those of the blank group. Stretch tests showed that the depolarization time and amplitude of PISPs ranged from 0.4\u00a0ms to 0.9\u00a0ms and from 80 uV to 140\u00a0\u03bcV, respectively. However, no PISPs were observed in the control rats. The frequency of PISPs in the ramp and hold phases and the first second after the hold phase was higher than that before stretching (",
    "3": "People with Parkinson's disease (PD) face disruptions in arm swing (AS) motion during walking, including a reduction in amplitude and an increase in asymmetry. Both conditions are detrimental to gait performance. Nordic walking (NW) is a walking modality that uses poles and can positively affect the parameters of AS. This study aims to compare an NW with a free walking (FW) protocol and investigate its effects on AS asymmetry, AS amplitude and gait parameters in people with PD. Twenty-eight people with PD, stages 1-3 on the Hoehn and Yahr Scale, will be randomly assigned to the NW training group (n=14) or the FW training group (n=14). The primary outcomes are amplitude asymmetry of AS (%) and AS amplitude (deg). We will also analyse temporospatial measurements during walking, functional mobility and quality of life. Blinded researchers will conduct evaluations at baseline (T0), postintervention (T1) and at 1\u2009month follow-up (T2). Participants will complete 24 supervised NW or FW training sessions for 12 weeks. This is the first study to address the effects of NW on the asymmetry of AS, AS amplitude and its influence on gait parameters. We hypothesise that an NW programme in PD will reduce the asymmetry and increase the AS amplitude during gait to a greater extent than FW. The results of this study may provide new evidence to understand the effects of NW on gait in people with PD. The study was registered in ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT06342271).",

    "7": "Femoral neck stress fractures (FNSFs) are rare but significant injuries, often leading to delayed diagnosis due to nonspecific symptomatology. This case report presents a 30-year-old professional surfer who experienced acute groin pain during a half marathon, ultimately diagnosed with a left intertrochanteric line femur stress fracture and with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) in the opposite hip. Despite being physically fit, his presentation challenges the prevailing notion that FNSFs predominantly occur in military personnel or the elderly. The patient underwent surgical left hip osteosynthesis without complications. This case highlights the importance of early suspicion of FNSFs in young, active individuals and emphasizes the need for comprehensive evaluation to prevent complications like osteonecrosis and malunion. It underscores the value of a broad differential diagnosis and timely intervention in optimizing outcomes, especially in the context of rising high-impact sports participation.",

Effective management measures for controlling FHB are not available, due to a lack of resistant cultivars. Currently, the utilization of biological control is a promising approach that can be used to help manage FHB. Previous studies have confirmed that Streptomyces pratensis S10 harbors excellent inhibitory effects on F. graminearum. However, there is no information regarding invasive hyphae of F. graminearum are inhibited by S10. Thus, we investigated the effects of S10 on F. graminearum strain PH-1 hyphae extension, toxisome formation, and TRI5 gene expression on wheat plants via microscopic observation. The results showed that S10 effectively inhibited spread of F. graminearum hyphae along the rachis, restricting the infection of neighboring florets via the phloem. In the presence of S10, the hyphal growth is impeded by formation of dense cell wall thickenings in the rachis internode surrounding the F. graminearum infection site, avoiding cell plasmolysis and collapse. We further demonstrated that S10 largely prevented cell-to-cell invasion of fungal hyphae inside wheat coleoptiles using a constitutively green fluorescence protein-expressing F. graminearum strain, PH-1. Importantly, S. pratensis S10 inhibited toxisome formation and TRI5 gene expression in wheat plants during infection. Collectively, these findings indicated that S. pratensis S10 prevents spread of F. graminearum invasive hyphae via the rachis.",

The aim of the present study is to determine the antibacterial potential of endolichenic fungi isolated from genus Parmotrema. The study is continuation of our previous work, wherein a total of 73 endolichenic fungi were isolated from the lichenized fungi, which resulted in 47 species under 23 genera. All the isolated endolichenic fungi were screened for preliminary antibacterial activity. Five endolichenic fungi-Daldinia eschscholtzii, Nemania diffusa, Preussia sp., Trichoderma sp. and Xylaria feejeensis, were selected for further antibacterial activity by disc diffusion method. The zone of inhibition ranged from 14.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 to 23.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1. The chemical composition of the selected endolichenic fungi was analysed through GC-MS, which yielded a total of 108 compounds from all the selected five endolichenic fungi. Diethyl phthalate, 1-hexadecanol, dibutyl phthalate, n-tetracosanol-1, 1-nonadecene, pyrrol[1,2-a] pyrazine-1,4-dione, hexahydro-3-(2-methyl) and tetratetracontane were found to be common compounds among one or the other endolichenic fungi, which possibly were responsible for antibacterial activity. GC-MS data were further analysed through Principal Component Analysis which showed D. eschscholtzii to be with unique pattern of expression of metabolites. Compound confirmation test revealed coumaric acid to be responsible for antibacterial activity in D. eschscholtzii. So, the study proves that endolichenic fungi that inhabit lichenized fungal thalli could be a source of potential antibacterial compounds.",

    "15": "Pollen tube growth is an essential step leading to reproductive success in flowering plants, in which vesicular trafficking plays a key role. Vesicular trafficking from endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus is mediated by the coat protein complex II (COPII). A key component of COPII is small GTPase Sar1. Five Sar1 isoforms are encoded in the Arabidopsis genome and they show distinct while redundant roles in various cellular and developmental processes, especially in reproduction. Arabidopsis Sar1b is essential for sporophytic control of pollen development while Sar1b and Sar1c are critical for gametophytic control of pollen development. Because functional loss of Sar1b and Sar1c resulted in pollen abortion, whether they influence pollen tube growth was unclear. Here we demonstrate that Sar1b mediates pollen tube growth, in addition to its role in pollen development. Although functional loss of Sar1b does not affect pollen germination, it causes a significant reduction in male transmission and of pollen tube penetration of style. We further show that membrane dynamics at the apex of pollen tubes are compromised by Sar1b loss-of-function. Results presented provide further support of functional complexity of the Sar1 isoforms.",

Conventional wastewater treatment methods employed in treatment plants rarely address these persistent pollutants adequately. Meanwhile, the concept of green synthesis has garnered considerable attention, owing to its environmentally friendly approach that utilizes fewer toxic chemicals and solvents. The utilization of materials derived from sustainable sources presents a promising avenue for solving pressing environmental concerns. Among the various sources of biological agents, plants stand out for their accessibility, eco-friendliness, and rich reserves of phytochemicals suitable for material synthesis. The plant extract-mediated synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) has emerged as a promising solution for applications in wastewater treatment. Thorough investigations into the factors influencing the properties of these green ZnONPs are essential to establish a detailed and reliable synthesis process. Major weaknesses inherent in ZnONPs can be addressed by changing the optical, magnetic, and interface properties through doping with various semiconductor materials. Consequently, research efforts to mitigate water pollution are being driven by both the future prospects and limitations of ZnO-based composites. This review underscores the recent advancements of plant extract-mediated ZnONP composites for water treatment.",

Tannic acid (TA), an organic compound in many plants, has garnered recent attention for its discernible anti-mutagenic attributes. This investigation endeavored to scrutinize the repercussions of TA on grade II bladder cancer, with a concerted focus on unraveling its anti-cancer mechanisms. The cytotoxic effects of TA on grade II bladder cancer cells were investigated using multiple techniques, including MTT assay, flow cytometry, TUNEL assay, and western blot. Our findings revealed that elevated concentrations of TA induced cytotoxic effects in grade II bladder cancer cells. Both flow cytometry and the TUNEL assay substantiated the dose-dependent capacity of TA to prompt apoptosis. Western blot analysis corroborated that TA treatment in bladder cancer cells resulted in the upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 expression and PARP. Furthermore, heightened TA dosage elicited an augmentation in the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, namely Bax and Bak, alongside a reduction in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 within bladder cancer cells. This study confirms TA as a potential anticancer agent, demonstrably diminishing the viability of bladder cancer cells. TA exerts cytotoxicity through the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. Specifically, TA initiates the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, concurrently augmenting the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins to facilitate apoptosis. Collectively, the present study indicates that TA effectively impedes the proliferation of bladder cancer cells by instigating apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.",

Soil salinity affects many physiological processes of plants and leads to crop yield losses worldwide. For hemp, a crop that is valued for multiple aspects, such as its medical compounds, fibre, and seed, a comprehensive understanding of its salt stress responses is a prerequisite for resistance breeding and tailoring its agronomic performance to suit certain industrial applications. Here, we first observed the phenotype of salt-stressed hemp plants and found that under NaCl treatment, hemp plants displayed pronounced growth defects, as indicated by the significantly reduced average height, number of leaves, and chlorophyll content. Next, we conducted comparative proteomics and metabolomics to dissect the complex salt-stress response mechanisms. A total of 314 proteins and 649 metabolites were identified to be differentially behaving upon NaCl treatment. Functional classification and enrichment analysis unravelled that many differential proteins were proteases associated with photosynthesis. Through metabolic pathway enrichment, several energy-related pathways were found to be altered, such as the biosynthesis and degradation of branched-chain amino acids, and our network analysis showed that many ribosomal proteins were involved in these metabolic adaptations. Taken together, for hemp plants, influences on chloroplast function probably represent a major toxic effect of salinity, and modulating several energy-producing pathways possibly through translational regulation is presumably a key protective mechanism against the negative impacts. Our data and analyses provide insights into our understanding of hemp's stress biology and may lay a foundation for future functional genomics studies."
