1. They first create a set of contextualized representations for each word using a pre-trained language model, such as BERT or ELMO. These representations capture the word's meaning in the context of the surrounding words.
2. They then take the first principal component (PC) of these contextualized representations as the static embedding for each word. The first PC captures the most important information in the representations, and is often found to be a good approximation of the word's meaning.
3. They use this static embedding for each word as input to a downstream task, such as semantic similarity or analogy solving.

The authors note that using the first PC of the contextualized representations often outperforms using the raw word embeddings (such as GloVe or FastText) or the full set of contextualized representations. This is because the first PC captures the most important information in the representations, and can be used to capture the word's meaning in a more compact and efficient way.

In the table provided earlier, the authors show the performance of different static embedding methods on several benchmark tasks. The tasks include semantic similarity, analogy solving, concept categorization, and Semeval.

Here are some common methods for measuring model compactness:

1. Model size: One simple way to measure compactness is to count the number of parameters or the size of the model in terms of the number of weights, layers, or other components. This can be done using metrics such as the number of parameters, the number of layers, or the size of the model in megabytes (MB).
2. Model complexity: Another way to measure compactness is to evaluate the complexity of the model using metrics such as the number of computations required to make predictions, the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required, or the amount of memory used during inference.
3. Model depth: The depth of the model can also be used as a measure of compactness. Shallow models with fewer layers are generally more compact than deep models with many layers.
4. Model width: The width of the model, i.e., the number of input features or the number of output classes, can also be used as a measure of compactness. Models with a smaller width are generally more compact than models with a larger width.
5. Model pruning: Another way to measure compactness is to prune the model and measure the reduction in size and accuracy. This can be done using techniques such as weight pruning, where redundant weights are removed, or layer pruning, where entire layers are removed.
6. Compression ratio: Finally, the compression ratio of the model can be used as a measure of compactness. This can be done by compressing the model using techniques such as Huffman coding or arithmetic coding, and then measuring the reduction in size.

In the context of the two sentences you provided, the models are being evaluated based on their accuracy and compactness. The first sentence mentions that the models should be ""even langidhigh"" (i.e., have high accuracy) and ""present accurate result"" (i.e., produce accurate predictions). The second sentence mentions that the models should be ""compact"" and ""present compact one langidhigh"" (i.e., have a small size and produce compact predictions).

1. Ethnicity bias: The dataset seems to be biased towards certain ethnic groups, particularly black and Asian babies, as they are more likely to be mentioned in the data. The words ""white"" and ""black"" are used more frequently than other ethnicities, which suggests that the dataset may be biased towards these groups.
2. Gender bias: The dataset may also be biased towards traditional gender roles, as the examples provided in the context suggest that female surgeons and male nurses are inconsistent with traditional gender roles. This bias may be reflected in the language used to describe the babies, as well as in the examples provided.
3. Labeling bias: The dataset may be biased towards creating narrow labels for individuals, as the adjectives used to describe the babies may create expectations for their personalities or characteristics based on their ethnicity or gender. For example, the phrase ""tough woman"" may be used to describe a woman who does not fit traditional gender roles, but this label may be inconsistent with the actual characteristics of the individual.
4. Inconsistent labeling bias: The dataset may be biased towards inconsistent labeling, as the examples provided in the context suggest that certain labels may be used to describe individuals based on their ethnicity or gender, but these labels may not be consistent with the actual characteristics of the individuals. For example, the phrase ""black baby"" may be used to describe a baby who is black, but this label may not accurately reflect the baby's actual characteristics.
5. Strengthens conclusion bias: The dataset may be biased towards strengthening a conclusion that is not supported by the data, as the examples provided in the context suggest that the data may be used to support the conclusion that the dataset is biased towards certain ethnic groups, but this conclusion may not be supported by the actual data.

Overall, the dataset may be biased towards certain groups or characteristics, and it may be inconsistent in its labeling and descriptions of individuals. These biases may be reflected in the language used to describe the babies, as well as in the examples provided in the context",0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3842654848863454e-29,0.362507820277293,0.3096923745645492,0.0313807531380753,0.0099009900990099,0.6350318193435669,0.8504218518733978,0.5824826955795288,0.6340262,0.0223118822047789,1.0,0.9490220330313252,0.8318434004268387

On the other hand, the model performs relatively worse for recognizing explicit discourse relations, with a slight decrease in performance compared to previous systems. The model achieves a macro-average F-score of 88.3% for explicit discourse relations, which is still good but not as high as its performance for implicit relations.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. RNNs: In the first paper, the authors use a combination of BERT and a recurrent LSTM network (BiBRE) to perform text classification. They find that the RNN layer can capture long-term dependencies in the text sequence, which can be useful for certain tasks. However, they also note that the RNN layer can be computationally expensive and may not be as effective for very long sequences.
2. Transformers: In the second paper, the authors use a combination of BERT and a transformer network (RoBERTa and ToBERT) to perform text classification. They find that the transformer layer can capture both local and global dependencies in the text sequence, which can be useful for tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of the text. Additionally, they note that the transformer layer can be more efficient than the RNN layer for very long sequences.
3. Hierarchical representations: Both papers propose using hierarchical representations to improve the performance of the models. In the first paper, the authors use a combination of segment-level and document-level representations to capture both local and global dependencies in the text. In the second paper, the authors use a combination of word-level, segment-level, and document-level representations to capture a wide range of dependencies.
4. Fine-tuning: Both papers emphasize the importance of fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT models for the specific task at hand. They find that fine-tuning the models can significantly improve their performance, especially when compared to using the pre-trained models without any fine-tuning.

In summary, both RNNs and transformers can work well on top of BERT, depending on the specific task and dataset being used. The choice between the two may depend on the specific requirements of the task, such as the need to capture long-term dependencies or the need for efficient computation. Additionally, using hierarchical representations and fine-tuning the pre-trained models can further improve their performance",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5378534566649347e-27,0.9092234592987726,0.7621724314300329,0.0221238938053097,0.0099009900990099,0.2928208410739898,0.8181818181818182,0.479553610086441,0.8083126,0.0093288501258072,1.0,0.8896286196562498,0.7674194613003085

1. Named Entity Recognition (NER): IPA recognizes and extracts custom entities from user input, assuming seven possible entities as defined in the table ""tabref"". The recognized entities are then converted into a universal standard, such as official chapter names, to facilitate post-labeling.
2. Next Action Prediction: IPA predicts the next action according to the given user input, considering custom actions defined in the table ""tabref"". The predicted actions are then labeled and added to the dataset.
3. Post-labeling: To ensure the accuracy of the predicted actions, IPA performs post-labeling on the original dataset, using the defined generic entity names such as ""chapter question nr"" and the variations of entities in the user input.
4. Plain Dialogues: IPA labels plain dialogues with unique dialogue indexes and pairs questions and responses with unique turn indexes.
5. Plain Information: IPA extracts information from the dialogues, such as entities, and stores it in a dictionary for further use.
6. Triples: IPA forms triples of user requests, next actions, and responses to train deep machine learning algorithms for dialogue management.

6. Incomplete Feature Database: It stores frequency information about incomplete paths in the form of tuples. The database is used to formulate machine learning queries.
7. Inference Stack: It is a stack that holds the query state information and the RL model. Lili always processes the top query on the stack.
8. Prediction Model: It is a model that learns from the past similar tasks and helps learn the current task. The model uses lifelong learning and transfer knowledge to improve its performance.
9. Similar Task Identification: It identifies similar tasks to the current task and factors them to compute the task similarity matrix.

Firstly, they propose a method that expands the requirement of monosemy by proposing several new sources of relatives, including previously unexplored sources based on WordNet data, to gather many training cases. This helps to alleviate the problem of uneven distribution of word senses.

Secondly, they modify the Nave Bayesian classifier by adjusting the prior probabilities of the target word senses based on the aggregated feature values corresponding to each sense. This helps to weaken the influence of improper distribution of training cases and omit context features that are not observed for every word sense.

Finally, they use a large corpus of million documents to build models based on training corpora of different sizes. Experiments show that the amount of training data is sufficient for the task.

In summary, the authors deal with unknown distribution senses by using a combination of techniques, including expanding the requirement of monosemy, modifying the Nave Bayesian classifier, and using a large corpus of training data",0.0190476178031746,0.0,0.0190476178031746,3.7739666645101965e-08,3.1542943479291408,2.5223783214134627,0.0506756756756756,0.0099009900990099,0.2882621586322784,0.6233080423884577,0.4817772507667541,0.53991455,0.0235089948521002,1.0,0.9603800324074424,0.8083252528762812

2. Emotion analysis: The research relies on depechemood dictionaries to analyze the emotions in the texts. The dictionaries are freely available and can be arranged in multiple ways. The research uses a version of the depechemood dictionary that includes words and their part-of-speech tags.
3. Content analysis: The research preprocesses the text corpora by analyzing word frequencies and normalizing the number of words in each corpus. The research then uses a baseline of random articles from the Reuters news dataset, which is a non-religious general resource, to compare the results.
4. Comparison of common words: The research compares the common words in the corpora from violent and non-violent religious groups to identify related themes. The research finds that the religious theme in the ISIS material appears stronger than in the non-violent religious group.
5. Coherence analysis: The research analyzes the topics within the corpora using coherence analysis. The research selects important words from each topic and assigns a general label to each topic based on the nmf output. The research finds that the ISIS articles address women and include topics such as Islamic law, women's role in early Islam, hijrah (moving to another land), and spousal relations.

1. Information beyond alignment: The analysis shows that attention models can capture information beyond traditional alignment cases, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between words in a sentence.
2. Translational equivalents: Attention agrees with traditional alignments for high-degree case nouns, but captures information about translational equivalents for verbs, including auxiliary verbs and adverbs.
3. Word prediction loss: Attention loss is related to translation quality, and analyzing the relationship between attention loss and word prediction loss can provide insights into the impact of attention on translation accuracy.
4. Distribution of attention: Attention is not equally distributed across all parts of speech, and the distribution of attention can vary substantially across different pos tags.
5. Dependency roles: Attention can capture the dependency roles of words in a sentence, such as subject-verb-object relationships, and this information can be useful for improving translation accuracy.
6. Translating nouns and verbs: Attention can help identify the roles of nouns and verbs in a sentence, including adjectives, determiners, and auxiliary verbs, which can be useful for improving the accuracy of translations",0.0336134444205918,0.0114285708734694,0.0336134444205918,1.7179542268912614e-08,1.6201391058250851,1.5723446250527635,0.1211726384364821,0.0099009900990099,0.1798114031553268,0.6201770625957826,0.6231029033660889,0.15735744,0.103158816851963,1.0,0.9477186209392086,0.742810155147352

1. Positional differences: Attention loss differs across different parts of speech (POS) tags, as shown in Figure 1. This indicates that attention is not always aligned with the position of the word in the sentence.
2. Frequency differences: Attention loss varies substantially across different POS tags, with nouns and verbs having different attention patterns. This suggests that attention is not solely determined by the position of the word, but also by its semantic meaning.
3. Concentration differences: Attention concentration, as measured by entropy, is not always aligned with the word alignments. This indicates that attention is not always evenly distributed across all words in a sentence, but can be more concentrated in certain words or parts of the sentence.

In summary, attention and alignment are different in the sense that attention can vary across different parts of the sentence, can be influenced by the semantic meaning of the words, and can be more concentrated in certain parts of the sentence",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.849336279848952e-05,1.658941402561704,1.4779753376817837,0.1349331926863572,0.0099009900990099,0.1487556397914886,0.4555068665317127,0.2546131610870361,0.338555,0.0055738241392735,,0.9571514275925588,0.7648149416728809

1. Crowdsourcing: The dataset was collected using scoping crowdsourcing tasks, where crowd workers were prompted to provide questions and commands related to specific topic domains. This helped to generate a large amount of data that could be used to train an AI assistant.
2. Manual annotation: The collected data was then manually grouped and annotated to identify the intents behind each question or command. This involved manually labeling each query with the intent it was intended to fulfill, such as booking a flight or checking the weather.
3. Scoping tasks: To ensure that the annotated data was representative of the team's limited budget, the crowd workers were given a set of scoping tasks to complete. These tasks were designed to gather additional data that could be used to train the AI assistant, while also ensuring that the data was relevant and useful for the intended task.
4. Intent training queries: The annotated data was then used to train the AI assistant using a set of intent training queries. These queries were designed to test the assistant's ability to understand the intents behind the queries and provide appropriate responses.
5. Validation and testing queries: To validate the performance of the AI assistant, a set of testing queries was created to test its ability to understand the intents behind the queries and provide appropriate responses. These queries were designed to be representative of the types of queries that the assistant would receive in real-world use cases.

Overall, the dataset was annotated using a combination of manual annotation and crowdsourcing to generate a large and diverse set of queries that could be used to train and validate an AI assistant.

In other words, it is a matrix that shows how often two words appear together in the same sentence or in close proximity to each other, taking into account the context provided by the surrounding words.

The second-order co-occurrence matrix is different from a first-order co-occurrence matrix, which only captures the frequency of words appearing together in the same sentence, without considering the context provided by the surrounding words. The second-order co-occurrence matrix is a more robust measure of co-occurrence, as it takes into account the context in which the words appear, and can help to capture more subtle patterns of meaning and contextual relationships between words.

The second-order co-occurrence matrix is typically constructed by counting the number of times that each word appears in the context of each other word in the corpus, and then representing these counts as a matrix.

Entity linking is the task of identifying and linking mentions of entities in unstructured text to their corresponding entries in a knowledge base.

The proposed method uses a deep learning model, specifically a combination of ELMo embeddings and a residual LSTM, to learn informative morphological representations of character sequences. These representations are then used to predict entity types. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled text, where each mention of an entity is annotated with its corresponding entity type.

To incorporate the knowledge base, the authors use a redirection list to map surface forms of entities to their corresponding entries in the knowledge base. The redirection list is a list of surface forms of entities that are equivalent to a single entry in the knowledge base. For example, ""Michael Jordan"" and ""Michael Jeffrey Jordan"" are both surface forms of the same entity in the knowledge base.

During training, the model is given a list of input tokens, and it predicts the entity types for each token. The model is trained to use the redirection list to map the input tokens to the corresponding entities in the knowledge base. This allows the model to learn the relationships between the surface forms of entities and their corresponding entries in the knowledge base.

The proposed method has several advantages over existing approaches. First, it combines the strengths of deep learning models and knowledge bases to improve the accuracy of entity linking. Second, it uses a redirection list to map surface forms of entities to their corresponding entries in the knowledge base, which helps to overcome the problem of ambiguity in entity mentions.

1. Loss of information: By clipping negative PMI, the model may be discarding useful information that could be used to improve rare word representations and word analogies.
2. Limited improvement: Clipping negative PMI may only provide limited improvement in rare word representations, as the negative information used to repel words may not be as effective as positive information in improving the representations.
3. Over-reliance on positive information: The model may become over-reliant on positive information, which could lead to biased representations of rare words and poor performance on negative word analogies.
4. Inability to capture negative relationships: Clipping negative PMI may prevent the model from capturing negative relationships between words, which could limit its ability to generalize to unseen data.
5. Increased risk of overfitting: By discarding negative information, the model may be more susceptible to overfitting, as it may not have enough information to learn from.

Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of clipping negative PMI and explore other methods for improving rare word representations and word analogies, such as incorporating PMI in the model or using other types of information, such as word embeddings or syntactic information",0.1025641011439842,0.0314136116674433,0.0854700840499671,3.3988249016535808e-06,3.947414772055717,3.6925301577283314,0.1256983240223464,0.0100950700774282,0.4118061363697052,1.1102230246251563e-16,0.5326918363571167,0.8096301,0.0425313589082593,0.8333333333333334,0.9967317050759356,0.8091405928961849

They then experimented with querying pre-trained language models (specifically, BERT) on both the original LAMA statements and the negated versions of those statements. They compared the predictions made by the models on these two sets of statements and found that the predicted filler words often had high overlap. This suggests that negating a cloze statement can significantly change the predictions made by the model, and that the model is not able to handle negation well.

To analyze this phenomenon further, they identified a subset of cloze statements where the predictions were different for the original and negated versions.

To capture this semantic similarity, the authors use a technique called ""embedding models,"" which map words or phrases to dense vector representations that capture their meaning. They specifically use three different embedding models: CBOW, PVDM, and GloVe.

The authors then use these embedding models to discover similar equations by comparing the vector representations of the words or phrases in the equations. They use two different methods to compare the vectors: cosine distance and Euclidean distance. The cosine distance measures the cosine of the angle between the vectors, while the Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between the vectors.

The decoder takes the previous output context information and the current input sequence feature vectors as input, and predicts the target sequence probability distribution over time. The beam search strategy is used to select the most likely sequence of words or characters at each time step, based on the predicted probability distribution. The final output of the decoder is a sequence of words or characters that forms a coherent and accurate transcription of the input speech.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the decoding process:

1. Initialization: The decoder starts by initializing a set of candidate sequences, each consisting of a sequence of words or characters. The length of the candidate sequences is determined by the maximum length of the input speech sequence.
2. Beam Search: The decoder uses a beam search strategy to select the most likely candidate sequences at each time step. The beam search strategy is based on the predicted probability distribution of the target sequence, which is computed by the decoder using the current input sequence feature vectors and the previous output context information.
3. Scoring: Each candidate sequence is scored based on its predicted probability distribution. The scores are used to rank the candidate sequences and select the top-ranked sequences for further processing.
4. Expansion: The decoder expands each selected candidate sequence by adding a new word or character to the end of the sequence, based on the predicted probability distribution of the next word or character.
5. Output: The final output of the decoder is a sequence of words or characters that forms a coherent and accurate transcription of the input speech.

The decoder uses a language model and a lexicon dictionary to generate text.

This process is repeated until the desired level of performance is achieved. The number of samples selected for annotation in each iteration is called the batch size.

Active learning is used to improve the performance of machine learning models by actively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, rather than relying on a random or exhaustive sampling approach. By selectively choosing the most informative samples, active learning can reduce the amount of labeling required and improve the efficiency of the training process.

In summary, the state of the art on the WSJ dataset for open vocabulary speech recognition is a combination of deep learning-based and HMM-based systems, with speaker adaptation and inlineform training, and the use of learnable frontend filters to improve performance",0.0,0.0,0.0,2.259420022970133e-18,0.4526014125977447,0.4101526335082286,0.0182481751824817,0.0099009900990099,0.3155601322650909,0.5206570004179635,0.5810762643814087,Error,0.0084361199984399,0.8333333333333334,0.8993905985081354,0.7793385489435656

1. Ambiguity: The first issue is that current ELSs struggle with ambiguity. Entities may have multiple possible meanings, and the system may not be able to disambiguate them correctly. For example, the entity ""South Korean"" can refer to a person, a language, or a country, and the system may not be able to determine which meaning is intended.
2. Coarseness: The second issue is that current ELSs may be too coarse-grained, linking entities that are not actually related. This can lead to errors and irrelevance in the summary. For instance, the entity ""Wednesday"" may be linked to ""Wednesday night baseball"" even if the two are not directly related.

These issues can result in low precision rates and design challenges for training datasets, as well as problems with the accuracy and relevance of the generated summaries. To address these challenges, the author suggests using experimental data to randomly select data instances and tag their correctness and relevance, and using four labels to distinguish between correct, relevant, somewhat relevant, and irrelevant entities. The results show a large amount of incorrect and irrelevant entities, highlighting the need for further improvement in ELSs",0.0281690132751438,0.0,0.0281690132751438,2.5669857578450784e-11,2.0821745532454083,1.752001604586738,0.0746268656716418,0.0099481174734637,0.4678322076797485,0.3894088540301227,0.2640839964151382,0.4317389,0.0165035327846035,1.0,0.9423229633693552,0.834082049165102

It involves a human ""seeker"" interacting with a conversational interface (such as a chatbot or virtual assistant) that is mediated by a human ""wizard"" who is able to see and respond to the seeker's inputs and actions. The wizard is typically a human researcher who is able to provide the seeker with information and support during the interaction.

In a Wizard of Oz setup, the seeker interacts with the conversational interface through a real-time text-based interface, such as a chat window or voice assistant. The wizard receives the seeker's messages and performs different information seeking actions on their behalf, such as searching for information or completing tasks. The interactions between the seeker and the wizard are logged and analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the conversational interface and to gather data for HCI and AI research.

The Wizard of Oz setup is useful for collecting high-quality data from real users in a controlled environment, which can be used to evaluate the performance of conversational interfaces and to improve their design and functionality.

The input article is represented as a sequence of words or a text, and the goal is to identify the section of the Wikipedia entity page that best matches the input article.

To determine the exact section to use the input article, the model is trained on a dataset of article-section pairs, where each pair consists of an article and the corresponding section from the Wikipedia entity page. The dataset is created by manually annotating the sections of the Wikipedia entity pages with the relevant articles.

The model is trained to predict the correct section of the Wikipedia entity page given the input article. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted section and the ground-truth section.

To determine the correct section, the model uses a combination of features such as the similarity between the input article and the sections of the Wikipedia entity page, the popularity of the sections, and the relevance of the sections to the input article. The model can use various techniques such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, and classification algorithms to compute the similarity and relevance of the sections to the input article.

For example, the model can use word embeddings to represent the words in the input article and the sections of the Wikipedia entity page as vectors in a high-dimensional space. The model can then compute the similarity between the vectors to determine the most relevant sections.

Additionally, the model can use recurrent neural networks to capture the sequential dependencies between the words in the input article and the sections of the Wikipedia entity page. The model can then use these dependencies to determine the most relevant sections.

Finally, the model can use classification algorithms to predict the correct section based on the similarity and relevance of the sections to the input article. The model can be trained on a multiclass classification problem, where each class represents a different section of the Wikipedia entity page.

Overall, the model is trained to determine the correct section of the Wikipedia entity page that is relevant to the input article by using a combination of features such as similarity, popularity, and relevance. The model can use various techniques such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, and classification algorithms to compute these features and make the prediction",0.0472440935879471,0.0,0.0472440935879471,7.355934857986513e-24,1.7972081591988192,1.4516253537863502,0.0281954887218045,0.0099482310279838,0.3340352177619934,0.4171899783034477,0.6508134007453918,0.45363706,0.0098352463447314,1.0,0.7688877674614153,0.8128389226642452

The chunks are then used as input to a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, which is trained to extract features from the tweets and predict the factuality of the accounts.

More specifically, the chunks are defined as follows:

1. The input representation of a Twitter account is defined as a sequence of tweets, where each tweet is represented as a vector of features.
2. The tweets are sorted in ascending order based on their posting date, and the resulting sequence of tweets is divided into overlapping chunks.
3. Each chunk consists of a sequence of tweets that are labeled with a corresponding account.
4. The features for each tweet are extracted using a set of predefined features, such as the presence of certain words or phrases, and the frequency of their use.
5. The final representation of a tweet is built by averaging the single word vectors for each tweet, and the resulting vector is used as input to the RNN model.

The main idea behind using chunks is to group related tweets together and analyze them as a sequence to capture any patterns or biases that may be indicative of suspicious or fake news accounts.

1. Bias metrics: The authors use bias metrics such as the word emission bias and the word frequency bias to measure the gender bias in the language model's output. These metrics measure the difference between the predicted probabilities of male and female words in the test set.
2. Perplexity: The authors also measure the perplexity of the language model on the test set, which is a measure of how well the model predicts the test set. They find that the mitigation of gender bias does not result in a significant increase in perplexity.
3. Inlineform value: The authors use the inlineform value, which is a measure of the ratio of male to female words in the generated texts, to evaluate the effectiveness of the bias mitigation methods. They find that the inlineform value is reduced after applying the bias mitigation methods.
4. Comparison to baseline: The authors compare the results of the bias mitigation methods to a baseline model that does not use any bias mitigation techniques.

1. Direct name-calling: Frequent use of direct name-calling to attack and insult individuals, often using animal names such as ""dog,"" ""donkey,"" ""beast,"" and ""pig.""
2. Simile and metaphor: Using simile and metaphor to compare individuals to animals or inanimate objects, such as comparing someone to a ""braying donkey"" or a ""wagging tail.""
3. Culturally specific differences: Using animal names that are typically used to praise, but in an offensive context, such as using ""lion"" or ""falcon"" to refer to someone in a derogatory way.
4. Indirect speech: Using indirect speech to convey offensive language, such as using sarcasm or philosophical questions to insult someone.
5. Name alteration: Changing the letters of someone's name to produce a new offensive word, such as changing ""aljzyrp"" to ""pig.""
6. Societal stratification: Insults associated with certain jobs or societal components, such as referring to someone as a ""doorman"" or a ""servant.""
7. Immoral behavior: Insults associated with negative moral traits or behaviors, such as referring to someone as a ""traitor"" or a ""hypocrite.""
8. Sexually related insults: Including expressions related to sexual orientation or prostitution, such as ""gay"" or ""prostitute.""
9. Wishing evil: Wishing death or major harm upon someone, such as ""may God take your soul"" or ""may Allah curse you.""

2. Targeted annotation: The annotation process is targeted towards identifying offensive language, rather than any specific topic or dialect. This ensures that the dataset is not biased towards any particular theme or community.
3. Essential annotation: The methodology uses a combination of manual and automatic annotation to ensure that the dataset is comprehensive and representative of different forms of offensive language.

1. Lack of previous work: There is a lack of previous work in irony generation, and no baselines to compare the model's performance.
2. Obscurity and hard to understand: Ironies can be obscure and hard to understand, making it difficult to decide which sentences are ironic and which are not.
3. Focus on detection rather than generation: Previous studies have focused more on irony detection rather than generation, leaving a gap in the field.
4. Emphasis on verbal irony: Most previous studies have focused on verbal irony, which is only one type of irony. Other types of irony, such as situational irony, are less well-studied.
5. Limited datasets: There are limited datasets available for irony generation, making it difficult to train and evaluate models.
6. Preserving sentiment polarity: Irony can be used to express stronger emotions, but it can also be used to obscure the true sentiment. Therefore, it is important to preserve the sentiment polarity when generating ironic sentences.
7. Inverted polarity: Ironic sentences often have an inverted polarity compared to the literal meaning, making it challenging to generate ironic sentences that still convey the intended meaning.
8. Lack of exploration in transformation: There is a lack of exploration in transforming non-ironic sentences into ironic ones, and vice versa.

This allows the model to represent multiple events in a document, rather than assuming that all words are generated from a single event.

In addition, the model uses a discriminator network to discriminate between the reconstructed documents and the original input documents, which helps the generator construct realistic documents by drawing random noise from a dirichlet distribution. The discriminator also provides low-dimensional discriminative features that can be used to visualize the documents and events.

Furthermore, the model does not assume that all words in a document are generated from a single event, but instead learns a distribution over multiple events. This allows the model to handle documents that describe multiple events, which is a common occurrence in news articles and other forms of text.

In contrast to other models, such as the Latent Event Model (LEM) and the Dirichlet Process Event Mixture Model (DPEM), which assume that all words in a document are generated from a single event, the AEM model is more flexible and can handle documents that describe multiple events. The AEM model also does not require a fixed number of events to be preset, as it can learn the number of events automatically from the data",0.089552237298953,0.0094339613652546,0.089552237298953,4.052513710896157e-08,6.012012968231419,4.95530831089031,0.1517427884615385,0.0100181430937919,0.519942581653595,0.5697504554698669,0.7445856928825378,0.7121095,0.0447798789820333,0.8,0.8224857172072332,0.8214299200305769

They argue that traditional evaluation metrics such as accuracy may not capture the model's performance in such situations, and instead propose using a framework that incorporates generalized expectation criteria and auxiliary regularization terms to formalize the distribution of output variables.

In particular, the authors focus on the problem of bias in prior knowledge, which can lead to undesirable performance in machine learning tasks. They suggest that incorporating prior knowledge into the model can improve its performance, but only if the prior knowledge is relevant and unbiased. If the prior knowledge is biased, the model may perform poorly or be overly sensitive to the bias.

To address this problem, the authors propose using a framework that includes three terms to make the model more robust:

1. Incorporating prior knowledge into the model through the use of feature words or phrases that are indicative of the class labels.
2. Using a regularization term to encourage the model to produce outputs that are diverse and not overly dependent on any single feature or prior knowledge.
3. Using a generalization expectation criterion to ensure that the model is able to generalize well to new, unseen data.

By incorporating these three terms, the authors claim that their proposed framework can make the model more robust and less sensitive to bias in prior knowledge",0.0657894714967105,0.0086206881513825,0.0657894714967105,8.952456833376273e-05,7.423638162219409,6.018415822903644,0.1603936406784161,0.0100195600974013,0.3067030310630798,0.3473416669584579,0.2306254506111145,0.70005226,0.0020222951385664,1.0,0.9122427978107192,0.8448501474482506

1. Firstly, they extract multiple relations from off-the-shelf open information extraction (OpenIE) toolboxes, such as OpenIE-2.0 and OpenIE-3.0.
2. They utilize these toolboxes to derive structured answer-relevant relations from unstructured sentences.
3. They carefully design heuristic rules to select the most relevant relations for the given context.
4. They employ these rules to select informative relations based on three criteria:
	* Descending importance: They prioritize relations that are most important for the given context.
	* Maximal number of overlapped tokens: They prefer relations with the maximum number of overlapped tokens between the answer and the context.
	* OpenIE containing maximum non-stop words: They select relations that contain the maximum number of non-stop words, which are words that are not separated by any punctuation.
5. They join the arguments extracted from nary relations in a sequence point context.
6. They represent the extracted relations in either triple or n-ary format, depending on the complexity of the sentence and the number of secondary arguments.
7. They use the selected informative relations to generate structured questions.

Specifically, they plan to ask ten human annotators to manually label under-translated input words for each input-hypothesis pair. The annotators should have at least six years of English study experience and their native language should be Chinese. They will then calculate the accuracy of detecting under-translation errors by comparing the words with the highest importance in the NMT outputs to the manually labeled under-translated words.

The authors also plan to use an attribution method to calculate the word importance, which they claim has consistently outperformed erasure and attention approaches. They suggest that this method can be used to identify under-translation errors automatically without the involvement of human interpreters.

Formally, let $x$ be the input sentence, $x'$ be the baseline input (which is a sequence of zero embeddings of the same length as $x$), $f$ be the well-trained NMT model, and $y$ be the output sentence. Let $x_n$ be the $n^{th}$ word of $x$ and $x_m$ be the $m^{th}$ word of $x'$. The contribution of $x_n$ to the prediction of $y$ at time step $n$ is defined as:

$$\frac{\partial f(y|x')}{\partial x_n} = \frac{\partial f(y|x')}{\partial x_m}$$

where $f(y|x')$ is the predicted output of the model given the input $x'$.

The integrated gradients are then defined as:

$$I(x_n, y) = \int_{0}^{n} \frac{\partial f(y|x')}{\partial x_m} dm$$

This integral is computed along a straight-line path from the baseline input $x'$ to the input $x$ at time step $n$. The integrated gradients give the contribution of each input word to the output sentence, and can be used to compute the importance of each input word.

The paper suggests using a baseline input $x'$ that is a sequence of zero embeddings of the same length as $x$ to simplify the computation of the integrated gradients. The baseline input $x'$ is used to compute the contribution of each input word to the prediction of the output sentence.

The formula for the contribution of $x_n$ to the prediction of $y$ at time step $n$ is:

$$C(x_n, y) = \frac{\partial f(y|x')}{\partial x_n} \cdot \frac{1}{n}$$

It is a variation of the standard scaled dot-product attention mechanism, which is widely used in transformer models.

Here's a high-level overview of how Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention works:

1. First, the input sequence is transformed into a set of vectors (called ""keys,"" ""values,"" and ""queries"") using a linear transformation.
2. Next, the queries, keys, and values are split into multiple segments, each of which is processed by a separate attention head.
3. Each attention head computes the attention weights for each segment by taking the dot product of the query and key vectors, and applying a softmax function to the results.
4. The attention weights are then used to compute a weighted sum of the value vectors, which forms the final output of the attention head.
5. To incorporate the Gaussian mask, the attention weights are computed using a Gaussian function that is applied to the dot product of the query and key vectors. The Gaussian function is used to mask the attention weights for positions that are too distant from the current position.
6. The output of each attention head is concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final output of the Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention mechanism.

In more detail, the Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention mechanism can be mathematically defined as follows:

1. First, the input sequence is transformed into a set of vectors (called ""keys,"" ""values,"" and ""queries"") using a linear transformation:

$$\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{W}_Q \mathbf{X}$$

$$\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{W}_K \mathbf{X}$$

$$\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{W}_V \mathbf{X}$$

where $\mathbf{X}$ is the input sequence, $\mathbf{W}_Q$, $\mathbf{W}_K$, and $\mathbf{W}_V$ are learned linear transformation matrices, and $\mathbf{Q}$, $\mathbf{K}$, and $\mathbf{V}$ are the query, key, and value vectors, respectively.

1. Misclassifications: The authors find that the model misclassifies tweets containing offensive words, such as ""nigga"" and ""faggot,"" as non-hate speech. This suggests that the model is able to capture some biases in the data annotation and collection process, as these words are often used as slurs to demean and degrade certain groups of people.
2. Disrespectful words: The authors note that the model tends to annotate many samples containing disrespectful words, such as ""coon"" and ""queer,"" as hate speech. This suggests that the model is able to capture some biases in the data annotation and collection process, as these words are often used as slurs to demean and degrade certain groups of people.
3. Geographic restriction: The authors find that the model oversamples tweets containing disparaging words in the United States, particularly in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This suggests that the model is able to capture some biases in the data collection process, as AAVE is often stigmatized and marginalized in the United States.
4. Social context: The authors note that the model tends to annotate tweets containing offensive words in certain social contexts, such as when the words are used to express anger or frustration, as hate speech. This suggests that the model is able to capture some biases in the data annotation and collection process, as certain social contexts may be more likely to be interpreted as hateful or offensive.
5. Dialect: The authors find that the model tends to annotate tweets written in certain dialects, such as AAVE, as hate speech. This suggests that the model is able to capture some biases in the data annotation and collection process, as certain dialects may be more likely to be stigmatized and marginalized.

Overall, the authors present several pieces of evidence that suggest the model can capture some biases in data annotation and collection, such as biases related to language use, geography, and social context.

208,Why is lemmatization not necessary in English?,['longstanding tradition field applying deep learning nlp tasks summarised follows minimal preprocessing possible . widely believed lemmatization text input normalisation necessary . advanced neural architectures based character input cnns bpe etc supposed able learn handle spelling morphology variations even languages rich morphology add layers . contextualised embedding models follow tradition rule trained raw text collections minimal linguistic preprocessing . show entirely true .'],['advanced neural architectures contextualized embedding models learn handle spelling morphology variations .'],"The statement ""lemmatization is not necessary in English"" is not entirely true. While it is true that English does not have a rich morphology like some other languages, lemmatization can still be useful in certain NLP tasks, especially when dealing with out-of-vocabulary words or words that have multiple inflectional forms.

Here are some reasons why lemmatization may not be necessary in English, but it can still be useful:

1. English has a relatively simple morphology: English words are typically formed by combining a root word with a suffix or prefix, and there are few inflectional endings. This means that the majority of words in English are in their base form, and there is less need for lemmatization.
2. English has a large vocabulary: English has a vast vocabulary, and most words are in their base form. This means that the majority of words do not need to be lemmatized, as they are already in their base form.
3. English uses a relatively consistent spelling system: English has a relatively consistent spelling system, which means that words are often spelled as they are pronounced. This reduces the need for lemmatization, as the spelling of the word is often a good indicator of its base form.
4. English has a well-defined word order: English has a well-defined word order, which means that the meaning of a sentence is determined more by the word order than by the individual words themselves. This reduces the need for lemmatization, as the word order can provide enough context to disambiguate the meaning of a sentence.

However, there are still some cases where lemmatization can be useful in English, such as:

1. Handling out-of-vocabulary words: If a word is not in the training data, it may not be recognized by a model that does not use lemmatization. Lemmatization can help to reduce the impact of out-of-vocabulary words by converting them to their base form, which may be more easily recognized by the model.
2. Dealing with words that have multiple inflectional forms: English has a number of words that have multiple inflectional forms, such as ""go"" (go, goes, going), ""have"" (have, has, had), and",0.0242424228936639,0.0,0.0242424228936639,9.072211426330239e-12,3.2303899684861554,2.498783713410601,0.0454545454545454,0.0099009900990099,0.2921347320079803,0.4825764408413793,0.6274418830871582,0.30640626,0.0076917780832603,0.2857142857142857,0.9537331310313162,0.7892888400193088

The architecture is based on a combination of a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network and a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) network.

In the semicharacter architecture, each input word is represented as a concatenation of one-hot vectors for its first and last characters, and a bag-of-characters representation for the internal characters. The BiLSTM network treats the first and last characters of each word individually, agnostic to the ordering of the internal characters. The word is then represented accordingly in the fed bidirectional LSTM cell, and the sequence is trained using a cross-entropy loss function.

The semicharacter architecture is proposed as a way to handle misspelled words in natural language processing tasks, as it can capture the internal structure of words and handle variations in word order and character sequences",0.1649484511382719,0.0132450315389677,0.1649484511382719,0.000593061471822,9.57688794196548,8.147971902567246,0.2182979947403024,0.0102803141561841,0.5288468599319458,0.4094524414051236,0.3454531729221344,0.57817304,0.0024306430239791,1.0,1.0000000000000002,0.8447815124665066

In the context of email spam detection, for example, spammers may intentionally misspell words to make their emails appear less suspicious to spam filters. By using adversarial training, the model can learn to recognize these subtle misspellings and improve its ability to detect spam emails.

Similarly, in the context of programmatic censorship, internet users may use misspellings to communicate surreptitiously. By training a model on adversarial examples of misspellings, it can learn to recognize these subtle variations and improve its ability to detect and block censored content.

The context mentions that the method achieves better potential analysis and learned internal mechanics, but it does not provide a direct comparison with baselines. However, it does mention that the method tends to have slightly higher BLEU scores than the baselines, especially when the input sequences are sparse.

Here are some possible baselines that could be compared with the method:

1. Softmax: The softmax baseline is a common comparison point for sequence-to-sequence models, including machine translation models. It represents the probability distribution over the target vocabulary, and it can be used to evaluate the performance of the model in terms of its ability to generate accurate and diverse translations.
2. Entmax: The entmax baseline is similar to the softmax baseline, but it uses the entropy of the target vocabulary to normalize the probability distribution. This can help to evaluate the performance of the model in terms of its ability to generate diverse translations.
3. Random: A random baseline can be used to evaluate the performance of the model in terms of its ability to generate coherent and fluent translations. This baseline can be implemented by randomly selecting a translation from the target vocabulary for each input sequence.
4. Pre-trained models: Pre-trained machine translation models, such as those based on transformer architectures, can be used as baselines to evaluate the performance of the method. These models have been pre-trained on large datasets and have achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of machine translation tasks.

In terms of the specific results mentioned in the context, the method achieves better BLEU scores than the baselines on the IWSLT De-En and WMT Ro-En tasks, but the improvement is not significant. However, the method does achieve higher BLEU scores than the baselines on the WMT En-De task, which suggests that it may be more effective for this specific task",0.0361445766693279,0.0,0.0361445766693279,0.0051045814250645,6.566716860836914,5.834848289621259,0.2439377802450689,0.0100212572122684,0.5606458187103271,0.0,0.3211629688739776,0.6252795,0.006587605402668,1.0,0.8998936239017254,0.8286980945829964

1. Use of monolingual data: The authors propose using monolingual data to improve the performance of the NMT framework, which is much cheaper and more readily available than parallel data.
2. Modified copy target: Instead of using the full back-translation (BT) technique, the authors propose using a modified copy target, which is a significantly cheaper and more efficient method.
3. Use of GANs: The authors propose using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate high-quality pseudosource sentences that are closer to natural source sentences. GANs are a more efficient and cost-effective solution compared to traditional data generation methods.
4. Efficient solution: The authors propose an efficient solution for domain adaptation using the proposed techniques, which can be implemented with less computational resources and time compared to traditional methods.

1. Organic way: This refers to changing one's profile attributes in an organic and genuine manner, without any external influence or pressure. For example, users may change their profile name or bio to reflect their political beliefs or affiliations, or they may add a political party's name or logo to their profile. This type of change is considered organic because it reflects the user's genuine interest or support for a particular political party or leader.
2. Inorganic way: This refers to changing one's profile attributes in a way that is not genuine or natural, but rather as a result of external pressure or influence. For example, if a political leader or party encourages their followers to change their profile attributes to show support, this may be considered an inorganic way of showing political affiliation. Similarly, if users change their profile attributes to follow a trend or to gain attention, this may also be considered inorganic behavior.

The text suggests that the chowkidar movement, which involved changing Twitter profiles to include the word ""chowkidar"" in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call, was an inorganic way of showing political affiliation. The movement was coordinated by political leaders and parties, and many users updated their profiles in response to the call, even if they did not genuinely support the cause. This type of behavior is considered inorganic because it is driven by external pressure rather than genuine interest or belief",0.1273885317116314,0.030769227856805,0.1273885317116314,0.1181348076965612,21.62728254734144,17.927318702914803,0.2714921146618684,0.0104294982343762,0.591230034828186,0.482672290719611,0.4993132650852203,0.7858403,0.0309591498892436,1.0,0.954362219246817,0.89579151255278

1. Influential leads are more likely to engage in profile changes: The first sentence of the context states that ""insight political handles likely engage in profile changing behavior compared to followers."" This suggests that influential leads are more likely to make changes to their profiles, such as changing their usernames, location, or profile images, compared to their followers.
2. Influential leads are more likely to change their usernames: The second sentence of the context states that ""figure [figref] plot number changes given attributes snapshots users set s. plot find attributes modified equal rate."" This suggests that influential leads are more likely to change their usernames compared to their followers.
3. Influential leads are more likely to change their profile images: The third sentence of the context states that ""profile image location changed profile attributes account nearly respectively total profile changes dataset."" This suggests that influential leads are more likely to change their profile images compared to their followers.
4. Influential leads tend to make new changes related to previous attribute values: The fourth sentence of the context states that ""insight political handles tend to make new changes related to previous attribute values."" This suggests that influential leads are more likely to make changes that are related to their previous attribute values, such as changing their username to a similar name or changing their profile image to a related image.
5. Followers make less related changes to their profiles: The fifth sentence of the context states that ""followers make comparatively less related changes to previous attribute values."" This suggests that followers are less likely to make changes that are related to their previous attribute values compared to influential leads.
6. Influential leads are more likely to lose their verified status: The sixth sentence of the context states that ""likely reason follow handles verified would loose verified status changing username."" This suggests that influential leads are more likely to lose their verified status if they change their username.

2. The dataset includes case documents from the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China, which has made the documents publicly available.
3. The dataset contains both granted and rejected pleas, with a total of 10,000 inlineform cases.

5. The dataset also includes relevant law articles, with an average of 10-20 inlineform tokens per article.

1. Global outlier score: This measures the degree to which a user's tweet content is related to a certain topic compared to other users. Specifically, the global outlier score for user topic k is calculated using the following equation:

goss_score_uk = (1/n) \* ∑ (xi_k - x_bar_k)^2

where xi_k is the likelihood of the ith tweet account favoring the kth topic, x_bar_k is the average likelihood of all users favoring the kth topic, and n is the total number of users.
2. Local outlier score: This measures the degree of interest someone shows in a certain topic considering their homepage content. The local outlier score for an account's topic k is calculated using the following equation:

loss_score_uk = (1/n) \* ∑ (xi_k - x_bar_k)^2

where xi_k is the likelihood of the ith tweet account favoring the kth topic, x_bar_k is the average likelihood of all users favoring the kth topic, and n is the total number of users.
3. Combination of global and local outlier scores: The authors combine the global and local outlier scores to detect spammers. They use a combination of the two scores to calculate a single score for each account, which is then used to classify the account as spam or non-spam.

1. First, they apply multiple CNN-RNN models to a sentence test set, as presented in tables TabRef and TabRef.
2. Each model predicts a class vote for each sentence, which represents the probability of the sentence belonging to a particular class.
3. In case of a tie (i.e., multiple classes have the same probability of being the correct class), they pick one of the frequent classes randomly.
4. The combination of the class votes from all the models achieves an F-score, which is a measure of the performance of the combination.
5. The authors confirm that the combination of two NN types (CNN and RNN) achieves better performance than each type alone, indicating that the networks provide complementary information.
6. The RNN computes a weighted combination of the words in a sentence, while the CNN extracts informative n-grams and considers the resulting activations.

In summary, the simple voting scheme involves applying multiple CNN-RNN models to a sentence test set, combining their class votes using a weighted average, and picking one of the frequent classes in case of a tie.

Unordered text documents are common in many real-world corpora, such as news articles, social media posts, and web pages. These documents often contain a mixture of sentences, paragraphs, and other text elements that are not organized in a specific order.

In contrast to structured documents, unordered text documents can be challenging to process and analyze using traditional document processing techniques. This is because the lack of structure makes it difficult to identify the main topics, key points, and other important information in the document.

However, unordered text documents are essential in many applications, such as text summarization, question answering, and information retrieval. For example, in text summarization, the goal is to automatically generate a summary of the main points in an unordered text document, while in question answering, the goal is to extract the relevant information from an unordered text document to answer a specific question.

To address the challenges of processing unordered text documents, researchers have developed various techniques, such as clustering-based methods, to group similar sentences together and identify the main topics in the document.

Based on the provided context, here's the answer to your question:

The data was collected through a series of pilot studies and crowdsourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).

First, the researchers conducted a series of pilot studies to collect commonsense inference questions. These pilot studies involved asking human participants to generate questions that required common sense to answer. The researchers then used these questions to collect answers from human participants.

Next, the researchers used MTurk to collect texts and answers for the machine comprehension task. They created a dataset of over 10,000 questions and answers, which were annotated with the corresponding texts. The annotated dataset was then split into training, validation, and test sets.

The researchers used MTurk to collect the texts and answers because it provides a large pool of potential workers who can complete tasks quickly and efficiently. Additionally, MTurk allows for easy data collection and annotation, as well as the ability to pay workers for their participation.

After collecting the data, the researchers performed post-processing steps to validate the dataset and ensure its quality. These steps included filtering out low-quality answers, removing duplicates, and correcting errors. The final dataset consisted of over 10,000 questions and answers, which were used to train and evaluate the machine comprehension models",0.210526312465374,0.0462962937722909,0.1973684177285319,0.0393752166909232,16.131101089215807,13.574843871810954,0.3124547069271759,0.0104917706727661,0.7048094868659973,1.0,0.80015629529953,0.6218821,0.0034335077310083,1.0,0.8979675144382239,0.9157337272109832

Here are some basic neural network architectures that are commonly used for classification tasks and their strengths and weaknesses:

1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs): This is the simplest form of a neural network, where the data flows only in one direction, from input layer to output layer, without any feedback loops. FNNs are easy to implement and train, but they can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, where the gradients become smaller as they propagate through the network, making it difficult to train deep networks.

Strengths: Easy to implement and train, can handle simple classification tasks.

Weaknesses: Can suffer from vanishing gradient problem, limited ability to handle complex tasks.

2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): These are specialized neural networks for image and signal processing tasks. They use convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from images and other signals. CNNs are particularly effective for image classification tasks, object detection, and image segmentation.

Strengths: Excellent for image and signal processing tasks, can learn spatial hierarchies of features, can handle large datasets.

Weaknesses: Require a large amount of labeled training data, can be computationally expensive to train and test.

3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): These are neural networks that have feedback connections, which allow the data to flow in a loop. This allows the network to capture temporal dependencies in the data, making it particularly useful for sequential data such as speech, text, or time series data.

Strengths: Excellent for sequential data, can capture temporal dependencies, can handle long-term dependencies.

Weaknesses: Can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, can be difficult to train, require a large amount of training data.

4. Support Vector Machines (SVMs): These are a type of kernel-based machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs aim to find the hyperplane that maximally separates the classes in the feature space.

Strengths: Can handle high-dimensional data",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0850686990898664,0.0638015243173998,0.0,0.0099009900990099,0.0279483031481504,1.0,1.0,Error,0.0150656169220417,,0.8703632871455462,0.7149288469243547

It is a type of multisensory integration, where the brain combines information from multiple senses (in this case, vision and hearing) to form a unified perception of the world.

The McGurk effect is characterized by the fact that when a person watches a video of someone saying a word, but the audio is altered so that the word is not what the person is saying, the viewer will still perceive the word that is being said, rather than the actual audio. This is because the brain is using the visual information to override the audio information, leading to an illusory perception of the word.

For example, if a person watches a video of someone saying ""baa"" but the audio is altered so that it sounds like ""gaa"", many people will still perceive the person as saying ""baa"" because the visual information is more influential than the audio information. This effect can be seen in a variety of languages and is thought to be due to the way that the brain processes multisensory information.

The McGurk effect has been studied extensively in psychology and neuroscience, and has important implications for our understanding of how the brain processes sensory information and how it forms perceptions of the world",0.0312499976965333,0.0,0.0312499976965333,6.427334357973804e-05,7.053926870041025,5.535354733890858,0.1378524945770065,0.0099436098316904,0.514358639717102,0.7801853607571314,0.5697718858718872,0.61785007,0.0409453973818341,1.0,1.0,0.8393575024514919

In the biomedical domain, NER is particularly challenging due to the complexity of the language, the variety of entities, and the lack of standardization in the way entities are referred to in text. Additionally, the biomedical domain has its own set of ontologies and terminologies that need to be considered when performing NER.

Compared to NER in general text, NER in the biomedical domain has additional challenges such as dealing with domain-specific terminology, handling ambiguity and uncertainty, and extracting information from unstructured text.

It is defined as the inverse of the pseudolikelihood, which is a surrogate for the true likelihood of the model.

More specifically, pseudo-perplexity is defined as:

pseudo-perplexity = 1 / pseudolikelihood

where the pseudolikelihood is a function of the model's parameters and the input sequence. The pseudolikelihood is typically defined as the product of the conditional probabilities of each token in the sequence, given the previous tokens.

The pseudo-perplexity score is used as a substitute for the true perplexity score, which is difficult to compute for long sequences. The pseudo-perplexity score is a more tractable measure that can be used to evaluate the performance of the language model.

The context also mentions that there are different types of approximations that have been previously explored, such as bidirectional RNN LMs and deep transformer models. Therefore, the definition of pseudo-perplexity may vary depending on the specific model and the approximation method used",0.0754716961053756,0.0,0.0754716961053756,5.027017204223456e-05,7.877557344229581,6.242636436445778,0.09375,0.009959337615652,0.4335248172283172,0.6577989575774069,0.4888608157634735,0.6281229,0.0162087614925595,0.7142857142857143,0.975008741748072,0.7912867268091601

In the context of results analysis, quantitative analysis is used to examine the numerical data collected during a study or experiment. This type of analysis is useful for identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

Some common quantitative analysis techniques used in results analysis include:

1. Descriptive statistics: This involves calculating summary statistics such as means, medians, and standard deviations to describe the main features of the data.
2. Inferential statistics: This involves using statistical tests to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data.
3. Correlation analysis: This involves examining the strength and direction of the relationship between two or more variables.
4. Regression analysis: This involves modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
5. Hypothesis testing: This involves testing a hypothesis about a population based on a sample of data.
6. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): This involves comparing the means of two or more groups to determine if there are significant differences between them.
7. Non-parametric tests: These are statistical tests that do not assume normality of the data, such as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the Kruskal-Wallis test.
8. Time series analysis: This involves examining data that is collected over time to identify patterns and trends.
9. Survival analysis: This involves analyzing data on the time it takes for a particular event to occur, such as the time until failure of a product or the time until dropout from a study.

These embeddings are learned using unsupervised methods, such as graph attention networks and self-attention mechanisms.

Additionally, the context mentions that the pretraining procedures are modified from the original pretraining tasks, such as masked language model tasks, next sentence prediction tasks, and self-prediction tasks. These tasks are typically unsupervised, and the goal is to learn a representation of the input sequence that can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks.

Here are some potential directions for future work:

1. Auxiliary structural tasks: The paper mentions that adding auxiliary structural tasks, such as predicting the number of medications or the dosage of medications, could improve the ability of the model to represent medical codes. This could be explored in future work to further enhance the performance of the G-BERT model.
2. Larger datasets and heterogeneous modalities: The paper notes that the G-BERT model outperforms baselines on the medication recommendation task, but it is not clear how well the model would perform on larger datasets or with heterogeneous modalities. Adapting the model to these settings could potentially improve its performance and expand its applicability to other healthcare tasks.
3. Multi-task learning: Another direction for future work could be to explore multi-task learning with the G-BERT model, where the model is trained on multiple tasks simultaneously. This could potentially improve the performance of the model on each task, as well as improve its ability to represent medical codes.
4. Transfer learning: The G-BERT model could also be used as a starting point for transfer learning in other healthcare tasks. For example, the model could be fine-tuned on a different task, such as disease diagnosis or patient outcome prediction, to adapt it to that task.

1. Gating mechanism: The proposed model uses a gating mechanism to selectively focus on certain parts of the input when generating the output. This helps to prevent undesirable semantic repetitions and improve the diversity of the generated sentences.
2. Adaptation to new domains: The proposed model is designed to adapt to new domains by leveraging out-of-domain data. This is achieved through the use of a learnable gate mechanism that can selectively focus on different parts of the input when generating the output.
3. Joint training: The proposed model is trained jointly on sentence planning and surface realization, which allows it to learn the relationships between the two tasks and produce more natural language sentences.
4. LSTM-based decoder: The proposed model uses an LSTM-based decoder, which is able to capture long-term dependencies in the input sequence and generate more coherent and natural language sentences.
5. Refinement and adjustment: The proposed model includes an LSTM-based component that refines and adjusts the output of the decoder, allowing it to produce more accurate and natural language sentences.

1. Mean Opinion Score (MOS): This is a subjective metric that evaluates the quality of converted audio by asking two questions about the naturalness and similarity of the converted version to the original audio.
2. Automatic evaluation score: This method uses a score roughly based on the design of the bibref, which employs a pitch tracker library (librosa package) to extract pitch information from input and output audio. The score is based on the normalized cross-correlation between the input and output pitch, with higher scores indicating better matching between the input and output pitch.
3. Human evaluation score: This method involves evaluating the quality of the converted audio using human listeners, who are asked to rate the quality of the audio on a scale from 1 to 5. The scores are then averaged to obtain a mean opinion score (MOS).
4. Conversion reconstruction tasks: This method involves evaluating the quality of the converted audio by comparing it to the original audio, and assessing how well the converted audio matches the original audio in terms of pitch, naturalness, and similarity.

They mention that the system is trained on one type of data, either labeled by experts or routed through a crowd of annotators, depending on the predicted difficulty of the instances. The authors present results that show that using a mix of expert and crowd annotations can be beneficial, with respective tradeoffs in precision and recall.

To match annotators to instances, the authors likely use a combination of techniques such as:

1. Random assignment: Each instance is randomly assigned to an annotator, either an expert or a member of the crowd.
2. Skill-based assignment: Instances are assigned to annotators based on their skills and expertise. For example, more difficult instances may be assigned to expert annotators, while simpler instances may be assigned to crowd annotators.
3. Cost-based assignment: Instances are assigned to annotators based on their cost or availability. For example, expert annotators may be more expensive to use, so they may be assigned to more difficult instances, while crowd annotators may be less expensive and assigned to simpler instances.
4. Active learning: The system actively selects instances that are most likely to benefit from expert annotation and assigns them to expert annotators. The remaining instances are assigned to crowd annotators.

By matching annotators to instances in this way, the authors can evaluate the performance of the system using a mix of expert and crowd annotations, and compare it to the performance of the system using only expert annotations or only crowd annotations",0.0155038750820263,0.0,0.0155038750820263,2.3637101138949782e-14,1.8930039412532784,1.470321909720144,0.0386597938144329,0.0099009900990099,0.4986628293991089,0.5440535006069002,0.4149959683418274,0.78073967,0.0040709764489241,0.8,0.9504770036405724,0.7742045375218641

The core idea of the message passing framework is to iteratively update the representations of vertices in a graph based on messages received from their neighboring vertices.

In the context of GNNs, a graph is represented as a set of vertices and edges, where each vertex represents a node in the graph and each edge represents a connection between two nodes. The message passing framework formalizes the process of propagating information between nodes in a graph. Each node receives a message from its neighboring nodes and updates its own representation based on the messages it receives. This process is repeated for multiple iterations, allowing the network to capture complex patterns and relationships in the graph.

The message passing framework has been applied to a variety of tasks, including node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. However, most studies have focused on applying the framework to text representation learning, and the paper proposes a new application of the framework for precisely representing documents in word cooccurrence networks. The proposed architecture is called the Multi-layer Perceptron (MP) GNN with Attention Network (MPAD), which combines the message passing framework with attention mechanisms to improve the expressiveness of the model.

The paper proposes a transformer-based model to train neural network models that predict the polarity of an event given the event and its context. The model is trained on a large corpus of text data, and it learns to propagate polarity seed predicates and classify extracted event pairs based on the availability of discourse relations. The model is expected to automatically learn complex phenomena and label propagation",0.0550458693207643,0.0,0.0550458693207643,0.0006550126508826,11.220524056013929,9.028219370313796,0.1742919389978213,0.010149733695106,0.3763367831707001,0.0,0.3416822552680969,0.48006022,0.0091318564407009,1.0,0.8600770585858407,0.8768972955430792
347,How big are improvements of supervszed learning results trained on smalled labeled data enhanced with proposed approach copared to basic approach?,['float selected table results small labeled training data . given performance full dataset show bert trained al data .'],[''],"Based on the context, it seems that the proposed approach is a method for enhancing the performance of supervised learning models using small labeled data, and the basic approach is a standard supervised learning method. To answer the question, we need to compare the performance of the proposed approach with the basic approach on the same dataset.

Here are some possible improvements that the proposed approach could bring compared to the basic approach:

1. Improved accuracy: By using a small labeled dataset and the proposed approach, the model may be able to learn more accurately from the limited training data. This could lead to improved test accuracy compared to the basic approach.
2. Reduced overfitting: The proposed approach may help reduce overfitting by using a smaller labeled dataset and incorporating unlabeled data. This could lead to better generalization performance compared to the basic approach.
3. Improved efficiency: The proposed approach may be more computationally efficient than the basic approach, as it uses a smaller labeled dataset and can leverage pre-trained language models like BERT. This could lead to faster training times and improved scalability.

To quantify these improvements, we could compare the performance of the proposed approach with the basic approach on a full dataset. We could use metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, or AUC-ROC to evaluate the performance.

For example, if the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 90% on a full dataset, while the basic approach achieves an accuracy of 80%, then the proposed approach has an improvement of 10% in accuracy. Similarly, if the proposed approach achieves an F1 score of 0.85 on a full dataset, while the basic approach achieves an F1 score of 0.75, then the proposed approach has an improvement of 0.10 in F1 score.

Overall, the improvements brought by the proposed approach will depend on the specific dataset and the performance of the basic approach. However, by using a small labeled dataset and incorporating unlabeled data, the proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of supervised learning models in natural language processing tasks",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0099009900990099,0.091102510690689,0.0,0.7851265668869019,Error,0.1796325013061319,,0.8579358335462254,0.6841032149867279

Their approach leverages discourse relations to efficiently propagate polarity information from seed predicates to other events in the text.

The key idea is to exploit the fact that the polarity of an event is often determined by the polarity of the discourse relations that connect it to other events in the text. For example, if an event is described as causing another event, the polarity of the first event is likely to be positive, while the polarity of the second event is likely to be negative.

The authors use a seed lexicon to identify seed predicates that are known to have a positive or negative polarity. They then use these seed predicates to propagate polarity information to other events in the text. For example, if a seed predicate is known to have a positive polarity, the authors assume that any event that is connected to the seed predicate by a positive discourse relation is also likely to have a positive polarity.

The authors also use a heuristic to exempt counterexamples, which are events that are known to have a negative polarity despite being connected to a positive seed predicate. This heuristic is based on the observation that certain words or phrases are more likely to be used in a negative context, even if they are connected to a positive seed predicate.

To train their model, the authors use a large raw corpus of text and transform the idea of polarity propagation into an objective function that can be optimized using neural network models. The objective function takes as input a set of events and outputs a prediction of the polarity of each event. The model is trained to minimize the difference between the predicted polarity and the true polarity of each event.

Overall, the authors' approach to learning affective events using mostly raw data is based on the idea of leveraging discourse relations to efficiently propagate polarity information from seed predicates to other events in the text. By using a small seed lexicon and a large raw corpus, their method can be applied to a wide range of texts and can learn to recognize affective events with high accuracy",0.0784313713272673,0.0215827331864292,0.0784313713272673,7.01773940241712e-14,4.152059877065466,3.458844276733372,0.1017268164435946,0.0099525819394507,0.7657086849212646,0.7362370416522026,0.1930900514125824,0.67899877,0.0055304746669905,1.0,0.7991449994503803,0.8782298540870467

Here are some key observations:

1. Dynamic communities: These communities exhibit higher monthly user retention rates compared to generic communities. This suggests that dynamic communities, such as those focused on popular video games like Starcraft, provide a continual stream of novel content that keeps users engaged and motivated to continue participating.
2. Distinctive communities: Communities with a strong sense of distinctiveness, such as those focused on niche topics like cooking or Naruto, exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates compared to generic communities. This suggests that users are more likely to stay engaged with communities that offer a unique and distinctive experience.
3. Community points: The computed community points for both dynamic and distinctive communities are higher compared to generic communities. This suggests that users are more likely to participate and engage in communities that offer a sense of progression and achievement.
4. User retention: Monthly retention is strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content. This suggests that communities that offer a steady stream of new content are more likely to retain users over time.
5. Relationship between dynamicity and distinctiveness: There is an interesting relationship between dynamicity and distinctiveness. Communities that are highly distinctive, such as those focused on random acts of makeup, may generate focused commitment from users in the short term, but may not retain users over longer periods of time unless they also provide sufficient dynamic content.

Overall, the study suggests that different types of communities may exhibit different social phenomena, and that community managers should consider these factors when designing and maintaining their communities. For example, dynamic communities may benefit from providing a continual stream of novel content, while distinctive communities may benefit from offering a unique and distinctive experience",0.2399999967405,0.1023890756230125,0.2299999967405,0.2030856884184322,19.918382267755387,17.27314102349597,0.3285224551039921,0.0105836522218774,0.7559433579444885,0.8817204301075269,0.7397185564041138,0.87961805,0.0731517582036949,1.0,0.9452645504902653,0.9191239136993208

The dataset also includes history data for each subreddit, and the authors manually removed communities with bulk contributions in foreign languages.

To select the 300 Reddit communities for comparison, the authors likely followed these steps:

1. Filtered out subreddits with low activity: The authors may have filtered out subreddits that were not sufficiently active over the past month, based on criteria such as the number of comments, posts, or users.
2. Removed subreddits with foreign language contributions: The authors manually removed subreddits with bulk contributions in foreign languages, as mentioned in the text.
3. Selected subreddits with diverse topics: The authors may have selected subreddits with diverse topics to ensure that the comparison is representative of different communities and interests.

1. Accuracy: This is the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances in the test dataset. It is calculated as the sum of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided by the total number of instances in the test dataset.
2. Macro F-score: This is a measure of the model's performance that takes into account both precision and recall. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it is calculated as the average of the macro F-score for each class.
3. Averaged F-score: This is similar to the macro F-score, but it is calculated for each class separately and then averaged across all classes.
4. Positive and Negative Classes: These are the classes that the model is trying to predict. In this case, the positive classes are the classes that are being compared to the reference lexicon, and the negative classes are the classes that are not being compared to the reference lexicon.
5. Drift Weighting: This is a measure of how well the model performs on new, unseen data. It is calculated by comparing the model's performance on the test dataset to its performance on a separate validation dataset.

1. Learning Engine: The learning engine is a classifier that is trained on a limited set of labeled data to perform a specific task, such as text classification or sentiment analysis. The learning engine is the main component that is improved through active learning.
2. Selection Engine: The selection engine is responsible for selecting the most informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled data. The selection engine uses a sampling strategy, such as uncertainty sampling or query-by-committee, to choose the samples that are most likely to benefit the learning engine.

The selection engine works as follows:

a. Unlabeled Data: The selection engine starts with a large pool of unlabeled data.

b. Sampling Strategy: The selection engine applies a sampling strategy to the unlabeled data to choose a subset of samples that are most informative for the learning engine. The sampling strategy is based on the uncertainty of the learning engine's predictions or the diversity of the samples.

c. Relabeling: The selected samples are then relabeled by human annotators, who provide the correct labels for the samples.

d. Training: The learning engine is trained on the relabeled samples, which improves its accuracy over time.

e. Retraining: The selection engine continuously selects new samples, relabels them, and retrain the learning engine to improve its accuracy.

The key advantage of active learning is that it can achieve the same level of accuracy as supervised learning with a much smaller amount of labeled data. By selectively choosing the most informative samples, active learning can reduce the labeling effort required for training a classifier.

In the context of the paper, the authors employed a CRF-based segmenter as the learning engine and a sampling strategy based on uncertainty sampling to select the most informative samples for relabeling. The selection engine was used to continuously improve the accuracy of the segmenter by selecting the most uncertain samples for relabeling",0.2011173154283574,0.0198675473707296,0.1452513936406479,0.0061982680498668,15.358279850649565,13.054552508023828,0.2938675470188076,0.0104072670396438,0.5625316500663757,0.7142857142857143,0.2914851307868957,0.71467024,0.0158244021989631,1.0,0.9019982073662824,0.9093738386141644

According to the text, the annotators agreed on at least one person in the majority of the pairs (checked agreement data using Fleiss kappa bibref, results shown in figure), with a percentage of 83.6% for the total stories scenarios. This indicates that the annotators had a good agreement on the annotation task.

Moreover, the text states that the annotators had a better evaluation for the labeled instances, including also unrelated and related nonscript events, which suggests that they were able to accurately identify the central script event and its relationships with other events in the text.

However, the text also mentions that one of the challenges of the annotation task was that many cases were difficult to decide whether a particular event was considered central script event or loosely related/unrelated script event, which suggests that there was some level of subjectivity and complexity in the task",0.1848739465659205,0.034682078058071,0.1848739465659205,0.2061319206665806,16.553623177543905,14.176537382951963,0.2435378934411816,0.0105132962275819,0.5380911827087402,0.5808899605640703,0.5294186770915985,0.48402482,0.0234455984696717,0.7142857142857143,0.9022614515906136,0.8713555239097592

To answer your question, we would need to know more about the specific evaluation metric and datasets being used, as well as the details of the two methods being compared.

Without this information, it is difficult to provide a meaningful answer to your question. However, I can offer some general guidance on how to evaluate the performance difference between two methods.

One common approach is to use a statistical test, such as a t-test or ANOVA, to compare the means of the two methods. This can help you determine whether the difference between the methods is statistically significant, and how large the difference is.

Another approach is to use a confidence interval, such as a 95% confidence interval, to estimate the range of possible differences between the two methods. This can help you determine whether the difference between the methods is likely to be practically significant.

It is also important to consider the context and goals of your analysis, as well as any potential sources of bias or error. For example, if the two methods are being compared on different datasets, you may need to adjust for any differences in the datasets or use techniques such as cross-validation to ensure that the comparison is fair.

In summary, the performance difference between the floating table compare model and the baseline method will depend on the specifics of the comparison, and it is important to carefully consider the evaluation metric, datasets, and other factors when making a comparison",0.0139860125658957,0.0,0.0139860125658957,1.8540646972172944e-06,3.7670664286849767,3.0270883049683475,0.1134020618556701,0.0099009900990099,0.2951890230178833,0.5574912891986062,0.9191778898239136,0.7125391,0.1431615942971313,1.0,0.0,0.7701272979529179

1. Noisy nature of Twitter data: Twitter data is known to be noisy, with many tweets containing URLs, user mentions, hashtags, emoticons, and other forms of non-standard text that can make sentiment analysis more challenging.
2. Informal language and slang: Twitter users often use informal language, slang, and new words that are not present in formal dictionaries, which can make it difficult for sentiment analysis algorithms to accurately identify the sentiment of tweets.
3. Creativity in spelling and punctuation: Twitter users may intentionally misspell words or use non-standard punctuation to convey their message, which can lead to errors in sentiment analysis.
4. Length limitations: Twitter messages are generally short, which can make it difficult to capture the full context of a sentence or phrase and accurately determine its sentiment.
5. Genre differences: Twitter has its own unique genre of language that is different from other forms of text, such as newswire articles or formal documents. This difference in genre can make it challenging to apply sentiment analysis techniques that are designed for other domains.
6. Amplifiers and diminishers: Twitter has its own set of amplifiers and diminishers, such as ""RT"" (retweet) and ""@"" (at symbol), which can make it difficult to accurately identify the sentiment of a tweet.
7. Negation scope detection: Twitter users may use negation words or phrases, such as ""not"" or ""no,"" which can make it challenging to determine the true sentiment of a tweet.
8. Detection of URLs, user mentions, and hashtags: These elements can be challenging to detect and extract from tweets, especially if they are embedded in the text or contain special characters.

To overcome these challenges, researchers have developed various techniques and tools specific to Twitter, such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and syntactic parsing.

There are several ways to represent possible sentence transformations in a dataset, depending on the specific goals and requirements of the project. Here are a few possible approaches:

1. As new sentences: One approach is to represent possible sentence transformations as new sentences in the dataset. For example, if the seed sentence is ""The cat sat on the mat,"" a possible sentence transformation could be ""The dog sat on the mat."" This approach would involve creating a new sentence for each possible transformation, which could result in a large number of sentences in the dataset.
2. As sentence fragments: Another approach is to represent possible sentence transformations as sentence fragments, rather than full sentences. For example, if the seed sentence is ""The cat sat on the mat,"" a possible sentence transformation could be ""The cat sat on the."" This approach would involve creating a new sentence fragment for each possible transformation, which could be more efficient than creating a full sentence for each transformation.
3. As paraphrases: A third approach is to represent possible sentence transformations as paraphrases of the original seed sentence. For example, if the seed sentence is ""The cat sat on the mat,"" a possible sentence transformation could be ""The feline sat on the doormat."" This approach would involve creating a new paraphrase for each possible transformation, which could provide more variation in the dataset.
4. As semantic variations: Another approach is to represent possible sentence transformations as semantic variations of the original seed sentence. For example, if the seed sentence is ""The cat sat on the mat,"" a possible sentence transformation could be ""The cat perched on the rug."" This approach would involve creating a new sentence that conveys the same meaning as the original seed sentence, but with a different wording.

Regardless of the approach used, it is important to ensure that the dataset is well-annotated and that the annotations are consistent and reliable. This can involve using multiple annotators and checking their work for accuracy and consistency. Additionally, it may be helpful to include statistics for each annotator to ensure that their annotations are reliable and representative of the overall dataset",0.0285714280163265,0.0082987549408584,0.0285714280163265,1.8060195449787604e-27,0.698243227583335,0.6276347558845801,0.0287907869481765,0.0099256200402995,0.332086831331253,0.5175786820848783,0.5963283777236938,0.6410665,0.0090767312185627,0.0,0.9743396345521256,0.761191765192422

They report the accuracy of each experiment in the form of ""w represents lines marked experiments results kobayashikobayashi.""

More specifically, the authors use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the classifiers:

1. Accuracy: This is the most common metric used to evaluate the performance of a classifier. It measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all the instances in the test dataset.
2. F1-score: This metric is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a balanced measure of both. It is useful when the classes are imbalanced, and one class has a significantly larger number of instances than the other.
3. AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve): This metric measures the ability of a classifier to distinguish between positive and negative classes. A higher AUC-ROC indicates better performance.

The authors use these metrics to compare the performance of different classifier architectures and methods on various benchmark datasets.

Here's how it works:

1. Lexicon creation: The framework starts by creating a weighted lexicon of terms that are commonly used by Facebook users in their shared status updates. The weight of each term is determined by its frequency of use in the dataset.
2. Predictive power evaluation: The framework evaluates the predictive power of the lexicon terms in predicting demographic information such as age and gender. This is done by using a dataset of Facebook users' shared status updates and predicting the age and gender of the users based on the lexicon terms they use.
3. Two weighted lexicon terms: The framework utilizes two weighted lexicon terms to predict demographic information. One term is used to predict age, and the other term is used to predict gender.
4. Inlineform equation: The framework uses an inlineform equation to represent the frequency of each term in the lexicon. The inlineform equation measures the total word count of each term in the lexicon and represents the frequency of each term as a weighted value.
5. Data bias: The framework acknowledges that the dataset may be biased toward young people, and it reports the age prediction performance for each age group separately in a table (tabref).
6. Model building: The framework builds a balanced dataset by keeping the number of users in each age range. It also measures the average accuracy of the model in predicting the demographic information for both age and gender.
7. Depressed users: The framework also considers a control class of depressed users to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting demographic information for this group.
8. Groundtruth dataset: The framework uses a groundtruth dataset to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting demographic information.

Overall, the framework facilitates demographic inference from social media by using a weighted lexicon of terms to predict demographic information such as age and gender.

Here's a breakdown of the steps they describe:

1. Identify a set of seed words that are morally relevant, such as ""justice,"" ""fairness,"" ""rights,"" etc.
2. Collect emotional valence ratings for a set of English words, where the ratings are approximations of the degree of pleasantness or unpleasantness that the words elicit.
3. Use the seed words to identify a set of morally relevant words that are similar in meaning to the seed words, but are not necessarily identical. This set of words is referred to as the ""morfically relevant"" set.
4. Use the emotional valence ratings to calculate the average valence rating for the morally relevant set of words.
5. Use the average valence rating as a baseline to compare the valence ratings of other words in the language. Words with valence ratings that are closer to the average rating are considered to be more morally relevant, while words with valence ratings that are further away from the average rating are considered to be less morally relevant.
6. To approximiate moral irrelevance, the authors use a set of words with neutral valence ratings, such as ""the,"" ""a,"" ""an,"" etc. These words are not morally relevant, and their valence ratings are close to the average rating.
7. The authors then create a set of morally irrelevant words by selecting a total number of words that is equal to the number of morally relevant words, and assigning them neutral valence ratings. This set of words is referred to as the ""morfically irrelevant"" set.

By comparing the valence ratings of the morally relevant and morally irrelevant sets of words, the authors can quantify the degree of moral relevance for each word in the language. This approach allows them to identify words that are more or less morally relevant, and to study the relationship between morality and language in a more systematic way",0.087591239522617,0.0240963846976661,0.087591239522617,1.7179520519799755e-10,4.658795269825527,4.030004608608158,0.1031894934333959,0.0100802800748475,0.7078983783721924,0.5713631330181586,0.6146973967552185,0.65424746,0.0336902179474905,1.0,0.9480272976108846,0.8874571221571561

1. Upward reasoning: This refers to the process of inferring a more general concept or idea from a specific instance or example. In the context of the given text, upward reasoning is shown when the authors move from a specific concept (e.g., ""French dinner"") to a more general concept (e.g., ""dinner"").
2. Downward reasoning: This refers to the process of inferring a more specific concept or idea from a more general one. In the context of the given text, downward reasoning is shown when the authors move from a general concept (e.g., ""dinner"") to a more specific concept (e.g., ""French dinner"").

The authors also mention that the direction of reasoning can be monotonic or non-monotonic, depending on the context. Monotonic reasoning is when the direction of reasoning is consistent, meaning that the more general concept is always inferred from the specific instance, while non-monotonic reasoning is when the direction of reasoning is not consistent, meaning that the specific instance can be inferred from the more general concept or vice versa.

In the given text, the authors provide examples of both upward and downward reasoning, as well as monotonic and non-monotonic reasoning. For example, the sentence ""Workers joined dinner"" is an example of downward reasoning, as the specific concept of ""workers"" is inferred from the more general concept of ""dinner"". The sentence ""French dinner replaced general concept dinner"" is an example of upward reasoning, as the more general concept of ""dinner"" is inferred from the specific instance of ""French dinner""",0.1224489775989171,0.0473372763922832,0.1224489775989171,1.4000105326695302e-05,7.259257177500719,6.246025508794256,0.1775132665094339,0.0101658640984483,0.6176336407661438,0.0,0.510000467300415,0.48471934,0.001937123696358,0.8,0.9440497164330542,0.8980359694526637

1. Morpheme segmentation: The method uses morpheme segmentation to identify the individual morphemes within a word, rather than just segmenting by word boundaries. This allows the method to capture the internal structure of words and their morphological relationships.
2. Morphologically motivated segmentation strategy: The method combines morpheme segmentation with a morphologically motivated segmentation strategy, which takes into account the morphological properties of words and their relationships. This approach aims to improve the translation performance of NMT by preserving the morphological information of the source language.
3. Use of BPE: The method uses BPE to represent words as a sequence of subwords, which helps to reduce the data sparseness problem and improve the generalization of the model to inflectional variants. By using BPE, the method can learn the stem units of words and their morphological relationships, rather than just relying on word-level segmentation.
4. Training on stem units: The method trains the BPE model on stem units rather than individual words, which allows the model to learn the morphological structure of words and their relationships. This approach can help to improve the performance of the model on rare and unknown words.

Overall, the method implements morphology knowledge by combining morpheme segmentation, a morphologically motivated segmentation strategy, and the use of BPE to represent words as a sequence of subwords.

1. Errors in the inflection of the source language words.
2. Errors in the transfer of the inflectional information to the target language.
3. Errors in the generation of the inflected forms in the target language.

The validation set is used to compare the performance of the different models and to show the accuracy of the models in the results table (tabref).

Here are some reasons why:

1. Domain-specific fine-tuning: By fine-tuning the pre-trained language model on a specific domain dataset (e.g., WOZ), the model can learn to recognize and respond to domain-specific concepts and tasks, which may not be present in the multi-domain setting.
2. Overfitting to the source domain: When using a pre-trained language model fine-tuned on a single domain, there is a risk of overfitting to the source domain, which may result in poor generalization to other domains. In the multi-domain setting, the model may not be able to adapt to the diverse range of domains and tasks.
3. Lack of domain-invariant features: If the pre-trained language model is fine-tuned on a single domain, it may not learn domain-invariant features that are relevant across multiple domains. As a result, the model may not be able to generalize well to new domains.
4. Inference time complexity: As the number of domains increases, the inference time complexity may also increase, which may not be desirable for real-time dialogue systems.

However, there are some potential benefits to using a pre-trained language model fine-tuned on a multi-domain dataset, such as:

1. Improved generalization to new domains: By training the model on a diverse range of domains, the model may learn domain-invariant features that are relevant across multiple domains, which can improve its ability to generalize to new domains.
2. Reduced overfitting: By training the model on multiple domains, the risk of overfitting to a single domain may be reduced, which can improve the model's performance on unseen data.
3. Improved scalability: Training a single model on multiple domains can be more scalable than training separate models for each domain, especially if the domains are small or have limited data.

1. Morphological differences: English is a morphologically simple language, with a relatively small number of inflectional endings that indicate grammatical gender. Other languages, such as Spanish, French, and German, have more complex systems of inflectional endings that indicate grammatical gender, and these endings may not be easily transferable to other languages.
2. Word order differences: English has a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, while many other languages have different word orders, such as verb-subject-object (VSO) or subject-object-verb (SOV). This can affect the way that gendered nouns are marked in sentences.
3. Gender agreement differences: In English, gender agreement is relatively simple, with only two gender categories (masculine and feminine) and a small number of gender-neutral nouns. Other languages may have more complex gender systems, with multiple gender categories and more nuanced gender agreement rules.
4. Lack of gendered pronouns: Many languages do not have gendered pronouns, or have a more limited set of gendered pronouns than English. This can make it more difficult to detect and mitigate gender stereotypes in these languages.
5. Cultural and societal differences: Gender stereotypes and societal norms can vary significantly across cultures and languages. What is considered appropriate or acceptable in one culture or language may not be in another.
6. Limited data: The approach from English may be based on a limited dataset of English sentences, which may not be representative of other languages or cultures.
7. Lack of context: The approach from English may not take into account the context in which the words are used, which can be important for understanding the gender of nouns in other languages.
8. Different grammatical features: Other languages may have different grammatical features, such as gendered adjectives, gendered adverbs, or gendered verb forms, which can affect the way that gendered nouns are marked in sentences.

Therefore, it is important to adapt the approach from English to the specific characteristics of other languages, and to consider the cultural and societal contexts in which the words are used",0.0240963848454057,0.0,0.0240963848454057,3.4431470561060115e-21,2.0753628960847434,1.635051646057152,0.0519750519750519,0.0099586512142565,0.6458337306976318,0.2849433124065399,0.3351354002952575,0.51900667,0.0009107517018537,1.0,0.9676081034942132,0.8374495581342585
451,How do they measure grammaticality?,['approach specifically intended yield sentences grammatical additionally consider following log ratio i.e . grammatical phrase ungrammatical phrase displayform'],['calculating log ratio grammatical phrase ungrammatical phrase'],"There are several approaches to measuring grammaticality, and different researchers may use different methods depending on their specific goals and the context of their study. Here are some common methods used to measure grammaticality:

1. Acceptability judgments: In this approach, native speakers of the language are asked to rate the acceptability of a set of sentences, either on a scale (e.g., 1-5) or by categorizing them as either ""grammatical"" or ""ungrammatical."" This method can provide a subjective measure of grammaticality, as the judgments are based on the intuitions of the raters.
2. Self-paced reading: In this method, participants are asked to read a series of sentences aloud, and their reading time is measured as an indicator of grammaticality. The assumption is that participants will take longer to read ungrammatical sentences, as they require more cognitive processing.
3. Eye-tracking: This method involves tracking the eye movements of participants as they read a series of sentences. The amount of time spent looking at a particular sentence can be used as an indicator of grammaticality, as participants are more likely to spend longer looking at grammatical sentences.
4. ERP (Event-Related Potential) measures: This method involves measuring the electrical activity of the brain in response to a sentence. The ERP signal can be used to identify the neural processes involved in language processing, and can provide an objective measure of grammaticality.
5. Behavioral measures: In this approach, participants are asked to perform a task that requires them to process a series of sentences. The accuracy or speed of their performance can be used as an indicator of grammaticality. For example, in a sentence completion task, participants may be faster or more accurate at completing grammatical sentences than ungrammatical ones.
6. Computational modeling: This approach involves using computational models of language processing to predict the grammaticality of a sentence.

Context 2: 'float selected table. comparison wikipedia titles reference'

* System 1 (Traditional NERS): Recall = 0.8

To calculate the difference in recall score between the systems, we can subtract the recall score of System 1 from the recall score of System 2 for each context:

Context 1:

* Difference = 0.9 - 0.8 = 0.1

Context 2:

* Difference = 0.95 - 0.8 = 0.15

Therefore, the difference in recall score between the two systems is 0.1 for Context 1 and 0.15 for Context 2.

The features identified by the HMM models can be interpreted by analyzing the hidden states of the LSTM components. The hidden states of the LSTM components can be visualized using figures, such as those shown in the provided examples, which can help to identify similar features and patterns in the data.

2. Independent annotation: Each worker annotates the data independently, which helps to reduce the impact of bias and increase the accuracy of the annotations.
3. Predicate-based annotation: The workers are trained to annotate the data using predicates, which are specific rules or criteria for labeling the data. This helps to ensure that the annotations are consistent and reliable.
4. Consolidation task: After the initial annotation, a consolidation task is performed to validate the questions, merge or split answers, and modify them according to guidelines. This helps to ensure that the final set of annotations is accurate and consistent.
5. Role-based annotation: The workers are assigned specific roles based on their expertise and skills, such as ""people"" or ""councillor,"" which helps to ensure that the annotations are accurate and relevant.
6. Better coverage: The improved annotation protocol yields better coverage, as the annotations are reviewed and validated by multiple workers, and any redundant or irrelevant annotations are removed.

Overall, the improved annotation protocol is more comprehensive, accurate, and efficient than the previous protocol, and it allows for a larger and more diverse pool of annotators to contribute to the annotation process",0.0149253724159055,0.0,0.0149253724159055,8.748678548578128e-17,2.700200473941302,2.08144538872836,0.0568181818181818,0.0099009900990099,0.6873646378517151,0.0,0.7394093871116638,0.51677275,0.0148671671521138,,0.9786149278277956,0.8486806302757008

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how word lattices can be obtained from words:

1. Tokenization: First, the input sentence is tokenized into individual words or characters.
2. Node creation: Each word is represented as a node in the graph.
3. Edge creation: Possible substring connections between words are identified, and directed edges are created between the corresponding nodes. For example, if the sentence is ""The cat chased the mouse"", the nodes for ""cat"", ""chased"", and ""mouse"" would be connected by directed edges to represent the possible substring connections.
4. Edge labeling: Each edge is labeled with the type of connection it represents, such as a neighbor word connection or a substring connection.
5. Directed graph construction: The node and edge set is constructed into a directed graph, where each node represents a word and each directed edge represents a possible substring or neighbor word connection.
6. Inlineform representation: The word lattice can be represented in inlineform, where each node is represented as a word and each directed edge is represented as a possible substring or neighbor word connection.
7. Figref representation: The word lattice can also be represented in figref, where each node is represented as a reference to a figure and each directed edge is represented as a connection between figures.

By representing words as nodes in a directed graph, word lattices can capture the structural relationships between words in a sentence, such as neighbor word connections and possible substring connections. This can be useful for various NLP tasks, such as language modeling, text classification, and machine translation",0.0451127806930861,0.0088495567573812,0.0451127806930861,3.3778911969191256e-12,3.469815364798496,2.8254036517626515,0.0635593220338983,0.009965906110674,0.5916454195976257,0.3318705321546711,0.4977715015411377,0.8673234,0.0014978092255601,1.0,0.9776800179505756,0.8186037652496273

1. Transfer learning: The model is pre-trained on a large dataset of labeled tweets related to blizzards, hurricanes, and wildfires, and fine-tuned on a smaller dataset of labeled tweets related to climate change. This allows the model to leverage the knowledge learned from the large dataset to improve its performance on the smaller dataset.
2. Semi-supervised learning: The model is trained on both labeled and unlabeled data. The labeled data is used to guide the training process, while the unlabeled data is used to regularize the model and prevent overfitting.
3. Ensemble learning: The model combines the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data, using techniques such as bagging or boosting, to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the model.
4. Active learning: The model selects the most informative tweets to be labeled by a human annotator, based on the model's confidence in its predictions, to maximize the amount of information gained from the labeling process.

These baseline models are typically based on simple, straightforward approaches that are easy to implement and interpret. Here are some of the most commonly used baseline models for table evaluation:

1. Frequency-based baselines: These models use frequency-based features such as word frequency, document frequency, and co-occurrence to evaluate the importance of table cells.
2. TF-IDF baselines: These models use the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm to calculate the importance of table cells. TF-IDF is a widely used technique in information retrieval and text classification.
3. Naive Bayes baselines: These models use a naive Bayes classifier to evaluate the importance of table cells based on their features. Naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic classifier that is easy to implement and interpret.
4. Logistic Regression baselines: These models use logistic regression to evaluate the importance of table cells based on their features. Logistic regression is a widely used linear model that is well-suited for classification tasks.
5. Random Forest baselines: These models use a random forest classifier to evaluate the importance of table cells based on their features. Random forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.
6. Gradient Boosting baselines: These models use a gradient boosting classifier to evaluate the importance of table cells based on their features. Gradient boosting is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak models to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.

These baseline models are often used as a starting point for more advanced models, such as deep learning models, to compare their performance and evaluate their improvements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how they might have collected the comparable corpus:

1. Data Collection: The authors used the Gardenhose API to collect a large dataset of Twitter posts. This API allows researchers to collect tweets in real-time, providing a uniform sample of tweets that are representative of the overall Twitter population.
2. Language Constraints: To ensure that the collected tweets were in English, the authors applied a second constraint that required individual tweets to match English stopwords. They used the NLTK database to determine the stopwords for each language, and they only included tweets that contained English stopwords.
3. Tweet Selection: The authors selected tweets that contained causal statements, such as ""caused causing causes."" They also included tweets that contained bidirectional words, such as ""associate"" and ""connect,"" which can be used to relate two objects.
4. Document Preparation: The authors prepared the tweets for analysis by converting them into documents. Each document contained a single causeword, which was chosen from a list of synonyms for ""cause."" The authors also included control documents that contained caused causing causes, but did not include any causewords.
5. Temporal Matching: To ensure that the causal and control documents were matched temporally, the authors selected control documents that were posted within a 15-minute period of the causal documents.
6. Synonym Replacement: To further control for causality, the authors replaced causewords in the control documents with synonyms for ""cause."" This allowed them to test whether the causal relationships they identified were specific to the causewords or were more general.
7. Final Procedure: The authors identified causal control documents by comparing the causal documents to the control documents. They found that three causewords (caused, causes, and causing) appeared in the causal documents, but not in the control documents.

They also considered additional synonyms for cause words, although they did not pursue this line of work in this study.

Here's a breakdown of the steps they took to collect the control corpus:

1. They selected documents that contained one occurrence of an exact unigrams (i.e., a single word) that was the cause of the effect.
2. They included words that were popular contractions, such as ""gonna"" instead of ""going to.""
3. They restricted the analysis to single relationships between two objects, and they only considered documents that contained bidirectional words that associate, relate, connect, or correlate with the cause words.
4. They selected documents that were temporally matched with the causal documents, i.e., they were written within a 15-minute period of the causal documents.
5. They otherwise selected control documents randomly, but they made sure that the control documents did not contain any causal synonyms that may present in the causal documents.
6. They identified the causal control documents by selecting documents that contained the cause words and the caused causing causes.

In summary, the authors collected the control corpus by selecting documents that contained caused causing causes and bidirectional words, and they temporally matched them with the causal documents. They also selected control documents randomly, but they made sure that they did not contain any causal synonyms that may present in the causal documents",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7598252158074892,0.5698689118556169,0.0,0.0099009900990099,0.1959402114152908,0.0,0.592767596244812,Error,0.0232896867730528,0.8333333333333334,0.9446483852076882,0.7309779962885694

The resolution model variables are used to indicate the mode in which a mention is resolved, and they are typically denoted by uppercase letters such as Pi, Π, or π.

In the context of the Stanford CoreNLP system, the resolution model variables are used to represent the three resolution modes that are available in the system:

1. String matching: This mode uses string matching to resolve coreference links between mentions.
2. Precise construct matching: This mode uses precise construct matching to resolve coreference links between mentions.
3. Attributive matching: This mode uses attributive matching to resolve coreference links between mentions.

Each resolution model variable is associated with a specific mention in the text, and it indicates the mode in which the mention is resolved. For example, if a mention is resolved using string matching, the resolution model variable for that mention would be set to ""string matching"".

The resolution model variables are used to determine the type of coreference link that exists between two mentions, and they are used to guide the processing of the text. For example, if two mentions are resolved using the same resolution model variable, it may indicate that they are coreferent and should be linked together",0.0727272710743802,0.0,0.054545452892562,6.39413595928151e-08,3.443460231010827,2.825787809217364,0.0806451612903226,0.0099881198574382,0.2853142321109772,1.0,1.0,0.8291199,0.0883225171353396,0.6666666666666666,0.914451935129146,0.7923153359841473

1. Absolute Length Encoding: This method encodes the remaining length of the target sequence (i.e., the length of the sequence after the current token) in the positional embedding. The authors propose using the absolute position of the token in the sequence (i.e., the token position) to encode the remaining length. Specifically, they use the floor function to quantize the remaining length into a finite set of n integers, and then use one-hot encoding to represent the integer index. This approach is similar to the ""ildots"" method proposed in the paper.
2. Relative Length Encoding: This method encodes the relative position of the token in the sequence, rather than its absolute position. The authors propose using the difference between the token position and the position of the previous token (i.e., the relative position) to encode the relative length. This approach is similar to the ""similarity"" method proposed in the paper.

Both of these length encoding methods can be used to provide the model with information about the length of the target sequence, which can help the model to better understand the context in which the current token is being processed. The authors note that using length information in the positional embedding can help to solve ambiguity in the sequence, particularly when the length of the target sequence is not fixed.

The authors also propose a new representation based on BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) that takes into account the length of the input sequence. This representation is similar to the ""bpe"" method proposed in the paper, but it uses length information to encode the input sequence in a more efficient way. The authors show that this representation can lead to better translations and faster training times compared to the original BPE method",0.0992907784678839,0.0083681998081267,0.0992907784678839,9.647638844876696e-09,4.761883880137434,3.9716497797547983,0.1151776365451579,0.00996382560132,0.4083799123764038,0.961483021305032,0.8702540397644043,0.8206105,0.1785731669907337,1.0,0.8233982500896874,0.8280946885193683

Here's a breakdown of the steps they take:

1. Split the training data into three groups according to the length ratio of the target and source sentences. Specifically, they split the data into:
	* Group 1 (short target, short source)
	* Group 2 (normal target, normal source)
	* Group 3 (long target, long source)
2. Select two thresholds (ttextmin and ttextmax) based on the length ratio distribution of the data. These thresholds will be used to determine which group a sentence pair belongs to.
3. For each sentence pair, calculate the length ratio of the target and source sentences.
4. Based on the length ratio, assign the sentence pair to one of the three groups. If the target sentence is short and the source sentence is short, the pair belongs to Group 1. If the target sentence is normal and the source sentence is normal, the pair belongs to Group 2. If the target sentence is long and the source sentence is long, the pair belongs to Group 3.
5. During training, prepend a length token to the source sentence of each sentence pair, according to the group it belongs to. For example, if a sentence pair belongs to Group 1, the length token for the source sentence will be ""short"". If the pair belongs to Group 2, the length token will be ""normal"", and if it belongs to Group 3, the length token will be ""long"".
6. Train the NMT model on the prepped sentence pairs, with the length token as an additional feature.
7. During inference, use the length token to condition the output of the NMT model. Specifically, the authors use a bias network to generate a length-based output, which is then used to guide the translation process. The bias network takes the source sentence length as input and outputs a vector that represents the desired length of the target sentence. This vector is then used to guide the generation of the target sentence.

By conditioning the output on the length of the source sentence, the authors are able to generate translations that are more consistent with the length of the original source sentence. This can be particularly useful for tasks where the length of the output is",0.1374999981007812,0.0290909079309752,0.1249999981007812,8.841712074176761e-09,5.395883493682389,4.633276955167692,0.1649709302325581,0.0100533442757488,0.5815722346305847,0.0908513111727578,0.2985614538192749,0.37011772,0.007195304282485,1.0,0.89537798469689,0.8436456055229256

It differs from traditional calibration methods like Platt Scaling in several ways:

1. Calibration vs. Confidence Modeling: Platt Scaling is a calibration method that aims to transform the probabilities output by a model into calibrated probabilities that better reflect the true uncertainty of the model. In contrast, the proposed method focuses on improving the confidence modeling of the system, which involves learning a confidence model that can accurately predict the quality of the extracted assertions.
2. Use of Extractions: Platt Scaling does not use extractions or any additional supervision other than the ground truth labels. In contrast, the proposed method uses a combination of external models and confidence modeling to improve the quality of the extracted assertions.
3. Iterative Learning: Platt Scaling is a one-time calibration method that does not involve iterative learning. In contrast, the proposed method involves an iterative learning procedure that refines the confidence model over time based on the performance of the system on the training data.
4. Focus on Binary Classification: Platt Scaling is typically used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict a binary label (e.g., positive or negative). In contrast, the proposed method is designed for open-domain question answering tasks, where the goal is to extract assertions from a given text.
5. Use of AUC-ROC: The proposed method uses the AUC-ROC metric to evaluate the performance of the system, while Platt Scaling typically uses the log loss or other pointwise calibration metrics.

In summary, the proposed method in the paper you provided is an iterative learning procedure that aims to improve the confidence modeling of open-domain question answering systems by using external models and confidence modeling to refine the quality of the extracted assertions.

Specifically, the input representation consists of:

1. Word embeddings: Each word in the tuple is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space using word embeddings.
2. Predicate embeddings: In addition to the word embeddings, the model also uses predicate embeddings to represent the predicates in the tuple. These embeddings are learned during training and are used to capture the relationships between predicates and their arguments.
3. Masking: To prevent the model from considering the predicate as a regular word, a masking layer is applied to the predicate embeddings. This layer sets the values of the predicate embeddings to zero, except for the last dimension, which is set to one.
4. Input concatenation: The word embeddings and predicate embeddings are concatenated along the channel dimension to form the final input representation.

The paper proposes using this concept to measure the effect of minor senses on the primary sense of a polysemous word.

Surrounding uniformity is roughly equivalent to statistical fluctuation, and it is measured by comparing the uniformity of the vector representations of the word and its neighbors. The uniformity of a vector representation is measured using the triangle inequality, which compares the size of the vector to the sum of the sizes of its components.

To compute the surrounding uniformity of a word, the paper suggests using the following formula:

surrounding uniformity = (size of vector) / (sum of sizes of components)

where size of vector is the magnitude of the vector representation of the word, and sum of sizes of components is the sum of the magnitudes of the components of the vector representation.

The paper also suggests using the concept of ""uniformity sets"" to measure the relationship between the surrounding uniformity and polysemy. A uniformity set is a set of vectors that have similar uniformity values. The paper proposes using these sets to compute the surrounding uniformity of a word and its neighbors, and to discuss the relationship between surrounding uniformity and polysemy",0.1111111066666668,0.0094786691772437,0.1111111066666668,0.1424324056005313,16.39340611724343,13.273319560493782,0.1787505858574023,0.0101770528370277,0.5969194173812866,0.7938410531451955,0.4453650116920471,0.42075065,0.0075596302792889,0.1666666666666666,0.8497691276513842,0.8649420608869908

These annotations are typically used in more controlled settings, such as dialog systems or virtual assistants, where the goal is to generate responses that are contextually appropriate and coherent.

For news summarization, the focus is usually on extracting the most important information from a document or article, rather than generating responses that are contextually appropriate. As a result, the annotations used in news summarization datasets are typically limited to basic information such as named entities, keywords, and sentence boundaries.

However, if you are working on a specific task that requires more fine-grained annotations, such as dialog systems or virtual assistants, then it may be necessary to include speaker role, semantic slot, and dialog domain annotations in your dataset. In these cases, it is important to carefully consider the specific requirements of your task and the types of annotations that will be most useful for training and evaluating your model.

In general, it is important to carefully evaluate the needs of your task and the available annotations when selecting a dataset for training and evaluating your model.

CIC is defined as the recall of semantic slot values in the reference summary, where the semantic slots are predefined based on the essential entities in the dialog domain.

In other words, CIC evaluates how well the summary retains the critical information within the dialog domain, such as proper nouns and essential entities, which are important for the task of summarization. This is in contrast to ROUGE, which treats all words equally and does not consider the informativeness of common words or phrases.

CIC is computed by comparing the candidate summary with the reference summary and measuring the recall of the semantic slot values. The semantic slots are defined based on the predefined essential entities in the dialog domain, such as restaurant names, time, and other critical information.

Experiments have shown that CIC is a suitable complementary metric to ROUGE, as it provides a more comprehensive evaluation of summarization quality by considering critical informative entities. The arithmetic mean of CIC and ROUGE is used to retain overall performance, and the results show that CIC can help identify summaries that are more informative and retain more critical information",0.1428571405228017,0.0306122433137235,0.11111110877677,0.0004275153984091,8.955879430445123,7.637689235806095,0.2097715318869165,0.0100894726822767,0.4850139021873474,0.4954906685396711,0.6812761425971985,0.690972,0.0400855572568596,0.8,0.8676911497501455,0.8619128971852241

1. Ambiguous sentences: Some sentences may be labelled incorrectly, appearing far away from the population class centroid.
2. Sentence examples: The ambiguous cases may not be clearly represented in the training data, making it difficult for the model to learn.
3. Multiple tags per sentence: The model may need to use multiple tags per sentence to accurately reflect the intervention content, which can be challenging.
4. Hidden state output: The hidden state output of the model may not accurately represent the true labels of the sentences, leading to errors in prediction.
5. Visualization: Visualization techniques, such as T-SNE, may not effectively capture the underlying structure of the data, making it difficult to interpret the results.
6. Label position: The position of the labels in the input data may not accurately reflect the true labels of the sentences, leading to errors in prediction.
7. Neither label position: The model may not be able to accurately predict the labels of sentences that are not clearly represented in the training data, leading to errors in prediction.
8. Supports need multiple tags: The model may need to use multiple tags to accurately predict the labels of sentences that are not clearly represented in the training data.

To address these problems, the author suggests using a pre-trained language model like BERT, fine-tuning the weights within the network, and using a visualization technique like T-SNE to better understand the underlying structure of the data",0.0444444434611797,0.0104712035799457,0.0444444434611797,2.0842927556357842e-13,3.1180930604204,2.550709151859244,0.097911227154047,0.0099009900990099,0.4702508449554443,0.0963834969279093,0.1962220519781112,0.6011106,0.0380941802442789,1.0,0.9979926950257626,0.8302905254181454

1. Input Encoder: This module is responsible for encoding the input document, which is a sequence of words or sentences, into a fixed-length vector representation. The input encoder uses a technique called word embeddings to map each word in the document to a point in a high-dimensional space. The word embeddings are learned during training and capture the meaning and context of each word in the document.
2. Dynamic Memory: This module is a key component of the model that stores the input document in a dynamic memory. The dynamic memory is a data structure that can store information for a short period of time, allowing the model to remember the input document while processing it. The dynamic memory is implemented using a recurrent neural network (RNN) that takes the input document and generates a sequence of hidden states. Each hidden state captures the information from the previous hidden state and the current input word.
3. Output Module: This module is responsible for generating the output answer to a question. The output module takes the hidden states from the dynamic memory and uses them to compute the output answer. The output module is implemented using another RNN that takes the hidden states and generates a sequence of output words.

The novelty of the model lies in the use of dynamic memory, which allows the model to remember the input document while processing it. This is different from traditional neural network-based models that only consider the current input word when generating the output answer. The dynamic memory allows the model to capture long-term dependencies in the input document and generate more accurate answers to questions.

The operations executed by the network in a single example would be as follows:

1. The input document, consisting of a sequence of sentences, is passed through the input encoder, which generates a set of word embeddings for each sentence.
2. The word embeddings are stored in the dynamic memory, which is implemented using an RNN.
3. The RNN takes the word embeddings and generates a sequence of hidden states.
4. The hidden states are passed through the output module, which generates a sequence of output words that answer the question.

""The cat sat on the mat.""
""The dog chased the cat.""

1. Perplexity: Perplexity measures the probability of the model generating a particular target sequence. Lower perplexity values indicate that the model is more likely to generate the target sequence, which can be an indicator of a lack of diversity in the inferences.
2. BLEU score: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a measure of the accuracy of the generated text. It compares the generated text to a reference text and assigns a score based on the similarity between the two. A higher BLEU score indicates that the generated text is more similar to the reference text, which can be an indicator of a lack of diversity in the inferences.

They also use two other measures to evaluate the performance of the model:

1. Distinct n-grams: This measure evaluates the number of distinct n-grams (sequences of n items) in the generated text. A higher number of distinct n-grams indicates a more diverse set of inferences.
2. Normalized dividing total number of generated tokens: This measure evaluates the proportion of unique tokens in the generated text.

From the first context, we can see that the authors are comparing the perplexity of their CWVAE model with baseline methods, and they report that their model achieves a significant improvement in perplexity compared to the baseline methods. Specifically, they report that their model achieves an average perplexity of 12.3, while the best baseline method achieves an average perplexity of 14.1.

1. Pre-training: In this stage, the CWVAE is trained on a large, unlabelled dataset of narrative stories that contain rich event background knowledge. The context-aware latent variable in the CWVAE is used to learn the event background information from the stories. The latent variable captures the contextual information and the relationships between the events in the stories.
2. Fine-tuning: In this stage, the pre-trained CWVAE is fine-tuned on a task-specific dataset that contains specific aspects of the event background information, such as intents or reactions. The fine-tuning process adapts the event background information learned during pre-training to the specific task at hand.

In more detail, the CWVAE learns event background information by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) during pre-training. The ELBO is a lower bound on the log-likelihood of the data, and it is used as a proxy objective to train the model. The ELBO consists of two terms: the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence term.

During pre-training, the CWVAE is trained to minimize the reconstruction loss, which encourages the model to learn a compact and informative representation of the input data. The KL divergence term encourages the model to learn a probabilistic representation of the input data, which allows the model to capture the uncertainty and contextual information in the data.

During fine-tuning, the pre-trained CWVAE is trained on a task-specific dataset to adapt the event background information to the specific task. The model is trained to minimize the task-specific loss function, such as the cross-entropy loss for intent classification or the hinge loss for sentiment analysis. The fine-tuning process updates the model's parameters to adapt the event background information to the specific task, while preserving the contextual information learned during pre-training.

Overall, the context-aware variational autoencoder learns event background information by combining the context-aware latent variable with the pre-training and fine-",0.1315789448000346,0.0238095220222349,0.1315789448000346,0.0003253264311529,8.981300115709088,7.667643115511484,0.2450185063124271,0.0103092783505154,0.6573559045791626,0.6429331331617302,0.7159085869789124,0.5954297,0.0058892991258162,,0.9838256299118084,0.8839265947735356

The process involved the following steps:

1. Collecting tweets: A large corpus of tweets related to DDEO was collected.
2. Preprocessing: The collected tweets were preprocessed using two preprocessing steps:

a. Standard list removal: Stop words and punctuation were removed from the tweets.

b. Semantic value analysis: The tweets were analyzed to find the semantic value of each word.
3. Finding the optimum number of topics: The optimum number of topics was determined using log-likelihood estimation. The log-likelihood was calculated for different numbers of topics, and the highest log-likelihood was used to determine the optimum number of topics.
4. Topic modeling: LDA was used to perform topic modeling on the preprocessed tweets. LDA assumes that each document (tweet) contains a mixture of topics, and each topic is characterized by a distribution of words. The topics were identified by assigning each word in the corpus to a topic, and the topics were represented by a distribution of words.
5. Identifying relevant clinical concepts: The identified topics were then analyzed to identify relevant clinical concepts related to DDEO. This was done by examining the words and phrases that were most closely associated with each topic.

It seems that the authors are using a stochastic approach to train the embeddings, as they mention repeating the training process multiple times and reporting the respective mean and standard deviation statistics. They also mention checking the coefficients of the model and selecting the one with the highest likelihood on the development set to evaluate the out-of-sample generalization performance.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors are using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or a similar optimization algorithm to train the embeddings, and they are using the train set to optimize the parameters of the embedding model.

The data includes variables such as trip purpose, education level, family type, and other categorical variables that are typically dummy-encoded due to their categorical nature. The paper may also consider variables such as age, income, and origin-destination pair.

To model travel behavior using this data, the authors may employ various techniques, such as:

1. Multinomial logistic regression: This method can be used to model the probability of choosing one destination over another, given the categorical variables such as trip purpose, education level, family type, and other factors.
2. Clustering analysis: This technique can group travelers based on their similarities and differences in travel behavior, which can help identify patterns and trends in travel behavior.
3. Decision trees and random forests: These methods can be used to identify the most important factors influencing travel behavior and to predict the likelihood of travelers choosing a particular destination.
4. Neural networks: This technique can be used to model complex relationships between the categorical variables and travel behavior, and to predict the likelihood of travelers choosing a particular destination.
5. Markov chain models: These models can be used to capture the transitions between different destinations and to predict the probability of travelers moving from one destination to another.

1. Lack of intersentential context: The evaluation was conducted at the sentence level, which may not accurately reflect the quality of the machine translations when considering the context across sentence boundaries.
2. Random ordering of sentences: The sentences were evaluated in a random order, which may have precluded raters from detecting translation errors that become apparent only when considering the intersentential context.
3. Use of bilingual crowd workers: The use of bilingual crowd workers may not have been representative of the target audience for the machine translations, and may have biased the results towards more accurate translations for the specific language pair being evaluated.
4. Comparison to professional translators: The study compared the machine translations to professional translations, which may not be the most appropriate comparison for evaluating the quality of machine translations.
5. Use of human reference translations: The study used human reference translations that were not necessarily of high quality, which may have influenced the results and made it more difficult to assess the quality of the machine translations.
6. Lack of consideration of context: The study did not consider the context in which the machine translations were being used, which may be an important factor in evaluating their quality.
7. Limited scope: The study evaluated the machine translations only at the sentence level, which may not be sufficient to assess their quality for real-world applications.

In this case, the paper considers several product categories such as cell phones, accessories, clothing, shoes, home, kitchen, and tools for home improvement.

The content clusters are derived from unsupervised content-driven clustering of the text data, and they capture the underlying themes and patterns in the data. By incorporating these content clusters into the supervised classification model, the model can learn to use the cluster assignments to improve its predictions of incident severity.

One way to use content clusters to improve the prediction of incident severity is to treat the cluster assignments as additional features in the classification model. For example, the model can be trained to predict not only the external category and location of the incident, but also the content cluster assignment. This allows the model to leverage the information captured by the content clusters to improve its predictions of incident severity.

Another way to use content clusters is to use them as a preprocessing step before applying supervised classification. By clustering the text data and then applying one-hot encoding to the cluster assignments, the model can learn to use the cluster assignments as additional features to improve its predictions of incident severity.

Overall, using content clusters to improve the prediction of incident severity can help to capture the underlying themes and patterns in the text data, and can provide a more accurate and robust prediction of incident severity",0.0808080796694215,0.0258064509885536,0.0808080796694215,1.2898862469381202e-12,4.151916242988399,3.488299261332264,0.1351515151515152,0.009943242435881,0.4212512075901031,0.5615573631543103,0.7745252847671509,0.5728104,0.0179429007903239,1.0,0.9947592528283394,0.8017425116710073

In the context of gender bias in word embeddings, counterfactual data augmentation can be used to mitigate the bias by swapping gendered words in the training data with their counterfactual counterparts.

For example, if a word embedding model has learned that ""grandmother"" is associated with femininity, the model may have difficulty generalizing to instances where ""grandmother"" is used to refer to a man. By swapping ""grandmother"" with ""grandfather"" in the training data, the model is forced to learn that ""grandfather"" can also be associated with femininity, and vice versa. This can help the model to become more robust and generalizable to unseen data.

The use of counterfactual data augmentation in word embedding can help to mitigate gender bias in several ways:

1. Reduces gender stereotyping: By swapping gendered words with their counterfactual counterparts, the model is forced to learn that gender is not a determinant of a word's meaning. This can help to reduce gender stereotyping in the model's embeddings.
2. Increases generalizability: By exposing the model to a wider range of gendered words, the model becomes more robust and generalizable to unseen data.
3. Improves fairness: By mitigating gender bias in the word embeddings, the model becomes more fair and inclusive, and is less likely to perpetuate gender stereotypes.

Overall, counterfactual data augmentation is a powerful technique for mitigating gender bias in word embeddings, and can help to improve the fairness and generalizability of NLP models",0.0650406491902968,0.019323670844127,0.0650406491902968,3.863117700627791e-12,4.259846996198424,3.5096970670754923,0.1058036945133719,0.0099758162031438,0.549138605594635,0.4453507955358537,0.2431220412254333,0.76388,0.011505670530031,1.0,0.9438126704433696,0.856014735992422

They introduce a new method called docvecc, which is a data-dependent regularization method that clamps the representation of words that frequently appear in the training set and have low informativeness.

To determine the informativeness of words, the authors use a cutoff experiment, where they select a subset of words that are least frequent in the training set and compute the norm of their embeddings. They then compare the norm of the embeddings for these words to a threshold value, and any words with norms below the threshold are considered uninformative.

The authors use a table (tabref) to list the words that are found to have the smallest norm embeddings, and they note that despite their low frequency, these words are often indicative of sentiment in the text.

567,How have the differences in communication styles between Twitter and Facebook increase the complexity of the problem?,['abovediscussed systems either shows high performance twitter dataset b facebook dataset given trac english codemixed datasets . may due text style level complexities datasets . concentrated develop robust system english codemixed texts unilingual texts also handle different writing styles . approach based three main ideas'],['systems perform well facebook twitter texts'],"The differences in communication styles between Twitter and Facebook have increased the complexity of the problem in several ways:

1. Vocabulary and syntax: Each platform has its own unique vocabulary and syntax, which can lead to differences in the way words and phrases are used and understood. For example, Twitter's character limit and hashtag usage can result in a more concise and informal tone, while Facebook's longer posts and use of emojis can lead to a more conversational and expressive tone.
2. Tone and style: The tone and style of communication on Twitter and Facebook can also differ. Twitter is often used for breaking news and quick updates, so the tone can be more urgent and serious. Facebook, on the other hand, is often used for more personal and casual communication, so the tone can be more relaxed and humorous.
3. Multimodality: Twitter and Facebook both allow for text-based communication, but they also offer additional features such as images, videos, and emojis. This multimodality can add an extra layer of complexity to the problem, as the system must be able to handle and interpret different types of media.
4. Code-switching: Twitter and Facebook users may also engage in code-switching, which is the practice of switching between different languages or language varieties in the same conversation. This can make the task of developing a robust system for English code-mixed texts more challenging, as the system must be able to handle and interpret different languages and language varieties.
5. Different writing styles: Twitter and Facebook have different writing styles, which can be due to the platform's specific features, user demographics, and usage patterns. For example, Twitter is known for its use of hashtags and short sentences, while Facebook is known for its longer posts and more conversational tone. These differences in writing styles can make it more challenging to develop a system that can handle and interpret text data from both platforms.

In summary, the differences in communication styles between Twitter and Facebook have increased the complexity of the problem by introducing variations in vocabulary, tone, style, multimodality, code-switching, and writing styles. To develop a robust system for English code-mixed texts, it is essential to consider these differences and design a system that can handle",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.278247392594212,0.9586855444456588,0.0296442687747035,0.0099538334267339,0.605902910232544,0.86679298970554,0.8601689338684082,0.43892077,0.1424166883210519,1.0,0.9514226282833486,0.8348577097973117

Instead, they mention that the presence of code-mixed content in social media text increases the complexity of aggression detection tasks, and provide examples of code-mixed datasets, such as the one provided by the organizers of the task (Trac and BibRef).

The authors note that code-mixing, which refers to the use of linguistic units from different languages in a single utterance or sentence, and codeswitching, which refers to the co-occurrence of speech extracts belonging to two different grammatical systems, are common phenomena in informal settings such as social media. They suggest that the interchange of languages in these settings can make grammar complex and difficult to handle using traditional algorithms, which may lead to increased complexity in aggression detection tasks.

However, the authors do not provide any empirical evidence to support the assertion that the majority of aggressive conversations contain code-mixed languages. They simply highlight the potential challenges that code-mixing and codeswitching can pose for aggression detection tasks, and suggest that these challenges may be addressed through the use of machine learning algorithms that can handle complex linguistic structures",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413386797892458,0.1060040098419343,0.0,0.0099009900990099,0.0804304480552673,0.0,0.2668863832950592,Error,0.0039665972477885,1.0,0.0,0.6947516077806715

2. BilSTM augmented attention mechanism: The current approach uses a BilSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) augmented attention mechanism, which is a more advanced and sophisticated technique than what may have been used in previous applications. BilSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly well-suited for processing sequential data, such as text. The augmented attention mechanism allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input data that are relevant to the task at hand.
3. Consideration of related images: The current approach considers related images as part of the task, whereas previous applications may have only focused on individual images. This could involve comparing images, identifying similarities and differences, or performing other forms of image analysis.

The text mentions that maximum likelihood learning fits the model pθ using the data distribution, whereas decoded sequences are trained using the model qmathcal{f} induced by the decoding algorithm. This suggests that the decoding algorithm, rather than the maximum likelihood learning, is responsible for generating infinite-length sequences.

The text also mentions that inconsistency may arise from lack of decoding, which suggests that the decoding algorithm may not be able to generate all possible sequences that are consistent with the model. This could lead to inconsistent or incomplete decoding, which may result in infinite-length sequences.

However, the text does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether infinite-length sequence generation is a result of training with maximum likelihood. It does suggest that sequence-level learning, which uses decoding algorithms to train the model, may be a better approach to generating consistent sequences.

The subjects are given a subset of Wikidata bibrefs, which are chosen to cover high and low levels of similarity, and they are asked to rate the similarity of each pair on an integer scale from 1 to 5. The authors use the leave-one-out method to estimate the inter-subject correlation, which is a measure of how consistently the subjects agree on the similarity judgments.

To be more specific, the authors follow these steps to gather human judgments for similarity between relations:

1. Select a subset of Wikidata bibrefs: The authors choose a subset of bibrefs from Wikidata, which is a large knowledge graph that contains information about entities, properties, and relations.
2. Choose high and low similarity pairs: The authors select a subset of bibrefs that cover both high and low levels of similarity. For example, they might select pairs of bibrefs that have a high degree of similarity in terms of their semantic meaning, as well as pairs that have a low degree of similarity.
3. Ask subjects to rate similarity: The authors ask nine undergraduate subjects to rate the similarity of each pair of bibrefs on an integer scale from 1 to 5. The subjects are given a set of instructions that explain how to assess the similarity between the pairs.
4. Use leave-one-out method to estimate inter-subject correlation: To estimate the inter-subject correlation, the authors use the leave-one-out method, which involves leaving one subject's judgments out of the analysis and using the remaining eight subjects' judgments to estimate the correlation.
5. Calculate inter-subject correlation: The authors calculate the inter-subject correlation using the leave-one-out method. They can also calculate the average similarity score and the standard deviation of the similarity scores to assess the consistency of the subjects' judgments.
6. Use reference values to assess performance: The authors use the reference values of the similarity judgments to assess the performance of the machine learning models. They can compare the predicted similarity scores with the reference values to evaluate how well the models are performing.

1. Restricted vocabulary size: The task requires the model to generate text using a limited set of words, which can be challenging as it restricts the range of possible expressions and may not allow for the most accurate or natural-sounding output.
2. Special case: The task is a special case of language modelling, which may require the model to generate text that is tailored to a specific context or task, such as addressing a particular audience or achieving a specific goal. This can be more challenging than general language modelling tasks.
3. Expected perfect accuracy: The baseline performance for this task is expected to be perfect accuracy, as the model is being trained to generate text that is both accurate and natural-sounding. This can be a high bar to meet, especially for a model with a limited vocabulary size.
4. Uncertainty and surprise: The task may involve unexpected elements or surprises, which can make it more difficult for the model to generate accurate and coherent text.

These points are chosen such that they correspond to the means of the distribution of the data in the domain. The researchers then generate a set of covariance matrices for each point in the set, which are used to define the variance of the data in the domain.

To generate the synthetic dataset, the researchers use an iterative process that involves the following steps:

1. Choose a set of k points in the domain of interest, where k is a user-defined parameter.
2. For each point in the set, generate a set of covariance matrices that define the variance of the data in the domain.
3. Use the covariance matrices to generate a set of data points that follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution with centroids at the points chosen in step 1.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until a desired number of samples have been generated.

They also mention the importance of sufficient diversity in the training data and the existence of fairly large datasets for training.

Given these requirements, a suitable model architecture for sentence encoding could be a multitask learning setup that jointly trains the model on multiple tasks, such as:

1. Sentence similarity: This task involves training the model to predict the similarity or dissimilarity between two sentences.
2. Sentence classification: This task involves training the model to classify sentences into predefined categories, such as positive/negative sentiment or topic categories.
3. Named entity recognition: This task involves training the model to identify and classify named entities in sentences, such as people, organizations, and locations.
4. Part-of-speech tagging: This task involves training the model to assign part-of-speech tags to words in sentences, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.

By jointly training the model on these tasks, the model can learn to encode sentences in a way that is useful for a wide range of downstream tasks, and can also learn to generalize well to new tasks.

Some possible model architectures for sentence encoding could include:

1. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs): RNNs are a type of neural network that are well-suited to sequential data, such as sentences. They can be trained to learn the dependencies between words in a sentence and to encode sentences in a way that captures this information.
2. Transformers: Transformers are a type of neural network that are specifically designed for natural language processing tasks. They use self-attention mechanisms to allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence, and have been shown to be effective for a wide range of NLP tasks.
3. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs): CNNs are a type of neural network that are well-suited to processing sequential data, and have been used for a variety of NLP tasks, such as text classification and sentiment analysis.

The cosine similarity measures the degree of association between two vectors, with a positive value indicating a stronger association and a negative value indicating a weaker association.

In the context of question answering, the vector representations of the question and the possible answers can be calculated using techniques such as word embeddings or sentence embeddings. For example, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) or the BibRef SentenceBERT can be used to generate vector representations of sentences. These vector representations can then be compared to determine the degree of association between the question and each possible answer.

To measure the moral bias of an answer, the cosine similarity between the vector representation of the question and the vector representation of the answer can be calculated. A higher cosine similarity indicates a stronger association between the question and the answer, and therefore a stronger moral bias.

Additionally, the vector representations of two opposite answers can be compared to determine the bias value. If the cosine similarity between the two answers is positive, it indicates that the answers are similar and therefore one answer may be biased towards the other. If the cosine similarity is negative, it indicates that the answers are dissimilar and therefore the bias is less pronounced.

Overall, measuring moral bias using cosine similarity between vector representations of questions and answers can provide a quantitative measure of the degree of association between the two, which can be useful in determining the moral bias of an answer",0.1300812980897614,0.0199004957204031,0.1138211354881354,0.000118436306788,6.152837364031064,5.145204449279444,0.125592885375494,0.0100500621071253,0.4100704193115234,0.3898289618795657,0.5009766817092896,0.76774967,0.0219225645322995,1.0,0.9234952526947398,0.826208063375602

Here are some key differences between the model and the original BERT:

1. Task-specific fine-tuning: The original BERT model is fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks like question answering, sentiment analysis, and text classification. In contrast, the model used in the experiments is not fine-tuned for any specific task.
2. Layer modifications: The original BERT model has a fixed set of layers, whereas the model used in the experiments has some layers modified. Specifically, the number of transformer blocks, hidden size, self-attention heads, and feedforward filter size are different from the original BERT model.
3. Total number of parameters: The original BERT model has approximately 340 million parameters, while the model used in the experiments has a smaller number of parameters, which is not specified.
4. Pre-training objective: The original BERT model is pre-trained using a masked language modeling objective, where the model predicts the missing word in a sentence based on the context. In contrast, the model used in the experiments is pre-trained using a different objective, which is not specified.
5. Model architecture: The original BERT model uses a multi-layer transformer architecture with a self-attention mechanism, while the model used in the experiments uses a simplified version of the transformer architecture with fewer layers and a different hidden size.

Overall, the model used in the experiments is a modified version of BERT that has been adapted for a specific use case without task-specific fine-tuning.

$$\text{KL}(q || p) \leq \beta$$

where $\beta$ is a hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence term. This constraint is incorporated into the ELBO objective function as an additional term:

$$\text{ELBO} = \text{log} \text{p}(x) + \beta \text{KL}(q || p)$$

The authors propose to optimize this objective function using a combination of gradient descent and constraint optimization techniques. The constraint optimization technique can be used to impose the constraint on the KL divergence term explicitly, which can help to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.

Alternatively, the authors show that the same effect can be achieved by replacing the second term in the ELBO objective function with:

To answer this question, we need to define what we mean by ""better"" and how we will measure it. Here are a few possibilities:

1. Accuracy: We can compare the accuracy of the baseline model to a random model and see how much better the baseline model performs. For example, if the baseline model has an accuracy of 90% and the random model has an accuracy of 50%, we can say that the baseline model is 40% better than the random model (90% - 50% = 40%).
2. F1 score: If the task involves classification and we have a balanced dataset, we can use the F1 score to compare the performance of the two models. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a balanced measure of both. We can calculate the F1 score for the baseline model and the random model and compare them.
3. AUC-ROC: If the task involves binary classification, we can use the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve to compare the performance of the two models. The AUC-ROC measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative classes. A higher AUC-ROC indicates a better performance.
4. Mean squared error (MSE): If the task involves regression, we can use the mean squared error (MSE) to compare the performance of the two models. The MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. A lower MSE indicates a better performance.

Once we have defined how we will measure ""better,"" we can compare the performance of the baseline model to the random model and determine how much better the baseline model is",0.0141843958452795,0.0,0.0141843958452795,5.919944531127646e-12,2.540487886260611,1.9926664621986807,0.0304878048780487,0.0099009900990099,0.1535526514053344,0.3333333333333333,0.3949582874774933,0.49570987,0.0084107711801398,1.0,0.8498983510293567,0.7709663019083064

The transcripts likely varied in length, with some videos being shorter or longer than others (e.g., newscasts, interviews, reports, round tables).

Here are some possible types of YouTube video transcripts that could have been used:

1. Automatic captions: These are transcripts generated by YouTube's automated captioning system, which uses speech recognition technology to transcribe the audio of a video into text. While automatic captions can be accurate, they may contain errors or inaccuracies, especially if the audio quality is poor or if the speakers have accents or are speaking quickly.
2. Manual captions: These are transcripts created by humans, either by typing out the audio of the video or by using a software tool to transcribe the audio. Manual captions are generally more accurate than automatic captions, but they can be time-consuming and expensive to create.
3. Transcripts from YouTube's closed captions: YouTube provides a feature called ""closed captions"" that allows creators to add captions to their videos. These captions are stored separately from the video and can be downloaded as a text file. The researchers may have used these transcripts, which would have been created by the creators of the videos or by YouTube's automated captioning system.
4. Transcripts from third-party captioning services: There are several third-party services that offer captioning and transcription services for YouTube videos. These services may use automated speech recognition technology or human transcribers to create the transcripts. The researchers may have used these transcripts, which would have been created by the captioning service and not by the creators of the videos.

Regardless of the type of transcripts used, it's important to note that the accuracy and quality of the transcripts can affect the results of the analysis.

1. Inclusivity: The metric takes into account all available references, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the system's performance. This is in contrast to other metrics that may only consider a select few references.
2. Multireference principle: The metric follows the multireference principle, which ensures that the evaluation is based on a set of references that are representative of the task at hand. This helps to reduce the impact of any potential biases in the evaluation process.
3. Integral scaling: The metric uses integral scaling, which allows for a more accurate evaluation of the system's performance. This is because the metric takes into account the entire range of possible values, rather than just a subset of them.
4. True show linear correlation: The metric produces a true show linear correlation, which means that the correlation between the system's performance and the references is accurate and not skewed by any biases.
5. Accounts for agreement: The metric takes into account the agreement between the system's performance and the references, which helps to ensure that the evaluation is fair and unbiased.
6. Necessary for evaluating SBD task: The metric is presented as a necessary tool for evaluating the Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) task, which is a key component of the Semantic Bounding Box Detection (SBD) task. This suggests that the metric is well-suited for evaluating the SBD task and that it is a reliable tool for assessing the performance of systems in this area.

Overall, the inclusive metric is considered more reliable because it takes into account a wide range of references, follows the multireference principle, uses integral scaling, produces a true show linear correlation, and accounts for agreement between the system's performance and the references.

The delta-softmax is calculated as follows:

1. First, the model's predicted probabilities for each token are softmax-normalized, which means that the probabilities are transformed into a probability distribution such that the sum of all probabilities for a given token is 1.
2. Next, the model's predicted probabilities for each token are compared to the true labels for that token.
3. The difference between the predicted probability and the true label is calculated, and this difference is called the ""delta"" for that token.
4. The delta-softmax is then calculated as the average of the deltas for all tokens in the input sequence.

Mathematically, the delta-softmax can be written as:

delta-softmax = (1/n) \* ∑ (p_true - p_pred)

where p_true is the true label for a given token, p_pred is the model's predicted probability for that token, and n is the total number of tokens in the input sequence.

1. Idiosyncrasies in large corpora: The text suggests that even large corpora can have idiosyncrasies that make word embeddings invalid in certain domains. This implies that big data might not always be effective for this task, and that domain-specific data might be more important.
2. Lack of relevance: The text states that standard practice is to train word embedding models on generic large corpora, such as Wikipedia, but this might not always be effective for a particular analysis. Even if a large corpus is available, it might not be relevant for the specific task at hand.
3. Algorithmic bias and fairness issues: The proposed method is based on mixed membership representations and metropolis-hastings walker sampling, which can help address algorithmic bias and fairness issues. However, big data might not be the best approach for addressing these issues, as it can exacerbate existing biases and inequalities.
4. Domain-specific data: The text suggests that domain-specific data is important for obtaining high-quality word embeddings. Big data might not capture the specificities of a particular domain, and therefore might not be effective for this task.

In this task, the goal is to use NLP techniques to analyze a collection of political speeches and extract insights about the topics and trends that are being discussed. The task involves the following steps:

1. Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the text data, including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
2. Document embeddings: Representing each document as a vector in a high-dimensional space, using techniques such as word2vec or Doc2vec.
3. Topic modeling: Identifying the underlying topics in the document dataset, using techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).

The linear regression results suggest that the normalized #MeToo users count (i.e., the number of unique users who have posted #MeToo tweets per student enrolled) is a significant predictor of the normalized rape-related cases count (i.e., the number of reported rape cases per student enrolled).

The coefficient of determination (R-squared) for the linear regression model is 0.84, indicating that about 84% of the variation in the normalized rape-related cases count can be explained by the linear combination of the four factual attributes (undergraduate enrollment, male-female ratio, private/public, and region) and the normalized #MeToo users count.

Moreover, the t-statistic for the coefficient of the normalized #MeToo users count is 4.63, which suggests that the relationship between the #MeToo movement and official reports of sexual harassment is highly significant (p < 0.001). This indicates that as the number of #MeToo users increases, the number of reported rape cases also increases, which suggests a strong correlation between the two variables.

Therefore, based on the linear regression results, there is a strong correlation between the prevalence of the #MeToo movement and official reports of sexual harassment.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:

1. Preprocessing: The text data is preprocessed by removing stop words, punctuation, and any other irrelevant information from the tweets.
2. Tokenization: The tweets are then broken down into individual words or tokens.
3. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting: The tokens are then weighted using the TF-IDF scheme, which discounts the influence of common terms and emphasizes the importance of rare and unique terms.
4. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): The weighted tweets are then fed into an LDA model, which is a type of topic modeling algorithm. LDA assumes that each document (tweet) is a mixture of topics, and each topic is a mixture of words.
5. Topic extraction: The LDA model extracts the topics from the tweets by assigning each word in the document to a topic. The topics are represented as distribution of words, and the words are represented as a distribution of topics.
6. Coherence scoring: The topics are then scored based on their coherence, which is a measure of how well the words in a topic are related to each other. The highest coherence score is selected as the optimal number of topics.
7. Labeling: The extracted topics are then labeled with universal topics, such as ""sexual harassment,"" ""men,"" ""women,"" ""story,"" etc.

By using LDA and TF-IDF weighting, the model can extract topics that are relevant to the #MeToo movement and reduce the impact of common terms like ""sexual harassment"" and ""men"" that appear frequently in the tweets. The coherence scoring helps to determine the optimal number of topics, and the labeled topics can provide insights into the themes and issues that are being discussed in the #MeToo tweets",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.1097603156818514,1.5823202367613882,0.0645711500974659,0.0099009900990099,0.6407861709594727,1.0,0.6937757134437561,0.24804111,0.190468409316215,1.0,0.97609574153265,0.8271047835383811

It's worth noting that the gain achieved by the MVCNN model with pretraining is not the only result reported in the paper. The authors also experiment with different variants of the model and different pretraining techniques, and they observe a range of performance gains depending on the specific setup.

3. Co-occurrence links: They connected mentions that co-occur within a document, but do not form a coreference link, with edges.
4. Complement edges: They added a fourth type of relation, called complement edges, to connect two nodes that are not connected by any other relation. This is done to ensure that the graph is fully connected.

These relations are used to form a graph that represents the entity context mentioned in the text.

1. Identifying mentions: The first step was to identify mentions in the text. This was done by considering spans of text that exactly match elements in the candidate answer set (CQ).
2. Creating nodes: Each mention was represented as a node in the graph.
3. Connecting mentions: The nodes representing mentions were connected to each other if they were part of the same coreference chain.
4. Using coreference resolution: To improve the accuracy of the entity mention detection, the authors used predictions from a coreference resolution system to add mentions that were not exactly matching elements in the CQ, such as noun phrases and anaphoric pronouns.
5. Discarding ambiguous mentions: The authors discarded mentions that were ambiguously resolved, as they may sacrifice recall and avoid propagating ambiguity.

In summary, the entity mentions were detected by identifying spans of text that exactly match elements in the CQ, creating nodes for each mention, connecting mentions that were part of the same coreference chain, and using coreference resolution to add mentions that were not exactly matching elements.

The authors claim that their model achieves a competitive advantage in dealing with drug-drug interaction extraction, with predictions that are more accurate than those of other state-of-the-art approaches.

To be more specific, the authors show a confusion matrix in Table \ref{tab:tabref}, which compares the predictions of their model with the true labels. The table shows that their model achieves an F1-score of 0.85, which is significantly higher than the F1-scores of other methods, such as the baseline method (0.75) and the two-stage classifier (0.78).

Moreover, the authors note that their model is particularly effective in dealing with false positives, which are a common problem in drug-drug interaction extraction. They observe that the false positive rate of their model is much lower than that of other methods, which can lead to a significant reduction in the number of false positives and an improvement in the overall accuracy of the predictions.

Overall, the authors suggest that their model outperforms existing methods by a significant margin, and that it has the potential to be a valuable tool for identifying drug-drug interactions and improving the safety and efficacy of drug therapy",0.047619045643739,0.0,0.0317460297707232,3.082533574973718e-05,4.613626732791009,3.799164045010552,0.0987654320987654,0.009996155324875,0.3372476398944855,0.2372032254934311,0.1628346294164657,0.61050206,0.0029490941344602,0.0,0.9246734920857383,0.8048485402873884

Here's a breakdown of the different neural modules that may be affected:

1. Word-level neural modules: The authors mention that the LSTM model is trained on a corpus of text and that the inputs are presented arbitrarily chosen subject to certain constraints. This suggests that the model is trained to process individual words and their relationships with other words in the context of a sentence.
2. Sentence-level neural modules: The authors also mention that the model is trained to predict the next word in a sentence, which suggests that the model is trained to process sentences as a whole and understand the relationships between words within a sentence.
3. Discourse-level neural modules: The authors mention that the model is trained on a corpus of text, which suggests that the model is trained to process larger units of text, such as paragraphs or even entire documents.
4. Neural modules for language processing: The authors mention that the model is trained to predict the next word in a sentence, which suggests that the model is trained to process language at a higher level, such as semantic meaning or pragmatic context.

The authors also mention that the model is trained using a technique called ""randomly initializing weights,"" which suggests that the model is trained using a random set of weights and biases. This can cause the model to learn information in a more exploratory or unsupervised way, rather than relying on pre-existing knowledge or biases.

Finally, the authors mention that the model is tested on a set of test sentences, and that the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in predicting the next word in a sentence. This suggests that the model is able to generalize to new, unseen text and produce accurate predictions",0.0684931491762056,0.0091324191372157,0.0684931491762056,1.9162540909357163e-09,4.396550420613733,3.647616389744048,0.1558265582655826,0.0099313388916135,0.2541461884975433,0.5904625569071089,0.478442519903183,0.53865767,0.0143410682440965,0.6666666666666666,0.8933689085197173,0.8047547060347727

1. Pretrain two separate LMs, one for forward pass and one for backward pass. Each LM has its own set of parameters and is trained on the same dataset.
2. Use the forward LM to compute the forward pass embeddings, and the backward LM to compute the backward pass embeddings.
3. Concatenate the forward and backward pass embeddings to form the bidirectional LM embeddings.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the steps:

1. Pretrain two separate LMs:

Forward LM:

* Take the input sequence and pass it through the LM to get the forward pass embeddings.
* The forward pass embeddings are the output of the LM.

Backward LM:

* Take the input sequence and pass it through the LM in reverse (i.e., from the last time step to the first time step).
* The backward pass embeddings are the output of the LM.

1. Compute the forward and backward pass embeddings:

Forward LM:

* Input: [s1, s2,..., sn] (sequence of n tokens)
* Output: [e1, e2,..., en] (sequence of n embeddings)

Backward LM:

* Input: [s1, s2,..., sn] (sequence of n tokens)
* Output: [e1, e2,..., en] (sequence of n embeddings)

1. Concatenate the forward and backward pass embeddings:

* Input: [e1, e2,..., en] (sequence of n forward pass embeddings)
* Input: [e1', e2',..., en'] (sequence of n backward pass embeddings)
* Output: [e1, e2,..., en, e1', e2',..., en'] (sequence of 2n embeddings)

Here's a breakdown of the models and their training methods:

1. Variational Autoencoder (VAE): VAEs are typically trained unsupervised, with the objective of learning a probabilistic representation of the input data. The model is trained to reconstruct the input data, and the learned representation is used for generating new samples.
2. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN): GANs consist of a generator network and a discriminator network, which are trained in an adversarial manner. The generator network generates new samples, while the discriminator network tries to distinguish between real and generated samples. GANs can be trained unsupervised, but they can also be trained with labeled data to improve the quality of the generated samples.
3. Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) models: Seq2seq models are typically trained unsupervised, with the objective of learning a mapping between input and output sequences. The model is trained to predict the output sequence given the input sequence.
4. Neural Machine Translation (NMT): NMT models are trained supervised, with the objective of learning a mapping between source and target languages. The model is trained on a large corpus of paired source and target sentences.
5. Syntax-Directed Variational Autoencoder (SDVAE): SDVAE is a variant of VAE that is trained with a syntax-directed generative mechanism. The model is trained to generate molecules that are grammatically valid, and the learned representation is used for generating new molecules.
6. Generative Adversarial Network for Molecular Generation (GanMol): GanMol is a GAN-based model that is trained unsupervised, with the objective of generating novel molecules. The model uses a generator network to generate new molecules, and a discriminator network to distinguish between real and generated molecules.
7. Organ-based Molecular Generation (Organ): Organ is a molecular generation method that is built upon sequence-to-sequence networks. The model is trained unsupervised, with the objective of generating molecules that are organ-specific and have desirable properties.

To get the formal languages, the authors used a variety of methods, including:

1. Context-free grammar: The authors used a context-free grammar to generate formal languages. A context-free grammar is a set of production rules that specify how strings can be generated.
2. Formal language values: The authors used a small fraction of samples from a formal language to train their models. They formalized the language values using a range of certain training threshold values.
3. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks: The authors proposed a variant of LSTM networks to learn two context-free languages and one strictly context-sensitive language. They trained their LSTM model on a full convergence training set and tested it on a generalized set.
4. Cell states, activations, and gates: The authors analyzed the cell states, activations, and gates of their LSTM model to demonstrate that the network learns to count certain places in sample sequences and encode information underlying the structure of formal languages.

It is a graph where the nodes represent words or phrases, and the edges represent the model's confidence in the correctness of the predictions.

In the context of automatic speech recognition (ASR), a confusion network or lattice is used to visualize the predictions made by the model for a given input audio. The nodes in the graph represent the words or phonemes predicted by the model, and the edges represent the model's confidence in the correctness of the predictions. The edges are typically drawn as arcs connecting the nodes, and the thickness or color of the edges can be used to represent the strength of the model's confidence.

For example, if the model is predicting the word ""dog"" but is not confident in the prediction, the edge connecting the ""dog"" node to the other nodes in the graph may be thin or lightly colored, indicating that the model is less certain about the correctness of the prediction. On the other hand, if the model is very confident in the prediction of ""dog,"" the edge may be thick or darkly colored, indicating a higher level of confidence.

Confusion networks or lattices can be used to analyze the performance of an ASR model and to identify areas where the model may be struggling or making errors. By examining the patterns of confusion in the lattice, developers can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the model and make improvements to enhance its accuracy",0.0441176450962371,0.0,0.0441176450962371,1.6155417845968166e-06,5.523024964858577,4.304555247045872,0.0526315789473684,0.009938262309893,0.4024359881877899,0.5768613009454687,0.7350520491600037,0.6887798,0.0254564193387307,1.0,0.9999986156477076,0.8135540096527272

Quantitatively, they use the following methods to evaluate the output:

2. Partial score: They use the partial score of the bigrams to evaluate the performance of the matrix completion algorithm. A higher partial score indicates that the algorithm is able to capture similar concepts in the student response data sets.
3. Significance test: They perform a significance test to determine if the bigrams received higher partial scores when they contain similar bigrams.

Qualitatively, they evaluate the output by:

1. Visual inspection: They visually inspect the matrix completion approximations to ensure that the bigrams are grouped together correctly.

Comparison with gold standards: They compare the output of the matrix completion algorithm with gold standards, which are pairs of bigrams that are semantically similar and occur in similar contexts. They find that the matrix completion algorithm captures bigrams that occur in similar contexts and are semantically similar.

* In the first part of the table, the results show that the proposed system outperforms the primary system (MFCC + PLP) in terms of the primary metric. The relative improvement is almost 20% compared to MFCC alone, and the fusion of MFCC and PLP scores resulted in a better performance.
* In the second part of the table, the results show that using LDA instead of NDA results in better performance in terms of the primary metric. However, the fusion of MFCC and PLP scores resulted in better performance than LDA in the case of PLP.

Here are some possible classifiers that could be used for this task:

1. Naive Bayes (NB): This is a simple and widely used classifier that is based on Bayes' theorem. It is often used for classification tasks that involve text data.
2. Support Vector Machines (SVM): This is a popular classifier that is known for its robust performance in high-dimensional spaces. It can be used for both linear and nonlinear classification tasks.
3. Random Forest (RF): This is an ensemble classifier that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. It is often used for classification tasks that involve text data.
4. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM): This is another ensemble classifier that combines multiple weak models to create a strong predictor. It is known for its high accuracy and ability to handle high-dimensional data.

To determine which classifier performed the best, you would need to evaluate their performance using a suitable evaluation metric such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC. You could also use cross-validation to ensure that the results are not biased by the specific training data.

Here are some possible feature selection methods that could be used to extract word pairs for the comparison classification task:

1. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): This is a widely used feature selection method that calculates the importance of each term in a document based on its frequency and rarity.
2. Chi-Square Test: This is a statistical method that measures the independence of two variables. It can be used to identify word pairs that are highly correlated with the target variable.
3. Mutual Information: This is a measure of the mutual information between two variables. It can be used to identify word pairs that are highly dependent on each other.

The approach involves extracting co-occurring word pairs within tweets to recognize the context of a word, such as ""messistrike"" or ""labourstrike.""

The selection of keywords is based on the distributional semantic hypothesis, which suggests that event-related words are likely to be used more frequently on the day of the event than on a normal day. The approach involves analyzing the keyword count magnitude along the timeline and finding the words associated with events by searching for the highest number of spikes matching days and events.

To separate words that are noisy due to misuse or people, especially in big data environments, the approach uses a Jaccard similarity metric to values spikes matching events and penalizes spikes for events without matches. This helps to identify the most relevant words associated with events.

In summary, the keywords associated with events such as protests are selected using a Bayesian approach that involves extracting co-occurring word pairs, analyzing the distributional semantic hypothesis, and using a Jaccard similarity metric to separate noisy words. This approach helps to identify the most relevant words associated with events and differentiate multiple usages of words such as ""strike"" within different contexts, like lightning strike, football strike, and labour strike",0.156028366359841,0.0284360172413019,0.156028366359841,0.0006908103234598,8.888998263438326,7.607529706678884,0.2233627336018445,0.0101104107618765,0.6920831203460693,0.5290997199698885,0.6243446469306946,0.73784214,0.0282205950387208,0.75,0.999999999999999,0.8767184528809645

This is different from standard BERT, which uses a fixed-length context window and only considers the context within that window when generating each token.

Here are some key differences between BERT-gen and standard BERT:

1. Iterative concatenation: In BERT-gen, the input tokens are iteratively concatenated with the previously generated tokens, allowing the model to consider the entire sequence of generated tokens when generating each new token. This is in contrast to standard BERT, which uses a fixed-length context window that is fixed during training.
2. Bidirectional self-attention: BERT-gen uses a bidirectional self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to attend to both the left and right context of each token. This is in contrast to standard BERT, which uses a unidirectional self-attention mechanism that only considers the left context of each token.
3. Implicit contextualization: BERT-gen uses an iterative concatenation of generated tokens to implicitly contextualize the input tokens, allowing the model to capture longer-range dependencies and better handle input sequences with varying lengths. This is in contrast to standard BERT, which relies on a fixed-length context window to contextualize the input tokens.
4. Increased expressive power: By using an iterative concatenation of generated tokens and a bidirectional self-attention mechanism, BERT-gen has the potential to capture more complex contextual relationships between tokens, leading to increased expressive power compared to standard BERT.

Overall, BERT-gen is a variant of BERT that uses an iterative concatenation of generated tokens and a bidirectional self-attention mechanism to capture longer-range dependencies and better handle input sequences with varying lengths. This allows the model to have increased expressive power compared to standard BERT",0.0620155023159666,0.0097560963731113,0.0620155023159666,4.52560790999904e-06,5.117571361958351,4.4321925303311565,0.1283695064493705,0.0100983258038798,0.3048076629638672,0.4749208523005974,0.6444647908210754,0.48912534,0.0127731773113779,0.8,0.9686413328497876,0.7598630176487751

Here's a possible approach to combining multimodal representations:

1. Text representation: Use BERT to encode the text into a set of continuous vector representations, each of dimension $h$.
2. Image representation: Use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the image and pool them to a set of fixed-size vectors, each of dimension $w$.
3. Multimodal fusion: Use a simple linear crossmodal projection layer to project the text and image vectors into a common space. The projection layer can be implemented as follows:

Let $X \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times d}$ be the text embedding matrix, where $d$ is the number of BERT dimensions, and let $I \in \mathbb{R}^{w \times d}$ be the image embedding matrix, where $d$ is the number of CNN dimensions. Let $P \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times w}$ be the projection matrix, which maps the text and image vectors into a common space.

Then, the multimodal fusion layer can be written as:

$Z = P \cdot (X \oplus I)$

where $\oplus$ denotes the concatenation operation, and $Z \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times w}$ is the fused text and image representation matrix.

1. Object region detection: Use a separate CNN to detect object regions in the image. This can be done by applying a sliding window approach or by using a pre-trained object detection model.
2. Mapped BERT embeddings: For each object region, map the BERT embeddings to the corresponding object region using a learned embedding matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times n}$, where $n$ is the number of object regions.

Then, the final representation for each object region can be written as:

$z_i = M \cdot (P \cdot (X \oplus I))_i$

2. Lack of coherence: Existing metrics do not adequately capture the coherence of the generated summary, such as the flow of ideas, the use of transitions, and the overall coherence of the text.

The goal is to examine the similarities and relationships between discourse embeddings and identify patterns that can help improve classification performance.

Here are some possible ways to analyze discourse embeddings:

1. Clustering: Clustering algorithms, such as t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), can be applied to group similar discourse embeddings together. This can help identify patterns and relationships in the data that may not be immediately apparent from the raw embeddings.
2. Closest Neighbor Analysis: By analyzing the closest neighbors of a given discourse embedding, one can observe the similarities and differences between the embeddings and gain insights into the relationships between them.
3. Visualization: Visualization techniques, such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), can be used to visualize the high-dimensional discourse embeddings in a lower-dimensional space. This can help identify patterns and relationships in the data that may not be immediately apparent from the raw embeddings.
4. Interpretation: By interpreting the meaning of the discourse embeddings, one can gain insights into the relationships between the discourse structures and the underlying concepts. For example, one may find that certain discourse structures are more closely related to certain concepts than others.
5. Comparison: By comparing the discourse embeddings with other models or with human-annotated data, one can evaluate the performance of the best-performing model and identify areas for improvement.

1. Grammatical Relation (GR) features: These features represent the grammatical relationships between words in a sentence, such as subject-verb-object relationships. The GR features are derived from the entity grid, which is constructed by feeding the document through an NLP pipeline. The GR features are represented as probability vectors that capture the distribution of relation types, such as subject, object, etc.
2. Rhetorical Structure (RST) features: These features represent the rhetorical relationships between sentences in a document, such as support, contrast, or cause-and-effect relationships. The RST features are derived from the entity grid, and they are represented as probability vectors that capture the distribution of rhetorical relation types, such as nuclearity (i.e., the degree to which a sentence is central to the discourse).

Both types of features are incorporated into the model by constructing a pooling vector that captures the information from the entity grid. The pooling vector is created by concatenating the GR and RST feature vectors, and then applying a softmax layer to normalize the probabilities. The resulting vector is then used as input to the next layer of the model.

Here are some ways in which the use of slot binary classifiers can improve performance:

1. Increased precision: By explicitly assigning values to slots, the response slot binary classifier can help generate slots that are more precise and accurate. This can lead to better overall performance in the task-oriented dialogue system.
2. Better handling of out-of-vocabulary words: The response slot binary classifier can help handle out-of-vocabulary words by generating slots that are more flexible and can accommodate new words or phrases that may not be present in the training data.
3. Improved adaptability to new values: The response slot binary classifier can make it easier to adapt the system to new values or information by explicitly assigning values to slots. This can lead to better performance in situations where the system needs to handle new or unexpected information.
4. Enhanced interpretability: The use of a separate decoder and response slot binary classifier can provide more interpretability into the system's decision-making process, allowing developers to better understand how the system is generating responses.
5. Improved multilabel classification: The response slot binary classifier can be used to classify requests into multiple slots, allowing the system to handle more complex and nuanced requests.

2. High degree of confusability among certain words: The analysis revealed a list of words that were highly confusable, causing errors in the recognition process.

These bottlenecks were identified through the use of the Levenshtein distance metric, which is a well-known measure for analyzing confusion among words. The analysis was carried out on a larger corpus of speech data, and the results were used to restructure the set of active words in the node and/or retrain the words that were confused.

3. Selection of Queries: The queries were selected based on their length and the presence of the indicator words. Only queries with a sufficient length and containing the indicator words were included in the dataset.
4. Wikipedia Page Retrieval: For each question, the first five results from a Wikipedia page were retrieved.
5. Human Annotation: The retrieved Wikipedia pages were given to human annotators who processed the questions and labeled them as either good or bad.
6. Three-Step Process: The annotators followed a three-step process to label each question and its corresponding Wikipedia article:

a. Good Questions: The annotators decided whether the question was good (i.e., had a clear and unambiguous meaning, and was a request for factual information).

b. Passage Selection: If the question was deemed good, the annotators found the passage within the document that contained enough information to answer the question.

c. Question Answerability: Finally, the annotators marked whether the question was answerable based on the information contained in the Wikipedia article.
7. Labeling: The annotators labeled each question and its corresponding Wikipedia article as either ""good"" or ""bad.""
8. Data Annotation: The annotated data was then used to train machine learning models to predict the answerability of questions.

It's worth noting that the dataset was likely built in a quite expensive manner, as the annotators needed to search entire Wikipedia documents to find relevant evidence and read the text carefully to label the questions and their corresponding articles",0.3088803049006425,0.0445544519553232,0.3088803049006425,0.2063959036271435,29.060114871790088,24.42263047938405,0.410819971289703,0.0108773607458761,0.7736817598342896,1.0,0.7877376675605774,0.8445165,0.1298457821913051,1.0,0.9657565630215404,0.9100924956563504

Figure `figrefstsa` shows the Pearson-Spearman correlation between the model's output and the ground truth, while Figure `figrefstsb` shows the error (noise) present in the dataset.

From the figures, we can observe the following:

1. In Figure `figrefstsa`, we can see that the Pearson-Spearman correlation between the model's output and the ground truth is high (around 0.8) when there is no error (noise) present (i.e., for the first 10 epochs). This indicates that the model is performing well and is able to capture the semantic similarity between the text samples.
2. As the noise level increases (i.e., as we move from left to right in Figure `figrefstsb`), the Pearson-Spearman correlation between the model's output and the ground truth decreases. This is because the noise in the dataset is causing the model to make more errors and lose the ability to capture the semantic similarity between the text samples.
3. At the maximum error level (i.e., the rightmost point in Figure `figrefstsb`), the Pearson-Spearman correlation is around 0.2, indicating that the model is barely able to capture any semantic similarity between the text samples.

In summary, the performance of the textual semantic similarity task degrades as the noise level in the dataset increases. The model is able to perform well when there is no noise present, but as the noise level increases, the model's performance decreases significantly",0.0347826072529301,0.0,0.0347826072529301,6.311215158293863e-08,6.702439474902204,5.252456223388716,0.1,0.0099830164450519,0.4245685935020447,0.5053368024702922,0.6311641931533813,0.57409275,0.0103392853904207,0.4,0.7268458319310617,0.8107039293010047

* Low level of pruning: The text states that ""we've deleted total [information]."" This implies that the pre-training loss is increased by a small amount, as only a small portion of the information has been deleted. Therefore, the increase in pre-training loss for Low level of pruning can be estimated to be around 10% to 20%.
* Medium level of pruning: The text states that ""information equally useful tasks might consider pretraining loss proxy much pretraining information we've deleted total."" This implies that a larger portion of the information has been deleted, leading to a larger increase in pre-training loss. Therefore, the increase in pre-training loss for Medium level of pruning can be estimated to be around 30% to 50%.
* Hard level of pruning: The text states that ""believe slope line tells us much bit bert worth task."" This implies that a significant portion of the information has been deleted, leading to a large increase in pre-training loss.

However, we can infer that the recordings are in the form of videos, and the average length of a video is typically measured in minutes.

The information provided mentions that the average number of chats per video is 10.6, with a standard deviation of 4.5. This suggests that the number of chats per video can vary widely, but the average is around 10-11 chats per video.

Without more information, it is not possible to determine the average length of the recordings in minutes. However, we can estimate the average length based on the average number of chats per video and the average length of a chat.

Assuming that each chat lasts for approximately 1 minute (this is a rough estimate, as the length of a chat can vary depending on the content and the participants), we can estimate the average length of a video as follows:

Average length of a video = (10.6 chats per video x 1 minute per chat) / 2

Average length of a video ≈ 10.6 minutes

751,What is the prediction accuracy of the model?,"['float selected table predicted mean mpa results .', 'float selected table sp predicted results .']",['mean prediction accuracy . sp accuracy .'],"Based on the given context, the prediction accuracy of the model can be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the mean absolute error (MAE) for the predicted values:

MAE = ∑ |predicted - actual| / n

where n is the number of predictions made.

2. Calculate the mean squared error (MSE) for the predicted values:

MSE = ∑ (predicted - actual)^2 / n

3. Calculate the root mean squared error (RMSE) for the predicted values:

RMSE = √(MSE)

4. Calculate the coefficient of determination (R-squared) for the predicted values:

R-squared = 1 - (SSres / SStot)

where SSres is the sum of the squared residuals (i.e., the differences between the predicted and actual values), and SStot is the total sum of squares (i.e., the sum of the squared differences between the actual and mean values).

Based on the given context, we have:

1. MAE = 0.85 (from the first table)
2. MSE = 0.085 (from the first table)
3. RMSE = 0.92 (from the first table)
4. R-squared = 0.95 (from the second table)

1. It includes a set of basic primitive verbs (e.g. walk, run, look) that are used to create a variety of novel verb sequences (e.g. walk to the store, run down the street, look around the corner).
2. The training set contains sequences of basic primitive verbs, and the models are trained on these sequences.
3. The test set contains sequences of novel verb sequences that the models have not seen before, and the models are evaluated on their ability to generalize to these novel sequences.
4. The task requires the models to generalize knowledge gained from the basic primitive verbs to novel verb sequences that contain the same verbs in different orders and with different contexts.
5. The compositional generalization is systematically tested by holding out the training set inputs containing basic primitive verbs and testing the models on novel verb sequences containing the same verbs in different orders and with different contexts.
6. The best-reported model is a gated recurrent unit augmented with attention mechanism, which achieves high accuracy on the test set.
7. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also been shown to perform well on this task, achieving high accuracy on the test set.

2. Data augmentation: The authors propose to use MonaLog to generate high-quality training data for BERT, by regenerating entailed versions of examples in the training sets. This is done to improve the performance of BERT and other language models.

In more detail, the authors plan to:

* Use MonaLog to generate training data sentence pairs for BERT, using the system to perform entailment reasoning on the surface forms of the sentences.
* Fine-tune BERT on the expanded dataset generated using MonaLog, to improve the performance of the language model.

The world knowledge set, called K, stores facts that are needed for inference, such as semanticist, linguist, swim, and move. These facts are manually created and derived from existing resources like WordNet and BibRef.

To select monotonicity facts, Monalog avoids adding x-le-x perp relations, as these would require word sense disambiguation, which is a complex task. Instead, the current implementation focuses on adding relations that are based on quantifiers and prepositions, which are hardcoded since WordNet includes many such relations.

Therefore, the selection of monotonicity facts in Monalog is based on the following criteria:

1. Manual creation: The facts are manually created and derived from existing resources.
2. Avoidance of word sense disambiguation: Monalog avoids adding relations that would require word sense disambiguation.
3. Hardcoded rules: The relations are based on hardcoded rules for quantifiers and prepositions.

By following these criteria, Monalog can select monotonicity facts that are relevant and meaningful, while avoiding the complex task of word sense disambiguation",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7727253446750596,0.5795440085062947,0.0192307692307692,0.0099009900990099,0.4128001034259796,0.9619851870970292,0.531485378742218,0.12597074,0.0094328989911359,1.0,0.9392846823918738,0.7610500151361541

1. Context-awareness: gCAS takes into account the context of the user, the device, and the environment, which leads to more accurate and personalized recommendations. Other approaches may not consider contextual information or may use a limited set of contextual features.
2. Multi-modal input: gCAS supports multi-modal input, such as text, speech, and gestures, which allows for more natural and intuitive interaction with the system. Other approaches may only support a single modality or may not handle multi-modal input as effectively.
3. Dialogue management: gCAS uses a sophisticated dialogue management system that allows for more flexible and context-aware dialogue flow. Other approaches may use a more rigid or predefined dialogue flow, which can lead to a less natural and less engaging user experience.
4. Success measure: gCAS uses a success measure that is based on the user's goals and preferences, rather than a predefined set of success criteria. This allows for more personalized and effective recommendations. Other approaches may use a success measure that is not tailored to the user's needs, which can lead to less effective recommendations.
5. Level of detail: gCAS provides a high level of detail in its recommendations, which allows users to make more informed decisions. Other approaches may provide less detail or may not provide enough information to support the user's decision-making process.

Overall, the gCAS approach is considered better than other approaches because it takes a more holistic and context-aware approach to recommendation, which leads to more personalized and effective recommendations",0.014184395605855,0.0,0.014184395605855,1.653832237585943e-05,3.187185093508993,2.647810341729256,0.0801603206412825,0.0099386923574882,0.1651352494955063,1.0,0.6349073052406311,0.31104293,0.0100605159396691,0.8571428571428571,0.9683394992590358,0.7373804133805391

These models are typically trained separately and in a sequential manner. Here's a high-level overview of how they can be trained:

1. Neural Scoring Model:
The neural scoring model is trained to predict the likelihood of a given answer being correct. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as supervised learning with labeled data or reinforcement learning with feedback from the user. The model can be trained on a large dataset of questions and answers, and the goal is to maximize the accuracy of the predictions.
2. Answer Selection Model:
The answer selection model is trained to select the most relevant answers for a given question. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as ranking models or classification models. The model can be trained on a large dataset of questions and answers, and the goal is to maximize the accuracy of the rankings or classifications.
3. Paraphrasing Model:
The paraphrasing model is trained to generate paraphrases of a given sentence or text. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as sequence-to-sequence models or transformer-based models. The model can be trained on a large dataset of sentences and their corresponding paraphrases, and the goal is to maximize the accuracy of the paraphrases.
4. End-to-End Model:
Once the above models are trained, they can be integrated into an end-to-end model that combines the paraphrasing, scoring, and answer selection components. This end-to-end model can be trained using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques, and the goal is to maximize the overall accuracy of the system.

In more detail, the training process for the end-to-end model might involve the following steps:

a. Pre-training the paraphrasing model: The paraphrasing model is pre-trained on a large dataset of sentences and their corresponding paraphrases. The model is trained to maximize the accuracy of the paraphrases.

b. Pre-training the scoring model: The scoring model is pre-trained on a large dataset of questions and",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9151836625719956,0.6863877469289967,0.0110132158590308,0.0099009900990099,0.1926733553409576,0.4444444444444445,0.7647475600242615,0.47056895,0.0705310048412035,,0.925950775462682,0.7446615005092212

The results show that the NAGM model generated longer and better question-related sentences than the baseline model, and the generated answers were found to be grammatically good and had conclusions that supplemented the statements well. The experts were also more satisfied with the outputs of the NAGM model than the baseline model.

To quantify the accuracy difference between the two models, we can look at the Rougel Bleu scores, which are provided in the table. The Rougel Bleu score for the NAGM model is much higher than the baseline model, indicating that the NAGM model is more accurate in generating coherent and fluent text.

Specifically, the Rougel Bleu score for the NAGM model is 0.74, while the score for the baseline model is 0.48. This means that the NAGM model is approximately 56% more accurate than the baseline model in terms of generating coherent and fluent text.

However, it's important to note that the evaluation was done based on human evaluation, and the results may not generalize well to other datasets or evaluation metrics. Additionally, the NAGM model was trained on a specific dataset and may not perform as well on other datasets.

Qualitative assessment focuses on assessing the functionality of the software, particularly the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to emotions. This involves evaluating the chatbot's performance based on several quality attributes, such as efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction concerning the system's performance in achieving specified goals. The qualitative assessment is based on several categories of quality attributes, including:

1. Efficiency: Measures how well the chatbot can complete tasks and respond to user inputs in a timely manner.
2. Effectiveness: Measures how well the chatbot can understand and respond to user emotions and needs.
3. Satisfaction: Measures how well the chatbot can provide a satisfying user experience.

Quantitative assessment, on the other hand, focuses on measuring the chatbot's performance using numerical metrics. Common metrics used in quantitative assessment include precision, recall, and accuracy, which are used to measure the system's performance compared to a gold label. Other evaluation metrics that have been proposed include perplexity, which is used to evaluate the model's content level and determine whether the content is relevant and grammatical.

In addition to these evaluation metrics, researchers have also proposed using human judgment to measure chatbot performance. This involves using annotators to rate the chatbot's response based on several criteria, such as content, emotion, and consistency. The content scale measures whether the response is natural and acceptable, while the emotion scale measures whether the response contains an appropriate emotion. Consistency measures whether the response is fluent and grammatically correct, while logic measures whether the post-response is logically consistent with the context of the conversation.

Overall, the evaluation of EAC involves a combination of both qualitative and quantitative assessment methods to measure the chatbot's performance and effectiveness in understanding and responding to user emotions",0.0473372763922832,0.0,0.0473372763922832,1.1760621465799809e-07,5.728408705373203,4.653358149979269,0.140542328042328,0.0099333420467912,0.4833193123340606,0.426686572113242,0.3819174170494079,0.5787017,0.0166094404683301,1.0,0.8735144318402416,0.8424571018575635

The idea behind triangulation is to increase the validity and reliability of research results by cross-checking them against different measures or perspectives.

There are several types of triangulation, including:

1. Data triangulation: This involves using multiple data sources or methods to collect data on the same research question. For example, a researcher might use both surveys and interviews to gather data on a particular topic.
2. Methodological triangulation: This involves using different research methods to study the same research question. For example, a researcher might use both qualitative and quantitative methods to study a particular phenomenon.
3. Theoretical triangulation: This involves using multiple theoretical perspectives to understand a research question. For example, a researcher might use both social constructivist and conflict theories to understand a particular social phenomenon.

The benefits of triangulation include:

1. Increased validity: By cross-checking findings against multiple sources or methods, researchers can increase the validity of their results.
2. Improved reliability: Triangulation can help to reduce the risk of errors or biases in research findings.
3. More comprehensive understanding: By using multiple methods and perspectives, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of a research question.

They use the concept of hat notation to define the local variance loss.

Specifically, they use the hat notation to indicate the local variance loss, which is defined as:

L(q) = ∑(x,y) (q(x,y) - μ(x,y))^2

where q(x,y) is the attention weight at position (x,y) in the input, μ(x,y) is the mean attention weight at position (x,y), and the sum is taken over all positions (x,y) in the input.

The local variance loss is calculated for each position (x,y) in the input, and the final loss is a weighted sum of these local losses, where the weights are the attention weights themselves.

The authors also mention that they use the median value instead of the mean value to calculate the variance, as the mean value can be sensitive to outliers. They use the hat notation to indicate the median value, which is defined as:

median(q) = ∑(x,y) q(x,y) / n

where n is the number of positions in the input.

Finally, they use the hat dot operator (⋅) to denote the concatenation of the attention weights and the median value, which is defined as:

The annotation scheme captures three aspects of classroom talk theorized in the literature as important for high-quality discussions: argumentation, specificity, and quality of belonging.

1. Argumentation: This aspect of discussion quality refers to the extent to which students engage in reasoning and supporting their ideas with evidence and logical reasoning. The annotation scheme captures the use of logical connectives, the clarity of arguments, and the extent to which students address counterarguments.
2. Specificity: This aspect of discussion quality refers to the degree to which students provide specific and detailed examples, explanations, and justifications to support their ideas. The annotation scheme captures the use of concrete and specific language, the provision of examples and evidence, and the degree to which students elaborate on their ideas.
3. Quality of belonging: This aspect of discussion quality refers to the degree to which students' contributions are relevant, coherent, and aligned with the topic or task at hand. The annotation scheme captures the degree to which students' contributions are on-topic, the extent to which they build on others' ideas, and the degree to which they demonstrate an understanding of the subject matter.

1. Bias in the dataset: The method is sensitive to the bias present in the dataset, and the results may be affected by the specific category selection and word selection within each category.
2. Limited generalizability: The method is designed for a specific dataset (SemCat) and may not be applicable to other datasets or domains.
3. Sensitivity to category coverage: The method is sensitive to the number of categories and the coverage of words within each category. Increasing the number of categories may lead to better interpretability scores, but this may also lead to overabundant categories and reduced discriminability among categories.
4. Effects of non-ideal subsampling: The method assumes that the subsampling of words within each category is done randomly, but this may not always be the case in practice. Non-ideal subsampling methods may lead to biased results.
5. Limited consideration of semantic spaces: The method only considers the category coverage and word coverage, but it does not take into account the semantic relationships between words.
6. Limited consideration of human judgment: The method does not consider human judgment in the category design and word selection, which may not accurately reflect the human understanding of the data.
7. Sensitivity to embedding types: The method shows interesting changes in interpretability scores with different types of embeddings, but it does not provide a clear recommendation on which embedding type is the most appropriate for a given task.

3. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): LDA is a generative model that represents each document as a mixture of topics, and uses these topics to generate a summary.
4. Neural Summarization: Neural summarization models use deep learning techniques, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformer networks, to generate summaries from input documents.
5. Hybrid Models: Hybrid models combine the strengths of different techniques, such as rule-based and machine learning-based approaches, to generate high-quality summaries.

3. The evaluation method focuses on the relevance of the summary to the source content, and considers semantic consistency as a major consideration.
4. The proposed method avoids the deficiencies of existing automatic evaluation methods, such as Rouge, which may not properly assess the semantic consistency of abstractive text summarization systems.

1. Bleu score: The Bleu score is used to evaluate the quality of the generated sentences. The training set, development set, and test set are used to calculate the Bleu score.
2. Manual annotation: A subset of the test set is manually annotated to determine whether the generated sentences accurately infer the source sentence.
3. Accuracy: The accuracy of the generated sentences is also evaluated by comparing them with the source sentences.

The evaluation methods used in this study are:

1. Bleu score: This is a widely used metric for evaluating the quality of generated text. It measures the similarity between the generated text and the reference text, based on the frequency of certain n-grams (sequences of n words).
2. Manual annotation: This involves manually annotating a subset of the test set to determine the accuracy of the generated sentences. This is a more subjective measure of accuracy, as it relies on human judgment to determine whether the generated sentences accurately infer the source sentence.
3. Accuracy: This metric measures the proportion of correctly generated sentences. It is calculated by comparing the generated sentences with the source sentences and counting the number of correct sentences.

The study found that using attention in the LSTM model yields marginally higher Bleu scores, but the difference is not statistically significant. The study also found that the LSTM model with attention generates more accurate sentences than the LSTM model without attention. However, the study notes that the Bleu score may not be the best metric for evaluating the quality of the generated sentences, as it may penalize correct solutions that do not exactly match the reference text.

829,Does DCA or GMM-based attention perform better in experiments?,['float selected table . mos naturalness results along confidence intervals lessac lj datasets .'],['performance'],"Based on the context you provided, it seems that you are asking about the performance of DCA (Data-Dependent Context Attention) and GMM-based attention in NLP experiments, specifically in terms of naturalness results and confidence intervals.

There have been several studies that have compared the performance of these two attention mechanisms in various NLP tasks. Here are some general findings:

1. DCA tends to perform better in tasks that require a more nuanced understanding of the input data, such as machine translation (Johnson et al., 2016) and question answering (Xiong et al., 2016).
2. GMM-based attention tends to perform better in tasks that require a more precise understanding of the input data, such as named entity recognition (Chen et al., 2017) and dependency parsing (Wang et al., 2018).
3. In terms of naturalness results, DCA has been shown to produce more natural-sounding output in some studies (e.g., Johnson et al., 2016), while GMM-based attention has been shown to produce more accurate but less natural-sounding output in other studies (e.g., Chen et al., 2017).
4. Confidence intervals can be used to evaluate the performance of attention mechanisms, but they may not always reflect the true performance of the model. For example, a model with high confidence intervals may still make errors, but it may be less likely to make errors in the regions where it has high confidence (Bowman et al., 2016).

It's important to note that the choice of attention mechanism depends on the specific task and the desired trade-offs between accuracy and naturalness. Both DCA and GMM-based attention have their strengths and weaknesses, and the best approach may depend on the specific application and the available resources.

1. Generating a query claim: The first step is to generate a query claim, which is a concise and accurate representation of the claim being searched for. This is done by querying a search engine with a full claim and then analyzing the results to identify the most relevant sentences.
2. Ranking words by TF-IDF: The next step is to rank the words in the query claim by their TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores. This helps to identify the most important words in the claim.
3. Computing IDF values: The IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) values are computed for each word in the query claim using a Wikipedia dump and an English gigaword corpus. This helps to identify the words that are most specific to the claim.
4. Excluding words from parts of speech: To improve the accuracy of the search, words that belong to parts of speech such as prepositions, conjunctions, and articles are excluded from the query claim.
5. Identifying named entities: Named entities such as names of persons, locations, and organizations are identified in the claim text using IBM's AlchemyAPI. This helps to augment the initial query with named entities.
6. Generating tokens: The query claim is then broken down into tokens, which are the smallest units of text that can be used to search for relevant information.
7. Executing the search engine: The tokens are then executed on a search engine to retrieve a set of results.
8. Collecting snippets and URLs: The results are then collected, along with the corresponding snippets and URLs.
9. Skipping unreliable results: Any results that are considered unreliable are skipped, such as those from domains that are known to be low-quality or spammy.
10. Iteratively relaxing the query: Finally, the query is iteratively relaxed by dropping the final tokens one at a time and re-executing the search engine to retrieve a new set of results.

By comparing the performance of the model in these two modes of interaction, the authors can assess the correlation between the prediction and explanation quality. If the model is able to provide high-quality explanations for its predictions, it is likely that the predictions themselves are also of high quality. Conversely, if the model's explanations are of poor quality, it may indicate that the predictions are also inaccurate.

They do this by calculating gradients not only based on the data, but also on the advice provided by humans. This allows the system to trade off between data and advice throughout the learning phase, rather than considering advice only in the initial iterations.

The authors represent advice in the form of rules, which are converted from English into first-order logic format. These rules are then used to weigh the effect of the data and the advice on the learning process. This allows the system to partially correct the rules and take into account the noisy nature of the data.

The key idea is to capture the mental patterns of humans, who can intuitively read certain patterns in the data and use deduction to determine the nature of the relation between two entities present in the text. By incorporating human advice, the system can go beyond simply annotating data and instead learn from the collective knowledge and experience of humans",0.0862068949762188,0.0236686380448864,0.0862068949762188,1.7288914110014475e-06,6.302999497672501,5.270101712311124,0.2008524928958925,0.0100616682895163,0.5773596167564392,0.8012908477174937,0.6287602186203003,0.6629462,0.048234093833818,1.0,0.918226344538414,0.8420694720405995

Transfer learning can significantly improve performance on a task, especially when the task is related to the pre-trained model's original task. The amount of improvement can vary depending on the specific task, dataset, and pre-trained model used.

Here are some general guidelines on the improvement in performance that transfer learning can bring:

1. Image classification tasks: Transfer learning can improve performance by 10-20% or more, depending on the dataset and pre-trained model used. For example, a pre-trained model trained on ImageNet can improve performance on a new image classification task by 15-25%.
2. Natural language processing tasks: Transfer learning can improve performance by 20-40% or more, depending on the dataset and pre-trained model used. For example, a pre-trained model trained on a large corpus of text can improve performance on a new text classification task by 30-50%.
3. Speech recognition tasks: Transfer learning can improve performance by 10-30% or more, depending on the dataset and pre-trained model used. For example, a pre-trained model trained on a large dataset of speech can improve performance on a new speech recognition task by 20-30%.
4. Other tasks: The improvement in performance from transfer learning can vary widely depending on the specific task and dataset. For example, in a sentiment analysis task, transfer learning can improve performance by 10-20%, while in a more complex task like question answering, the improvement can be 30-50% or more.

It's important to note that these are general guidelines, and the actual improvement in performance will depend on the specifics of the task, dataset, and pre-trained model used. Additionally, the improvement in performance may not always be linear with the amount of pre-training data used",0.0661157008264463,0.0099009889814725,0.0661157008264463,1.8738049339091585e-05,5.007752889197689,4.2465070258967685,0.1438073824245831,0.0100334448160535,0.5424134135246277,0.3009322222710869,0.2760993242263794,0.66618633,0.0136013795096082,1.0,0.9126782413193848,0.7999097803707895

Here's how they are trained differently:

1. BERTbase:
	* Pretrained on a smaller dataset with approximately 30,000 books.
	* Used for fine-tuning on specific downstream tasks.
	* Has a smaller number of parameters (approximately 110M) compared to BERTlarge.
2. BERTlarge:
	* Pretrained on a larger dataset with approximately 100,000 books.
	* Has more parameters (approximately 340M) compared to BERTbase.
	* Requires more computational resources and time to pretrain (approximately 2-3 days using an NVIDIA GeForce GTX Ti).

The pretraining process for both models involves using an unsupervised data set and optimizing the model's parameters to predict the missing word in a sequence of words. The key difference is that BERTlarge is pretrained on a larger dataset and has more parameters, which allows it to capture more context and relationships between words.

In terms of fine-tuning, both models are trained on a small training set, but the training time for BERTlarge is longer due to its larger size and more parameters.

However, we can infer some potential negative effects based on the description of the techniques and their purpose.

1. Adaptive schedules: The use of adaptive schedules to control the validation process may lead to a higher number of iterations and longer training times, which could potentially negatively impact the performance on high-resource tasks.
2. Multilingual machine translation: The proposed technique for multilingual machine translation may lead to a decrease in performance on high-resource tasks, as the model is trained on a combination of low-resource and high-resource tasks. This could result in the model being less specialized in the high-resource tasks and potentially leading to lower performance.
3. Task weights: The use of task weights to control the optimization process may lead to a bias towards low-resource tasks, potentially negatively impacting the performance on high-resource tasks.
4. Bleu scores: The use of Bleu scores as the evaluation metric may not accurately reflect the performance on high-resource tasks, as Bleu scores are biased towards tasks with more data. This could lead to a decrease in performance on high-resource tasks.

Overall, the negative effects of the proposed techniques on high-resource tasks are likely to be minor and may not significantly impact the performance.

Here's a brief overview of each technique and the languages they are applied to:

1. Data extraction: The context mentions extracting data from WMT English-French and English-German tasks. These tasks are popular benchmarks for machine translation, and the data is typically extracted in the form of parallel corpora, which consist of pairs of sentences in the source and target languages.
2. Artificial data imbalance: To create a larger discrepancy between the training data sizes for EN-FR and EN-DE, the context suggests artificially restricting the EN-FR dataset to almost half a million parallel sentences, while using a full EN-FR dataset comprising almost a million parallel sentences for the other two language pairs. This technique is used to address the issue of dataset imbalance, where one language pair has significantly more data than the others.
3. Joint vocabulary: The context mentions using a joint vocabulary of k tokens, which suggests that the model is trained on a shared vocabulary across all three language pairs. This is a common approach in multilingual machine translation, where the model is trained on a single vocabulary that includes words and subwords from all languages.
4. Tokenization: The context mentions tokenizing the output and computing BLEU scores using the tokenized output. BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a widely used evaluation metric for machine translation, which measures the quality of the translation based on the similarity between the generated output and the reference output. Tokenization is the process of breaking down the output into individual words or subwords, which is necessary for computing BLEU scores.
5. Multi-bleu: The context mentions computing multiple BLEU scores using the tokenized output, which suggests that the model is trained to generate multiple reference outputs for each input sentence. This is a common approach in multilingual machine translation, where the model is trained to generate multiple translations for each input sentence, and the best translation is selected based on the BLEU score.

However, they differ in several ways:

1. Focus: Zipf's law focuses on the frequency of words in a language, while Herdan-Heap's law focuses on the vocabulary size of a text.
2. Scale: Zipf's law is typically applied to large corpora of text, while Herdan-Heap's law is more relevant to smaller texts or specific domains.
3. Power law: Zipf's law states that the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency list, following a power law distribution. Herdan-Heap's law, on the other hand, describes a logarithmic relationship between the vocabulary size of a text and the number of unique words it contains.
4. Universality: Zipf's law is considered a universal principle that applies across different languages and domains, while Herdan-Heap's law is more specific to the domain of natural language processing.
5. Interpretation: Zipf's law is often interpreted as a result of the inherent structure of language, while Herdan-Heap's law is seen as a consequence of the way texts are composed and the limitations of human memory.

3. Machine learning model: The system uses a machine learning model to predict the next minute's bitcoin price given the historical data and real-time tweets.
4. Actual price: The system compares the predicted price with the actual price arrived and calculates the root mean squared (RMS) value.
5. Checkpointing: The system stores the calculated values in a Hive database for a certain period of time.

Therefore, the experimental evaluation methods used are:

1. Predictive accuracy: The system evaluates the accuracy of its predictions by comparing the predicted prices with the actual prices.
2. RMS value: The system calculates the RMS value to measure the difference between the predicted and actual prices.

1. Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs): Spark's RDDs are the fundamental data structure in Spark, and they are designed to be fault-tolerant. RDDs are distributed across multiple nodes in the cluster, and each node maintains a copy of the data. This means that if one node fails, the data can still be accessed from other nodes.
2. Multiset data: Spark's RDDs can store data in a multiset, which means that each element can be stored multiple times across different nodes. This helps to ensure that the data is still available even if some nodes fail.
3. Distributed cluster: Spark's architecture is designed to run on a distributed cluster, which means that there are multiple nodes that can take over the workload if one node fails.
4. Fault tolerance in Spark applications: Spark applications can be designed to run in separate processes, and each process can be run on a different node. This means that if one process fails, the other processes can continue to run and maintain the system's overall availability.
5. SparkContext: SparkContext is the main driver program that connects the cluster manager and helps acquire executors on different nodes. It also helps to allocate resources across applications.
6. Lineage graph: Spark's lineage graph is a data structure that tracks the execution steps of a Spark application. This allows Spark to recover previous executions and build a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of the execution steps.
7. In-memory caching: Spark's in-memory caching helps to reduce the need for disk I/O and can help to improve performance and fault tolerance.
8. Duplicate copies of RDDs in Apache Hive: Apache Hive stores previous states of the machine learning model in duplicate copies of RDDs. This allows KryptoOracle to easily recover previous steady-state faults, even in the case of memory overload or system crashes.

Overall, Spark's architecture is designed to be highly scalable and fault-tolerant, with multiple layers of redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure that the system remains available and performs well even under heavy loads and failures",0.0537634396531391,0.0064308674848275,0.0430107514810961,9.391879050234782e-12,3.7091657974693417,3.018524631158429,0.1183426443202979,0.0099292398995663,0.46803680062294,0.0,0.5244176387786865,0.61843044,0.0044477300929405,1.0,0.9464729109018438,0.806594809945291

Based on the given context, the following metrics are used for performance evaluation:

1. Overall Accuracy: This is the standard metric used to evaluate the performance of the model on the float selected table blue tasks. It measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all the instances in the test dataset.
2. Microaverage Precision, Recall, and F-score: These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model on the relation extraction task. Microaverage is a way of averaging the precision, recall, and F-score across all the instances in the test dataset. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions, recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances, and F-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
3. Strict Version Precision, Recall, and F-score: These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model on the named entity recognition task. They are similar to the microaverage precision, recall, and F-score, but they are more strict in their evaluation criteria. For example, for precision, a prediction is considered correct only if it exactly matches the ground truth.
4. Pearson Correlation Coefficients: This metric is used to evaluate the performance of the sentence similarity task. It measures the linear correlation between the predicted similarity scores and the ground truth similarity scores. A high correlation coefficient indicates a good performance.

It's worth noting that the metrics used for performance evaluation may vary depending on the specific task and the goals of the evaluation.

This is done using a mapping function that assigns each word in the source language sentence to a word in the target language sentence, and vice versa. The alignment is done in a way that ensures that the AMR nodes corresponding to the words in the source language sentence are also aligned with the corresponding words in the target language sentence.

The approach used for annotation projection depends on the underlying assumption that the source word and the target word should be aligned, and that the AMR node corresponding to the source word should also be aligned with the target word. This is formally defined using a mapping function that assigns each word in the source language sentence to a word in the target language sentence, and vice versa. The alignment is done using a function that takes the word tokens in the source language sentence and maps them to the word tokens in the target language sentence, while also ensuring that the AMR nodes corresponding to the words in the source language sentence are aligned with the corresponding words in the target language sentence.

To generate word alignments, the text suggests using FastAlign or JamR, which are bibref-based alignment tools. These tools can generate word alignments for multiple languages, including English, German, Chinese, Spanish, Italian, and others. The text also mentions that AMReager, an open-source AMR parser, can be modified to reuse languages, and that multilingual adaptation of AMReager is available at <http://www.github.com/mdtux/amreager-multilingual>. This adaptation requires tokenization, POS tagging, NER tagging, and dependency parsing for English, German, Chinese, and other languages.

In summary, annotation projection for languages with different word orders is done by aligning words in the source language sentence with words in the target language sentence, while also aligning the corresponding AMR nodes. This is done using a mapping function that assigns each word in the source language sentence to a word in the target language sentence, and vice versa. The alignment is done using bibref-based alignment tools such as FastAlign or JamR, and the multilingual adaptation of AMReager can be used to reuse languages",0.0944881871386943,0.0,0.0944881871386943,6.758578195990395e-11,3.0497153239468338,2.542842740757452,0.0860585197934595,0.0099521778467106,0.5345434546470642,0.4227437153458595,0.1362446695566177,0.5642232,0.0013939371755265,1.0,0.9863369549010336,0.8336987674430502

To ensure the accuracy of the annotations, a quality control process was likely performed to mitigate the impact of the noise in the text. Here are some possible steps that may have been taken:

1. Pre-processing: The dataset may have undergone pre-processing steps such as tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal to clean the text and remove irrelevant information.
2. Contextual filtering: The annotators may have been instructed to only annotate mentions that are contextually relevant and coherent. This would have helped to reduce the impact of incoherent contexts and ensure that the annotations are accurate.
3. Ground truth validation: The ground truth links and mentions may have been validated by a separate set of annotators or by using automated tools to ensure that they are correct and accurate.
4. Consistency checks: The annotations may have been checked for consistency across different annotators and across different pages to ensure that the annotations are reliable and accurate.
5. Noise reduction: Any mentions or links that were deemed to be noise or irrelevant may have been removed from the dataset.
6. Resolution of ambiguities: Any ambiguities or conflicts in the annotations may have been resolved through discussions among the annotators or by using automated tools to resolve the conflicts.

1. Automatic metrics: These are quantitative measures that use mathematical algorithms to evaluate the quality of generated text. Some commonly used automatic metrics include:
	* N-gram based similarity metrics: These metrics measure the similarity between the generated text and a reference text, based on the frequency of certain n-grams (sequences of n words) in the text.
	* Perplexity: This metric measures how well the generated text fits the reference text, based on the probability of the generated words given the reference text.
2. Human evaluation: This involves asking human evaluators to assess the quality of the generated text, using a subjective evaluation framework. The evaluators may be asked to rate the generated text on a scale, such as a Likert scale, to measure its answerability, grammatical correctness, and relevance to the context.

The text you provided mentions that the authors used a combination of automatic metrics and human evaluation to assess the quality of the generated questions. They used a dataset of non-conversational QA questions and randomly sampled test sets to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach.

1. Using contextual gating mechanism: The system uses a contextual gating mechanism to combine the conversational context embeddings and speech word embeddings effectively. The gating mechanism computes a gate value dependent on the context and multiple utterances in the conversation. This allows the system to decide how to weigh different embeddings based on the conversational context, leading to improved representational power using multiplicative interactions.
2. Using BERT models: The system uses BERT models to generate single dimensional sentence embeddings, which are then combined with the conversational context embeddings. The BERT models are trained on a large corpus of text data and can learn complex characteristics of words in various contexts. The system can use different merging methods, such as concatenation or average, to combine the sentence and context embeddings.

In both cases, the goal is to obtain dense informative fixed-length vectors that encode conversational context information and speech word embeddings, which can be used for next utterance prediction. The use of sentence embeddings in the speech recognition system allows it to capture the context and meaning of the conversation, leading to improved performance and accuracy",0.1159420259273262,0.0099502464305344,0.1159420259273262,0.013205663187718,13.035016717578388,10.657420163734995,0.2100468783294268,0.0101994674169723,0.7788116931915283,0.2194184072029132,0.4663852453231811,0.6430537,0.0027775497553479,0.7142857142857143,0.9999987420649612,0.9035454142862958

In the context of the given text, the causal attribution networks are derived from three datasets of text pairs that reflect cause-effect relationships, such as the relationship between a virus and sickness.

A causal attribution network is a directed graph, where nodes represent variables or entities, and directed edges represent causal relationships between them. The direction of the edges is important, as it indicates the direction of causality between the nodes. For example, in the case of the virus and sickness, the edge from the virus node to the sickness node would indicate that the virus causes sickness.

The nodes in the network can be further annotated with additional information, such as the strength of the causal relationship or the probability of the relationship. The networks can also be used to identify semantically equivalent statements that describe the same cause-effect relationship, and to deal with issues of ambiguity and uncertainty in the data.

Overall, causal attribution networks are a useful tool for representing and analyzing complex cause-effect relationships in a structured and visual way, and can be applied in a variety of domains, including healthcare, finance, and social science",0.1016949135636311,0.0312499989198134,0.1016949135636311,2.8813270730080944e-06,7.560787594875844,6.342188930372332,0.0958904109589041,0.0099481174734637,0.654301106929779,0.0,0.3668550252914428,0.693206,0.0075079575028262,1.0,1.000000000000001,0.8805346704236262

3. Social and cultural aspects: The researchers considered whether the tweet perpetuated negative stereotypes or prejudices about a particular group, or whether it advocated for the superiority of one group over another.

The researchers did not rely solely on explicit language or physical characteristics to determine if a tweet was racist. Instead, they used a more nuanced approach that considered the broader social and cultural context of the language used. This approach is in line with the Belgian anti-racism law, which prohibits discrimination and violence based on physical qualities like skin color, nationality, and ethnicity, as well as negative generalizations and stereotypes.

The researchers also looked for language that explicitly encouraged the use of violence or illegal activities, as this would be punishable under the law.

The model takes as input the logical form generated by the parser and the utterance, and outputs a score indicating the likelihood that the generated logical form is correct.

The model is trained to maximize the log-likelihood of the correct answer, which is done by treating the logical forms as latent variables and maximizing the log-likelihood of the correct answer given the utterance and the generated logical form.

To compute the likelihood, the model uses global features that are generated during the decoding process. These global features capture information about the entire utterance, such as the speaker's intent and the context in which the utterance is being used. The model then uses these global features to conditionally generate the logical form, following a specific tree traversal order.

The ranker system introduced in the previous work uses a similar approach, but relies solely on the neural decoder to find the likely logical form. In contrast, the current model introduces a ranker that scores candidate logical forms generated by the parser, and uses the highest-scoring logical form for execution at test time. This approach allows for more accurate and efficient execution of the semantic denotation, as the ranker can leverage global features to discriminate between candidate logical forms",0.122137402792378,0.0384615372896635,0.106870227219859,1.821006837216096e-05,7.03607582366619,6.087760281370333,0.2126627874757551,0.0101646766389986,0.4621979594230652,0.5384615384615384,0.573264479637146,0.35278872,0.0474968464388298,0.7,0.8202736594341449,0.812567389836186

In the context of a table of results, baselines are often used as a reference point to compare the performance of the model being evaluated against a known, high-performing model or algorithm. For example, if a model is trained on a specific dataset and achieves a certain score, the baseline score might be the score achieved by a model trained on the same dataset but with a different algorithm or set of hyperparameters.

In the context of a valid test dataset, the baselines might be the scores achieved by the model on a set of pre-defined test datasets that are known to be challenging or representative of the problem being solved.

Overall, the baselines provide a point of comparison for evaluating the performance of the model and can help to determine whether the model is performing well or poorly relative to what is expected",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4416358408206766,0.3312268806155074,0.0,0.0099009900990099,0.0465220250189304,1.0,0.5620538592338562,0.02121445,0.0053708378701299,1.0,0.9016856991087884,0.7106275382792171
890,What semantic features help in detecting whether a piece of text is genuine or generated? of ,['many practical fake news detection algorithms use kind semantic side information whether generated text factually correct addition statistical properties . although statistical side information would straightforward incorporate hypothesis testing framework remains understand cast semantic knowledge statistical decision theory framework .'],['feature given discussion semantic features use practice yet discovered embed knowledge statistical decision theory framework .'],"There are several semantic features that can help detect whether a piece of text is genuine or generated. Some of these features include:

1. Coherence: Genuine text tends to be more coherent and have a clear structure, while generated text may lack coherence and appear disjointed or nonsensical.
2. Contextual relevance: Genuine text is more likely to be contextually relevant, while generated text may be out of place or lack contextual relevance.
3. Consistency: Genuine text tends to be more consistent in terms of style, tone, and language usage, while generated text may be inconsistent or have varying styles.
4. Grammatical correctness: Genuine text is more likely to be grammatically correct, while generated text may contain errors or be grammatically incorrect.
5. Lexical diversity: Genuine text tends to have a more diverse range of words and phrases, while generated text may use a limited set of words and phrases.
6. Semantic consistency: Genuine text tends to be more semantically consistent, while generated text may contain inconsistencies or contradictions.
7. Sentence structure: Genuine text tends to have more complex sentence structures, while generated text may have simpler sentence structures.
8. Word order: Genuine text tends to have a more natural word order, while generated text may have a less natural word order.

These semantic features can be used as input to a machine learning model, such as a deep learning neural network, to train a fake news detector. The model can learn to identify patterns in the semantic features that distinguish genuine text from generated text.

Incorporating statistical properties, such as those obtained from hypothesis testing or statistical decision theory, can also improve the accuracy of fake news detection. These statistical properties can be used to quantify the uncertainty of the model's predictions and to make more informed decisions about the authenticity of the text.

Overall, a combination of semantic features and statistical properties can provide a more comprehensive approach to fake news detection, and can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions",0.057803466529453,0.0149253720775785,0.057803466529453,5.1980231273966266e-08,4.412389976443936,3.6739422865698224,0.1137387387387387,0.0099596869812663,0.1652115881443023,0.5578089990256506,0.5020097494125366,0.675305,0.0053285512713743,1.0,0.9837021147175355,0.8207271378361642

Stationarity assumes that the statistical properties of the language remain constant over time, which may not be true for all languages or all contexts. For example, language use can change over time due to social or cultural factors, and language varieties can exhibit changes in grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation over time. Moreover, language production can be influenced by external factors such as the speaker's age, gender, or social background, which can result in variations in language use.

Ergodicity assumes that the language is a Markov process, meaning that the future state of the language is determined solely by its current state, and not by any of its past states. This assumption is often violated in natural language, as the probability of a word or phrase is influenced by the context in which it is used, and the context can be influenced by the previous words or phrases in the sequence.

However, despite these limitations, the assumptions of stationarity and ergodicity are often made in natural language processing tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, and text classification, as they simplify the analysis and allow for more tractable mathematical formulations. In these cases, the assumptions are made with the understanding that the models are approximations and may not capture all of the complexities of natural language.

Moreover, recent advances in deep learning-based models have relaxed the assumptions of stationarity and ergodicity by incorporating non-linear and non-local dependencies in the data. These models, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU), have been shown to be effective in modeling natural language variability and context-dependent phenomena.

In summary, the assumptions of stationarity and ergodicity are useful approximations in natural language processing, but they are not always valid. The limitations of these assumptions can be addressed by using more advanced models that capture the non-linear and non-local dependencies in the data",0.0465116268117901,0.0,0.0232558128583018,2.9574364798853925e-12,2.693757766256792,2.1857609548100307,0.0604838709677419,0.0099300781479522,0.368235170841217,0.3865229361935665,0.2533401846885681,0.72479904,0.0086805512338337,0.8,0.9372054406568608,0.7924435625430567

The model's primary goal is to mitigate the inclusion of irrelevant and noisy words in the text and to select words that are related to the target entities.

However, it is possible to extend the ConMask model to add new relations to the knowledge graph. One possible approach is to modify the model's architecture to include a relation prediction task, where the model predicts the likelihood of a new relation existing between two entities. This could be done by adding a new output layer to the model that predicts the probability of a new relation, and using this output as a signal to determine whether a new relation should be added to the knowledge graph.

Alternatively, the model could be trained on a dataset that includes both entities and relations, and the model could learn to predict both entity and relation embeddings. In this case, the model could be used to add new relations to the knowledge graph by identifying pairs of entities that are likely to have a previously unknown relation.

Overall, while the ConMask model is primarily designed for entity disambiguation and relation masking, it could potentially be extended to add new relations to the knowledge graph with some modifications to the model's architecture and training data",0.0840336123381117,0.029999999418,0.0840336123381117,2.702680972804417e-10,2.856063105517814,2.6141732535367868,0.158005617977528,0.0100219995111219,0.6272634863853455,1.0,0.4486473798751831,0.593147,0.011515297580362,1.0,0.7191553518320518,0.7923151799063051

1. Multi-task learning: The authors of the paper propose training a single NMT model on multiple languages, which enables the model to learn shared representations across languages.

This is because the model has learned shared representations across languages during the training process.
5. Vector-based interlingua: The authors suggest that their model can be used to learn a vector-based interlingua, which is a shared representation of words or phrases across multiple languages. This can be useful for transfer learning, as it allows the model to transfer knowledge from one language to another.

In summary, the NMT models can learn transfer learning in terms of multi-task learning, multisource models, language flags, transfer learning, and vector-based interlingua. These techniques can enable the models to learn shared representations across languages and improve the transfer learning process",0.0461538454142011,0.0180995471558731,0.0461538454142011,3.885649585720493e-18,2.5118601664996665,2.1358294741445945,0.0826243455497382,0.0099009900990099,0.6247954964637756,0.608901355407431,0.4511457979679107,0.2974649,0.0061025438620038,1.0,0.9446349525487668,0.8536471873633984

1. Manual transcription: The first group of tokens is manually transcribed, and the training and test data sets are created with a 5-fold cross-validation setting.
2. Removing French tokens: French tokens are removed from the data to prevent codeswitching, and the remaining sentences are used for training and testing.
3. Tokenization: The Arabic text is tokenized into individual tokens, and each token is annotated with its corresponding morpheme.
4. Incremental annotation: The annotation process is done incrementally, with each block of tokens being annotated separately.
5. Model training: A neural model is trained on the annotated data to learn the mapping between Arabic characters and morphemes.
6. Token-level accuracy: The model's accuracy is evaluated at the token level, and the result is found to be satisfactory, although the absolute scale is not as high as expected due to the small size of the data.
7. Adding more data: To improve the accuracy of the model, additional tokens are added to the training data, and a new block of annotated data is created.
8. Incremental annotation with manual correction: The model is trained on the new block of data, and the accuracy is evaluated. The model is found to have a high accuracy, and the manually corrected annotations are added to the training data.
9. Repeat the process: The process of adding more data, training the model, and evaluating its accuracy is repeated until the entire corpus is annotated.

Overall, the semi-automatic construction process involves a combination of manual annotation, tokenization, and training of a neural model to transcribe Arabic text. The process is iterative, with each block of annotations being used to train the model and improve its accuracy",0.0536912739155894,0.0,0.0536912739155894,4.4959505369197695e-12,4.076344459314435,3.2833552156529127,0.0759219088937093,0.0099342193583031,0.5501633882522583,0.7475790373505431,0.4362854361534118,0.32886824,0.0042197880756043,1.0,0.8835470195926273,0.8570813014502192

In other words, the framework explicitly uses the fact that the QA and QG tasks are related in a probabilistic sense to guide the training of both models. This is done by introducing a regularization term that reflects the probabilistic correlation between the two tasks, and by minimizing this term during training.

By leveraging the probabilistic correlation between the QA and QG tasks, the training framework can improve the performance of both models. This is because the QA and QG models are not independent, but rather they are related in a way that can be exploited to improve the training process.

In more detail, the framework is using the fact that the QA and QG models are both trying to predict the same underlying distribution (i.e., the probability of a correct answer given a question) to guide the training of both models.

The first quote mentions that the task of pos tagging is ideal for contemplating syntactic understanding, and that contextual word embeddings can be used to evaluate the ability of the model to capture syntax. This suggests that the task of pos tagging may be more sensitive to the language typology than other tasks.

The second quote states that much of the information in the textsc BERT representations is already captured by simple type-level baselines, and that the gains from using textsc BERT are small and even negative for some languages. This suggests that the performance of textsc BERT may vary depending on the language typology, with some languages benefiting more from the use of textsc BERT than others.

The third quote notes that textsc BERT improves upon fasttext for three out of six analysed languages, and even encodes additional information in English.

The key idea of using a combination of NMT and SMT to translate technical terms in patent sentences is not limited to the domain of Japanese and Chinese patents. The approach can be applied to other technical domains where technical terms need to be translated accurately, such as in the fields of engineering, computer science, and biotechnology.

The approach is based on the observation that technical terms in patent sentences often have specific meanings and connotations that need to be preserved in the translation. By using a combination of NMT and SMT, the approach can leverage the strengths of both methods to achieve high-quality translations of technical terms.

The paper proposes a method for identifying technical term pairs in patent sentences and replacing them with special tokens during the NMT training process. This allows the NMT model to learn the patterns and structures of technical terms in the source language and generate accurate translations in the target language. The SMT system is then used to translate the special tokens back into the original technical terms in the target language, ensuring that the technical terms are accurately translated and preserved in the final translation.

The approach can be applied to other technical domains by identifying the technical terms in the source language and replacing them with special tokens during the training process. The NMT model can then be trained on the modified source language, and the SMT system can be used to translate the special tokens back into the original technical terms in the target language.

In summary, the approach proposed in the paper can be generalized to other technical domains by identifying and replacing technical terms with special tokens during the NMT training process, and using an SMT system to translate the special tokens back into the original technical terms in the target language.

The paper highlights the importance of taking into account the inherent morphological complexity of languages when developing NLP methods, as the amount of semantic and grammatical information encoded at the word level can vary significantly across languages.

The authors suggest that existing NLP methods may not be adequate for analyzing languages with complex morphologies, and that adapting these methods to account for morphological complexity could lead to improved performance. They also suggest that analyzing the relationship between word forms and their underlying morphological structure could be useful for measuring the impact of different word form normalization tools on NLP tasks, and could help to identify the most effective methods for different languages.

Some potential practical applications of this research include:

1. Improving the accuracy of NLP tasks in languages with complex morphologies, such as information retrieval, machine translation, and text summarization.
2. Developing more effective methods for morphological normalization, which could be used to preprocess text data before performing NLP tasks.
3. Providing a better understanding of the relationship between word forms and their underlying morphological structure, which could be useful for linguistic analysis and language learning.
4. Informing the development of language resources and tools, such as dictionaries and grammar checkers, that are designed to support NLP tasks in languages with complex morphologies.

1. Extractor: The extractor consists of a neural network that encodes the source document and chooses a subset of sentences (denoted as $\hat{d}$) to form a summary. The extractor learns to pick a subset of sentences from the original document (denoted as $d$) by using a hat (${\hat{}}$) symbol.
2. Abstractor: The abstractor is a neural network that takes the selected sentences ($\hat{d}$) and rewrites them into a summary (denoted as $f(\hat{d})$) using a compressive function. The abstractor network approximates the function $f$ that compresses the paraphrases of the extracted document into a concise summary sentence.

The method also uses a pre-trained BERT encoder to contextualize the input sequence of sentences and a decoder to select the sentences based on their representations.

Dilated convolutions are a variation of standard convolutions, where the convolution kernel is applied to larger areas of the input data by skipping input values. This is achieved by dilating the convolution kernel with gaps between the kernel weights, effectively increasing the receptive field of the network without increasing the number of parameters.

In contrast to standard convolutions, which capture long temporal patterns in a relatively small model, dilated convolutions can operate at a larger scale without the downside of increasing the number of parameters. This allows the network to capture longer-term dependencies in the input data, while maintaining a reasonable model size.

The text also mentions that dilated convolutions have been inspired by WaveNet-style architectures and have been explored previously in text-to-speech applications, but have not been applied to key word spotting (KWS) tasks",0.1061946882293053,0.0129870115500085,0.1061946882293053,0.0003342934972334,8.116253061243137,6.791422771263286,0.1567398119122257,0.0099626400996264,0.508881688117981,0.990376697646247,0.6716027855873108,0.78587604,0.0888314268374648,0.8333333333333334,1.0000000000000009,0.8218903034940059

Here's what the context indicates that RDSN does:

1. Recurrent: RDSN is a recurrent neural network, meaning that it has feedback connections that allow information from previous time steps to influence the current step. This allows the network to capture temporal dependencies in the input data.
2. Deep: RDSN is a deep neural network, meaning that it has multiple layers of artificial neurons. This allows the network to learn complex patterns in the input data.
3. Stacking: RDSN is a stacking network, meaning that it combines the outputs of multiple networks to improve the overall performance. In the context of ASR, this means that the network combines the outputs of multiple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to improve the accuracy of the transcriptions.
4. Concatenates outputs: RDSN concatenates the outputs of previous frames and current frame input features to form the input to the next frame. This allows the network to capture long-term dependencies in the input data.
5. Projecting input features: RDSN projects the input features to a probability density output. This allows the network to output a probability distribution over the possible transcriptions, rather than a single transcription.
6. Clearer: RDSN is designed to provide a clearer output than conventional ASR systems. This is achieved by using a probabilistic output, which allows the network to indicate the uncertainty of the transcription.

In summary, RDSN is a type of neural network architecture that is designed to improve the performance of ASR systems by capturing temporal dependencies, learning complex patterns, and providing a clearer output",0.0601503748092034,0.009345793759717,0.0601503748092034,1.5437264396374065e-13,2.816618531002439,2.351218526615128,0.1120541674613771,0.009935385256722,0.3412384390830993,0.0930773244615186,0.1427254378795623,0.63164186,0.0018689274020231,1.0,0.9113364407372788,0.7337540371191391

* The reward for successfully completing a task is set to 1.0.
* The reward for failing to complete a task is set to 0.0.
* The reward for completing a dialog faster is discounted by a factor of g, where g is a hyperparameter that controls the discount rate.

In other words, the reward model is based on a binary reward system, where the agent receives a reward of 1.0 for completing a task successfully and a reward of 0.0 for failing to complete a task. The reward for completing a dialog faster is discounted by a factor of g, which encourages the agent to complete dialogs more quickly rather than slower.

The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative reward over a sequence of dialogs. The agent learns to complete tasks and dialogs more efficiently by trial and error, and the reward model provides feedback to the agent about the quality of its performance",0.1219512175580011,0.0145985390462998,0.1219512175580011,1.0606619723693237e-06,6.261826371197151,5.191805430372285,0.1016949152542373,0.0100729419937478,0.4265633523464203,0.5262672050545614,0.2939267456531524,0.7919485,0.0131571486712723,1.0,0.9532706190409584,0.7794074775153681

The task is to develop a computational model that can automatically recognize and quantify social norm violation in online community posts, taking into account both the verbal and visual cues in the posts, as well as the contextual information in which the posts are made.

The paper presents a dataset of online community posts that have been annotated for social norm violation, and provides a baseline model for recognizing social norm violation using bigram language models and cross-entropy value deviation. However, the authors note that existing models are trained on written language instead of natural face-to-face dialog, and that there is a need for more research on the nature of social norm violation in online communities.

The paper also proposes a new approach to recognizing sarcasm in tweets, which involves developing a classifier that can identify specific types of sarcasm in tweets based on the use of positive and negative sentiment phrases. The approach utilizes a bootstrapping algorithm to automatically extract lists of positive and negative sentiment phrases from sarcastic tweets, and then leverages these phrases to recognize sarcasm in new tweets.

Overall, the paper presents a new task for improving the performance of automatic recognition of social norm violation in online communities, and provides a baseline model and a new approach to recognizing sarcasm in tweets. Other researchers can try to improve upon these approaches and develop more accurate and effective models for recognizing social norm violation in online communities",0.0645161279669615,0.0294117641349481,0.0645161279669615,5.7696718899230426e-11,2.7959260106673014,2.486587224914242,0.1524390243902439,0.0099763917447262,0.3286944329738617,0.619637950261434,0.4411996006965637,0.7683626,0.0112820977629727,0.6666666666666666,0.8476949778297883,0.850232160964098
